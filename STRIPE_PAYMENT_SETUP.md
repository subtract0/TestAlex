# 🚀 Complete Stripe Payment Integration Setup Guide

## Overview

I've implemented a complete **€7 ACIM Course Payment System** for your spiritual AI platform! This integration maintains full spiritual integrity while unlocking revenue generation.

## 📋 What's Been Created

### 1. Firebase Functions (Backend)
- `createPaymentIntent` - Creates Stripe payment intent for €7 courses
- `confirmPayment` - Confirms payment and grants course access
- `stripeWebhook` - Handles Stripe webhook events
- `getCourseAccess` - Check user course access
- `getCourseContent` - Retrieve purchased course content

### 2. Frontend Interface
- `public/course-purchase.html` - Complete purchase interface with:
  - Firebase Authentication integration
  - Stripe payment form
  - Course selection interface
  - Responsive design
  - Spiritual integrity messaging

### 3. Course Content System
- Authentic ACIM course content for 3 different courses:
  - **14-Day ACIM Journey** (€7)
  - **ACIM Forgiveness Mastery** (€7) 
  - **ACIM Miracle Principles** (€7)

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Get Stripe Keys

1. Go to https://stripe.com and create an account
2. Get your keys from the Dashboard:
   - **Publishable Key** (starts with `pk_test_`)
   - **Secret Key** (starts with `sk_test_`)
   - **Webhook Secret** (starts with `whsec_`)

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Add these to your Firebase Functions environment:

```bash
cd /home/am/TestAlex/functions

# Set Stripe secret key
firebase functions:config:set stripe.secret_key="sk_test_your_secret_key_here"

# Set Stripe webhook secret (after creating webhook)
firebase functions:config:set stripe.webhook_secret="whsec_your_webhook_secret_here"
```

Or add to `.env` file in functions directory:
```env
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_secret_key_here
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_secret_here
```

### Step 3: Update Frontend Configuration

In `public/course-purchase.html`, replace these placeholders:

```javascript
// Line 334: Replace with your Firebase config
const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "your-actual-api-key",
    authDomain: "acim-guide-test.firebaseapp.com", // or your domain
    projectId: "acim-guide-test", // or your project ID
    storageBucket: "acim-guide-test.appspot.com",
    messagingSenderId: "your-sender-id",
    appId: "your-app-id"
};

// Line 345: Replace with your Stripe publishable key
const stripe = Stripe('pk_test_your_actual_publishable_key');
```

### Step 4: Deploy Functions

```bash
cd /home/am/TestAlex

# Deploy the new payment functions
firebase deploy --only functions
```

### Step 5: Set Up Stripe Webhooks

1. Go to Stripe Dashboard → Webhooks
2. Add endpoint: `https://your-project-id.cloudfunctions.net/stripeWebhook`
3. Select events:
   - `payment_intent.succeeded`
   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`
4. Copy webhook secret and add to environment variables

### Step 6: Test the System

1. Open `public/course-purchase.html` in your browser
2. Sign in with Firebase Auth
3. Select a course
4. Use Stripe test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
5. Complete purchase and verify course access is granted
