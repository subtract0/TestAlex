# Windsurf Rules — ACIMguide / CourseGPT

These rules encode my working preferences for Windsurf’s **Rules & Memories**.

---

## 1) User Rules (global)
1. **Before any code or destructive change**, follow this protocol and pause for my confirmation:
   - **Summarize** my request in 2–3 sentences.
   - **Plan**: list the minimal steps you’ll take.
   - **Clarify**: list only essential questions or assumptions.
   - **Wait** for my “Go” before editing files, running migrations, or making API calls.
2. **Search first.** When debugging or proposing code changes, **read relevant files and search official docs** before guessing. Prefer primary sources.
3. **Be concise.** Default to **English**, minimize fluff, ask only critical questions.
4. **Deliverables** must be copy‑pastable: commands and code blocks should be ready to run.

---

## 2) Debugging / Code‑change Protocol
1. **Understand**: read the failing stack trace, related files, and recent commits.
2. **Hypothesis**: propose the most likely cause in one or two sentences.
3. **Plan**: list the smallest experiment to validate the hypothesis.
4. **Implement** only after I say “Go”; include commands and expected outputs.
5. **Verify**: show how to confirm success and note any side effects.

---

## 3) Memory & Context
1. Persist stable preferences: Poetry usage; summarize‑plan‑clarify‑confirm workflow; search‑first behavior.
2. **Do not store secrets** (keys, tokens) in memory.
3. Always include local **rules/docs** in your context when available (e.g., `.windsurf/*`, `.cursorRules`, `rules/*.mdc`, `docs/specs.md`, `README.md`). Cite filenames/sections when you rely on them.

---

## 4) Chat & Output Style
- Keep answers short and practical.
- Provide **one** sharp follow‑up question only when essential.
- Use bullet points for steps; avoid verbosity.
- Prefer **exact quotes with citations** when quoting source documents; otherwise paraphrase clearly.

---

## 5) Guardrails
- Never make irreversible changes without explicit approval.
- If you’re unsure or missing access, stop and ask for exactly what you need.
- When rate limits or external API errors occur, propose a local mock/test plan.
