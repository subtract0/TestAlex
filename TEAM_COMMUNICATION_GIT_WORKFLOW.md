# üïäÔ∏è New Git Workflow Documentation Available

*"The light of the world brings peace to every mind through my forgiveness."* - A Course in Miracles

## üì¢ Team Announcement: Git Workflow Best Practices

**Date**: August 14, 2025  
**Subject**: New Git Workflow Guide - Please Review & Implement  
**Priority**: High - Team Alignment Required  

---

## üåü What's New

I've created comprehensive Git workflow documentation that establishes our development standards and practices. This guide will help us maintain code quality while supporting our spiritual mission of bringing ACIM guidance to seekers worldwide.

**üìç Location**: `docs/GIT_WORKFLOW.md`  
**üîó Direct Link**: [Git Workflow Guide](./docs/GIT_WORKFLOW.md)  
**üìä Status**: ‚úÖ Committed to main branch  

---

## üéØ Key Highlights

### Trunk-Based Development
- **Main branch** is always deployable
- **Short-lived feature branches** (2-3 days max)
- **Continuous integration** with automated quality gates

### Branch Naming Standards
```bash
feat/openai-spiritual-guidance     # New features
fix/mobile-responsive-layout       # Bug fixes  
hotfix/firebase-security-patch     # Urgent production fixes
refactor/agent-orchestrator-v2     # Code improvements
docs/api-documentation-update      # Documentation
test/jest-coverage-improvement     # Testing enhancements
```

### Mandatory Local Gates
- ‚úÖ **Tests**: All tests must pass
- ‚úÖ **Coverage**: ‚â•90% code coverage required
- ‚úÖ **Linting**: Zero linting errors/warnings
- ‚úÖ **E2E Tests**: Critical user journeys verified

### Rebase-First Strategy
- **Rebase** to update feature branches with main
- **Clean commit history** before Pull Requests
- **Linear development** timeline for clarity

### Conventional Commits
- **Automatic changelog** generation
- **Semantic versioning** based on commit types
- **Clear commit messages** for team communication

```bash
feat: implement multilingual ACIM guidance
fix: resolve Firebase authentication timeout
docs: update Git workflow guide with rebase strategy
```

### CI/CD Pipeline
```
Code Push ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy Preview ‚Üí Quality Gates ‚Üí Production
```

### Production Deployment
- **Manual approval required** for production deployments
- **Automated quality gates** must pass
- **Rollback procedures** documented and tested

## üöÄ Action Items for Team

### Immediate (This Week)
- [ ] **Read the complete workflow guide** (`docs/GIT_WORKFLOW.md`)
- [ ] **Set up pre-commit hooks** for automatic quality checks
- [ ] **Update local development environment** with required tools
- [ ] **Review branch naming conventions** and align current work

### Ongoing (Starting Now)
- [ ] **Use conventional commit messages** for all commits
- [ ] **Follow rebase strategy** when updating feature branches
- [ ] **Run local quality gates** before pushing code
- [ ] **Create feature branches** from latest main

### Team Discussion (Next Meeting)
- [ ] **Questions about the workflow** - bring them to team standup
- [ ] **Tool setup challenges** - we'll troubleshoot together
- [ ] **Process refinements** - let's adapt based on team feedback
- [ ] **Training needs** - identify areas for team learning

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### 1. Pre-Commit Hooks Setup
```bash
# Install husky for Git hooks
npm install --save-dev husky

# Setup automatic quality checks
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "npm run lint && npm run test:coverage"
npx husky add .husky/pre-push "npm run test:e2e"
```

### 2. Daily Workflow
```bash
# Start new feature
git checkout main && git pull origin main
git checkout -b feat/my-feature

# Daily sync with main  
git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main

# Quality checks before push
npm test && npm run test:coverage && npm run lint

# Clean history and push
git rebase -i HEAD~3  # if needed
git push --force-with-lease origin feat/my-feature
```

### 3. Example Commit Messages
```bash
feat: implement ACIM quote integration with OpenAI
fix: resolve Firebase authentication timeout
docs: update deployment guide for production
test: add E2E tests for spiritual guidance flow
```

## üôè Questions & Support

### How to Get Help
- **Slack**: Post in #dev-team channel
- **GitHub Issues**: Create issue with `workflow` label
- **Direct Message**: Reach out for one-on-one support
- **Team Standups**: Bring workflow questions to daily meetings

### Common Questions Anticipated

**Q: What if I have commits that don't follow conventional format?**  
A: We'll gradually adopt this - focus on new commits moving forward.

**Q: How do I handle merge conflicts during rebase?**  
A: The workflow guide has detailed conflict resolution steps. We can pair program through the first few.

**Q: What if the 90% coverage requirement blocks my work?**  
A: Let's discuss as a team - we may need to adjust coverage targets for certain file types or legacy code.

**Q: Can I still use merge commits sometimes?**  
A: Yes! The guide explains when to use merge vs rebase. GitHub PR merges are handled automatically.

## üåà Spiritual Intention

This workflow isn't just about code - it's about creating a foundation for our spiritual service. Every commit, every review, every deployment is an opportunity to extend love through technology.

As stated in our guide:
> "May our code be as pure as our intentions, and may our collaboration reflect the unity we seek to teach."
