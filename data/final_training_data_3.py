    "text_input": "Q #927: I'm wondering about Kundalini energy experiences in relation to A Course in Miracles. I have had these experiences and found them to be in opposition to the Course's direction. This has led me to believe that Kundalini is of the ego.",
    "output": "A Course in Miracles tells us that the entire world is false perception (W-pII.3.1:1) and was made as an attack on God (W-pII.3.2:1). The source of this false perception and attack is the ego. Therefore, everything that seems to be in this world is ego based. This includes our bodies and all the things they seem to think, feel, and do. Thus, you are correct that Kundalini energy experiences are of the ego. But this makes them no different from anything else the body appears to do including breathing, eating, and sleeping. In this dream world we think we inhabit, the body is the primary symbol of the ego's thought that we can be separate from God. When we listen to the ego, everything the body does symbolizes the ego's belief that, not only are we separate from God, but we need something more than God's Love to sustain us. And of course, as bodies we do have many needs. Because we are so thoroughly convinced that we are bodies, the Course does not ask us to deny any of our bodily needs. Nor does Jesus want us to feel guilty about what our bodies do. To the contrary, he seeks to teach us that we do not have to continue looking upon this world through the guilty, scared, and vicious eyes of the ego. He wants us to know that we can let go of the ego's clawed and gripping hand and turn instead to the Holy Spirit as our gentle internal Teacher. When we do that, the Holy Spirit will give everything we do a different purpose. The Course explains, \"The ego made the world ... but the Holy Spirit, the reinterpreter of what the ego made, sees the world as a teaching device for bringing you home\" (T-5.III.11:1). As Course students then, our only job is to change internal teachers. With everything we think, say, or do, we need to ask what is it for (T-24.VII.6:1). Or, more precisely, we need to begin with the premise that it was born of the ego's desire for attack and separation and ask the Holy Spirit to transform its purpose to one of forgiveness and remembering God's Love. The tricky part is, while we can be certain that this will lead us to an internal shift, we cannot be the judge of what this will or should look like on the outside. In other words, we do not know what love will lead us to say or do. Love might look like a kundalini energy experience. Or, it might look like letting go of striving for kundalini experiences. Remember that the Course does not address behavior. This is because from Jesus' perspective, behavior is totally irrelevant. He knows that in and of itself, behavior has no meaning. So, his concern is the mind that gives our actions all the meaning that they have for us. Jesus wants us to know that without the Holy Spirit's help we cannot judge anything the body does because we do not even know our own best interest (W-pI.24). When we recognize this, we open the door for the Holy Spirit to direct us. He will then teach us that because we chose the meaning of everything the body does, we can choose again. He will show us how, by changing our minds, all the things we made to keep us rooted in this world can become joyous reminders of our true home in Heaven."

    "text_input": "Q #928: For about three years, I've been obsessed with the corruption of our government and the poverty, terrorism, war, etc., that America has caused. This obsession has led to health problems for me. I find some comfort in writing about it and discussing the issue with certain people. I feel like I am accomplishing some little benefit, perhaps. A Course in Miracles teaches us to look at what we've done with a smile that says these thoughts have no effect on who I am, and \"Forgiveness ... is still, and quietly does nothing\" (W-pII.1.4:1:1). Ken has also said that a Course student could validly be involved in a situation, such as a war, and still be practicing the Course teaching. The main issue is which teacher we are following. I believe your answer to #873 addresses this issue, but it sure is frustrating. A: Questions #509 and #869 are also helpful with these issues. We will be brief in answering you, so as not to simply repeat our previous discussions. The lesson is, undoubtedly, a difficult one, perhaps the most difficult one of all. Applying the Course means being able to see corruption and dishonesty, etc., and to be able to disagree with the policy makers, while at the same time recognizing that these leaders are part of the same Sonship that you and everyone else are part of. To extend compassion to the \"victims\" of injustice and not to the \"victimizers\" is to indulge the ego's version of compassion and justice. And the inevitable result of that will always be conflict, guilt, and unhappiness. Exclusion is very costly to one's peace of mind, because it is",
    "output": "a denial of truth and reality. The Love of God is all-inclusive, and, therefore, as a reflection of this Love, Jesus enfolds everyone in his love, with no exceptions. He asks us to do the same, so that we will finally know who we are as God's Son: \"Come therefore unto me, and learn of the truth in you. The mind we share is shared by all our brothers, and as we see them truly they will be healed ... You can appreciate the Sonship only as one. This is part of the law of creation, and therefore governs all thought\" (T-7.V.11.1-2,7-8). This is also the central theme of Ken's recent book The Arch of Forgiveness, where he states: \"If you think of Jesus as total love and innocence, in whom shines the resplendence of Christ's light, you must be willing to share the same thought with those who seem to embody the ego's evil, darkness, and sin. If the light of Christ does not shine in all, it shines in none\" (p.13; this is also the theme of an audio set and the article in the Sept. 2004 The Lighthouse, both entitled \"The Arch of Forgiveness\"). The only way to do this is to try to rise above the battleground for an instant, beyond the perception of victims and victimizers (T-23.IV). You would then see that everyone shares the same agony of feeling orphaned and hopelessly stranded in a place that is not home. This is the content in the mind of everyone, government and military leaders, so-called evildoers, the seemingly downtrodden, and everyone else. The memory of our glorious Self as Christ is also in each mind, but it will remain concealed by the decision to condemn or exclude even one person. That is the importance, to the ego, of having enemies--we are kept apart from one another, and from our minds, where we would see both the shared pain and the memory of the love that binds us together as the one Son of God. Anger and accusations, thus, are very purposive--they are the effects of our choice to remain in a state of separation, but have it appear to be someone else's doing: the corrupt, incompetent leaders; the indifferent, selfish citizenry, etc. Jesus invites us to look at the price we are paying to hold onto the anger we feel is so justified, and then at some point ask ourselves whether it is worth it. He assures us that attacking others through condemnation is not sinful; but it is insane, and most importantly, is not really our will (T-23.IV.3:3; 4:6). The ego tries to convince us that we can feel justified in attacking others without hurting ourselves: \"For it is the ego's fundamental doctrine that what you do to others you have escaped. The ego wishes no one well. Yet its survival depends on your belief that you are exempt from its evil intentions. It counsels, therefore, that if you are host to it, it will enable you to direct its anger outward, thus protecting you ... the more anger you invest outside yourself, the safer you become\" (T-15.VII.4:2-6). Thus, Jesus asks that we look at this content in our minds with him, so that we will recognize the thought system we have chosen to identify with, and then honestly evaluate its worth in the light of the thought system of forgiveness he offers. Why would we withhold our forgiveness and love from even one person once we realize that by doing so we are excluding ourselves from the experience of Heaven's love and peace? That is the question he wants us to keep in the forefront of our minds, along with his assurance that we cannot drive him away should we continue to hold onto our anger and grievances. His love for us is unaffected by our choice for insanity."

    "text_input": "Q #929: A Course in Miracles states the ego \"sees no difference between miracle impulses and ego-alien beliefs of its own... [and] ...makes no distinctions between these two very different kinds of threat\" (T-9.VIII.3:1-2). I know this is comparing grandeur and grandiosity and the fact that the ego is aware of something else, greater than it \"out-there\" (or actually, in-there). But we are confused about what may indeed be the ego's own alien (not of or outside of itself?) beliefs. Is it accurate to say that the ego is constantly aware of this \"other\" presence? We know that it is not aware of the Holy Spirit (Voice for God) per se so would it be us as the decision maker? Exactly what are the two very different threats?",
    "output": "Miracle impulses of course emanate from the right-mind, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, and their purpose is to undo our belief in the ego. It is apparent why the ego would perceive such impulses as a threat, even though it cannot really understand them. Ego-alien beliefs, on the other hand, have their origins in the ego thought system, but represent the split off thoughts of the ego that it is attempting to deny responsibility for, including thoughts of attack and guilt and weakness and limitation, which, while inventions of the ego, need to be seen as outside itself to work as defenses. And so thoughts of revenge and destruction attributed to forces outside itself ironically trigger as much a sense of threat to the ego, even though paradoxically they are part of the ego's scheme for self-preservation. And it is these threats, as much as the fear of the unknown represented by miracle impulses, which incite the ego to self-inflating delusions of grandiosity. There is a very simple explanation for the single, common ego perception and response to both sources of threat. The ego is very simply a thought of attack, and so its only reaction to anything perceived to be outside itself--real or imaginary--must be to attack, either now or later (T- 9.VIII.3:4-6). The attack may be either direct (special hate) or indirect (special love), but attack is all that the ego is capable of. With special love, or where the balance of power seems overwhelmingly against it, the attack may be disguised, but the content is nevertheless nothing other than attack. And so the ego does not and cannot distinguish between the content of any thought that it attacks. Much as the Holy Spirit's judgment, seeing everything as either an extension of love or a call for love, responds only with love (T-12.I.3), so the ego, regardless of the nature of the content it encounters, sees everything only as a threat to its continued existence and responds only with hate and attack. So, to the ego, the enemy is both any right-minded thought that reflects the truth of who we are in our unlimitedness--the grandeur of our true Self--as well as any ego-based thought, including the body, which challenges or undermines the ego's imaginary \"autonomy\" and \"supremacy.\" Ironically, as already noted, the other ego thoughts it attacks are merely split off parts of itself, but the ego is capable of perceiving only threat from anything seen as outside itself (T-4.V.2,3). A third source of perceived threat, as you have observed, is the power of our mind to choose between those right-minded and wrong-minded thoughts for, as much as the ego may hate us, it is dependent on the power of our mind to choose it for its continued existence (T-6.IV.4:1-2; T- 7.VI.3). And so, we can say unequivocally that \"the ego is quite literally a fearful thought\" (T-5.V.3:7). So long as we remain identified with the ego, we can only vacillate between various forms of fear and attack, or suspiciousness and viciousness (T-9.VII.3:4-10). If we could look very honestly at all of our reactions to everything around us when we are in our wrong-mind, we would recognize that this is really the only content we are capable of experiencing as an ego. The insanity of the ego's defenses is most clearly seen in the self-inflation of its own grandiosity, which is always an attack on a made-up other as a defense against the ego's intrinsic sense of littleness and vulnerability. The other must be held responsible for the feelings of inadequacy, rather than seeing them simply as a result of our choice for the ego itself in the first place."

    "text_input": "Q #930: Some people are giving psychotherapy training based on A Course in Miracles. Is that really necessary or should I just stay with the Course itself?",
    "output": "People are free to do whatever they choose with the Course, either treating it as a total and complete thought system within itself--which it is--or attempting to combine it with whatever other teachings they are already familiar, whether they be alternative spiritual paths, self-help techniques, or various therapeutic models. Almost without exception, however, any attempt at integrating the Course with these other practices will involve some compromise of the Course's radical principle of nonduality, as people, often without consciously realizing what they are doing, end up bringing its profound teaching down to their own level of understanding and comfort. There certainly is nothing bad or \"sinful\" about these kinds of integrative efforts, but they will almost certainly dilute the Course's message and mix levels of teaching in an unhelpful way, confusing the student and reducing the value of both the Course and what it is being combined with. Confusion arises because the Course is never saying anything about behavior, and almost every other teaching at some level addresses the issue of how we are acting in the world and relating interpersonally with others. And the Course is simply not concerned with inter personal issues, except as they are a mirror of what is happening at an intra personal level, that is, with decisions being made at the level of mind, where the illusory experience of being a separate, individual person originates. Changes may in turn be reflected at an interpersonal level, but that would never be the Course's focus or concern. And so you will do well simply to direct your efforts at understanding and applying the forgiveness principles of the Course as it stands on its own, recognizing that its only purpose is to bring about a change in how you see, or interpret, the world, and not to change the world that you see. Other approaches, such as psychotherapy, may certainly also have value and serve a very useful purpose in your life. The only mistake would be to attempt to combine them with the Course's principles, rather than simply accepting their helpfulness at their own level."

    "text_input": "Q #931: I have a question about judgment. In your answer to #642, you state \"The Course does not ask us not to judge, but rather to recognize the judgments we do make, including the judgment against ourselves for judging.\" I understand the context in which you made this response, meaning that one should not beat oneself up or feel guilty when we succumb to judgment, as this just fuels the ego. However, I need some clarification about the first part of your response. It seems that A Course in Miracles specifically asks us not to judge in several places. In the manual for teachers it states: \"He must learn to lay all judgment aside, and ask only what he wants in every circumstance\" (M-4.I.A.7:8). Also in the manual is an essay on being non-judgmental, starting with the line: \"God's teachers do not judge\" (M-4.III.1:1). So my  question is: should I strive not to judge, or strive only to observe when I am judging? The answer is probably to try to do both. Can you provide any additional perspective on this issue?",
    "output": "The Course comes to us in the dream of separation from the part of the mind of the Sonship that is outside of the dream. The need for its curriculum of teaching us non-judgment rests on our decision to identify with the body and the world, having already \"judged\" that separation is preferable to oneness by choosing it. The answer you quote is correct in that we will not learn not to judge if we deny that we have judged already, and continue to make judgments about a multitude of things all through the day, every day. When Jesus says God's teachers do not judge, he is referring to the fact that the only activity of the split mind is choosing, not judging. The goal of the Course is to teach us that we are minds that choose, not bodies that judge. In fact, Jesus tells us we cannot judge: \"You have often been urged to refrain from judging, not because it is a right to be withheld from you. You cannot judge. You merely can believe the ego's judgments, all of which are false\" (W-pI.151.4:2-4, italics added). Thus, learning to \"lay all judgment aside\" means learning to see in the ego's judgments the reflection of the mind's choice for separation, instead of struggling with the judgments, or worse, believing they are true. Moreover, doing battle with the ego's judgments is a lost cause. The ego will always judge. The important thing is to be willing to recognize the judgments and the purpose they serve, and to remember that they are always false. Their only usefulness is in revealing the mind's choice for separation and the need for forgiveness. Rather than struggle with judgments, what we are asked to do is be vigilant for the ego's judgment in every situation with willingness to \"lay it aside\" by questioning it and remembering that there is another way of looking. In doing so, we make room for the Holy Spirit to reinterpret everything according to His perception. Everything then becomes a classroom to learn that the ego's judgment is not our only option. Moreover, it is wrong about everything. In this classroom, the teacher of God learns to choose between the ego and the Holy Spirit, rather than to judge. Awareness of judgment is the first step in the right direction, while striving not to judge short circuits the whole process. The ego presents itself in the form of judgment; the teacher of God departs from business as usual by seeing judgment as the reflection of the mind's choice with an opportunity to choose again. Thus, the teacher of God does not judge (M-4.III.1:1); he chooses."

There are many possibilities of how the voice Helen heard was not Jesus. I find it hard to understand why she would think it is Jesus. Could you kindly explain to me how it is the great savior who she was hearing? A: Helen knew this for certain. There was never any question in her mind about the identity of the voice she heard, as is chronicled in Kenneth's book Absence from Felicity, which presents a wealth of information about Helen and her scribing of the Course. There probably are very few people who have not wondered about the same thing, but many have found that it ceases to be an issue for them as they continue to practice the lessons and see the results in their lives.

    "text_input": "Q #933: I know that students are discouraged from mixing approaches, so I hope you will bear with me and see the sincerity of my question. It is this: Advaita Vedanta, also a nondualistic view, seems to insist that I have no choices; what will happen will happen at its appointed time, and in its appointed way. The \"goal\" of this view is the ultimate realization of choicelessness: seeing that there is no one to exercise choice. A Course in Miracles also seems to work towards this point, but it has as its chief practice the repeated exercising of the choice for forgiveness until we realize this choice was illusory, but by then it has done its job and delivered us to the gates of heaven, where, presumably, choicelessness is the rule. Is there a way these two views can be reconciled? Might it suggest that forgiveness is not within my power, and will happen when it happens? If so, then what are the implications for the Course student? Are we possibly merely witnesses to awakening, rather than doers of any kind? A: The Course is written on two levels, as has been discussed elsewhere in these questions (e.g., Questions #3, #291, #612, #710, #782i): the level of nondualistic truth, where only Love is true and nothing else is real, and a second dualistic level, where the perception of the Holy Spirit, while illusory, is true (a reflection of truth), and the perception of the ego, based on belief in sin, guilt and fear, is false. This makes the Course unique among the world's spiritual paths for, while coming from the highest level, like the Advaita teachings, it nevertheless acknowledges what we mistakenly believe to be true and provides a framework for using the ego's symbols of sin and attack and guilt--illusory but nevertheless very real in our experience--for a different purpose (e.g., T-14.VII.5; T-24.IV.3). This allows us to lessen our experience of sin, guilt and fear while we still remain identified with the dualistic thought system of the ego--making the Course a very compassionate teaching indeed. For while all of our suffering is illusory, the fact is to us it still seems very real. And so a teaching that can help us to minimize the pain while we continue to believe that we have some choice over our experience--at the same time pointing us to something beyond these false beliefs--can be much more helpful than simply insisting to ourselves that it is not real. A possible danger for many students of a practice such as the Advaita Vedanta--and this is an error made by many students of the Course as well, who fail to make the distinction between the two levels of the Course--is that it can lead to denial of what we are experiencing because it is not real, pushing our conscious feelings and beliefs out of awareness and simply prolonging in time--unreal as time ultimately may be--our experience of duality (T-26.V.2). Now in the end, we will recognize that the power of choice must be meaningless (e.g., T-5.II.6:4; T-27.III.7), if the options are Everything and nothing. And the outcome is inevitable, so that if we were to deny the reality of any choice and simply witness all the events we have \"chosen\" on another level to experience, the time will come when time will cease (T-29.VI). But even simply witnessing events represents a choice from our current level of experience. And accepting the role of the unbiased witness who observes without judging is in fact what the Course means by forgiveness--for there is nothing to be done, only undone--we are not doers in the forgiveness process, which happens in the mind outside of time and space. In Jesus' words, \"Forgiveness ... is still, and quietly does nothing. It offends no aspect of reality, nor seeks to twist it to appearances it likes. It merely looks, and waits, and judges not\" (W-pII.1:4:1-3). The only meaningful choice while we believe choice is possible is how to view the events we are witnessing--either with or without judgment. Judgment always reflects a dualistic perspective, where there is both a good and a bad outcome, or a desirable and an undesirable one. Simply",
    "output": "observing without judgment reflects nondualistic reality. And so the choice to forgive that the Course is holding out to us is none other than the choice to see ourselves as the witness--the mind--rather than as the doer--the body in the world. In that sense, despite using different words which seem to point to different practices, the Course and Advaita are really saying the same thing."

    "text_input": "Q #934: To learn A Course in Miracles, a student needs to form a relationship in his mind with Jesus or the Holy Spirit. The Course tells us this repeatedly. But it offers hardly any practical advice about how to contact them. Helen Schucman, the scribe of the Course, clearly had a personal relationship with Jesus. She knew how to commune with him. But what do the rest of us do?",
    "output": "Undoubtedly, many students of A Course in Miracles have at some point envied Helen's experience of hearing Jesus' voice. It is easy to feel that Jesus must have had a special love for Helen that he is withholding from the rest of us. This is exactly what the ego would like us to think because it justifies its claim that we did not abandon God's Love; God's Love abandoned us. But believing that Helen had something we do not because we cannot literally hear a voice misses the Course's entire point. It is not the words Jesus gave Helen that we need in our own mind; it is the love that inspired them. It is not Jesus as an historical, human figure, nor the Holy Spirit as an Entity whom we need; it is the abstract love they represent. The Course tells us that the body is but a figure in a dream (T-27.VIII.4:3). That means every body--including Jesus, the Holy Spirit, and ourselves as the individuals we think we are. Anything we perceive as having an individual identity and physical existence is but a symbol in our dream. But because we are so completely convinced of the reality of our symbols, a book that only spoke of abstract love without personalizing it would not be of much help to us. We have no way to grasp abstract love on the level of human thought. So, when that abstract love that comes from outside of this dream entered Helen's mind, she experienced it as the voice of Jesus--a potent symbol for her. Fortunately, Jesus is a potent symbol for most of the rest of us in the Western world too. So, the happy result is a book that gives us a way within the dream of conceptualizing the love that comes from outside it. As students of the Course, we should note that we have probably never told ourselves that we cannot follow the dictates of the ego because we do not hear its voice. On one level, we know that the ego is just a symbol. Yet, when the Course talks of the ego's \"senseless shrieks\" (T- 25.V.3:5) we do not protest that we have never heard them. Rather, we feel an at times painful sense of recognition. And so we accept the ego as a useful symbol, both real and unreal. However, when the Course tells us the Holy Spirit is \"a still small Voice\" (T-21.V.1:6), we think we need to literally hear a voice. And there is a reason we instantly decide that. On a level we are not aware of, we do know that this Voice of Love is really a thought of love that still remains within our mind. We also know (again, unconsciously) that we could turn to it at any time and that terrifies us. So, in the blink of an eye, the part of our mind that is afraid (symbolized by the ego) finds this clever setup that will once again allow us to seek but never find. Because we are so skilled at keeping ourselves firmly rooted in this dynamic and in this dream, it is very helpful to have the image of an older, wiser, gentle, and loving brother as our guide. But again, it is only in our mind that we need him. He is not coming to us. Rather, we are symbolically coming to him by making a choice for a different thought system. Furthermore, we do not even need to look for this thought system. As the Course says, \"Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all of the barriers within yourself that you have built against it\" (T-16.IV.6:1). And so, all we have to do is watch our unloving thoughts and actions without justifying or judging them. Ultimately, this will teach us that our pain is self- inflicted and that we would be much happier if we made a different choice. This is what it means to reach for Jesus' hand to transcend the ego (T-8.V.6:8). To do this requires no special attributes or abilities--only a little willingness (T-18.V.2:5). For related discussions about listening to Jesus and the Holy Spirit, please see Questions #11, and #401(i)."

    "text_input": "Q #935: How do we choose or end up with the life we appear to lead?",
    "output": "A Course in Miracles does a brilliant job explaining why we ended up with the experience we seem to be having. But it really does not provide an intellectually satisfying answer as to how this happened. This is because there is no intellectually satisfying answer to that question. The Course tells us that our entire physical existence is an illusion--a dream. So, it is helpful to think about how we would work with an upsetting night-time dream. We would not ask how it happened. Instead, we would examine the content of the dream and ask ourselves why it would be in our mind and what we might learn from it. This is exactly the process the Course asks us to undertake with our entire life. Though we obviously do not yet believe life is merely a dream (and certainly should not pretend that we do), we must work with it as if it were. Fortunately, the Course makes doing this relatively easy by letting us know that all of us wrote the scripts of our lives to serve one simple purpose: to maintain our individuality but get rid of our guilt. Every aspect of ourselves, every experience we have, and every person, creature, or object we encounter, is a symbol we made up to validate our declaration that \"I am here but it is not my fault!\" Jesus tells us in the Course that all this began with the tiny, mad idea that we could be separate from God (T-27.VIII.6:2). Up to that point, we were one with our Creator. But this thought filled us with both glee and guilt. The ego told us we could keep the glee and lose the guilt if we would just listen to it and forget everything else. We took the ego up on its offer, which led us to fall asleep, seem to shatter into a billion fragments, and wind up in this world of form. Course students invariably ask, \"But how could that happen?\" And again, there is no intellectually satisfying answer because it did not really happen. The very fact that we think there is a me who needs to understand something is the barrier that makes understanding impossible. This is why Jesus makes statements like, \"This course will lead to knowledge, but knowledge itself is still beyond the scope of our curriculum. Nor is there any need for us to try to speak of what must forever lie beyond words\" (T-18.IX.11:1-2). So, clearly, we cannot know how we chose the scripts that make up our individual lives. From our limited perspective, we cannot understand what determined our specific choices for families, genders, and so forth. But what we can know essentially makes such concerns irrelevant. We can be sure that while the forms in our scripts differ, the content for all of us is the same--again, to prove that we exist as individuals but that it is someone else's fault. Returning to the image of fragmenting into a billion pieces, we can think of ourselves as fragments of a mirror. Each of us is capable of reflecting either the ego or the Holy Spirit (in other words, God's Love). We are used to reflecting the ego and letting our lives serve its goal of separation. But we could instead reflect the Holy Spirit, Who will turn our lives into classrooms for remembering that we all share the same need--the need to know that God is not angry with us and that it is safe to awaken and be at peace at last. In every moment, we make a choice between these two options. We are always holding either the ego's hand or the Holy Spirit's. Within this dream, which hand we choose determines what our lives will be like. Therefore, this is the only choice we need to understand how to make now. And so Jesus tells us: \"The emphasis of this course always remains the same;--it is at this moment that complete salvation is offered you, and it is at this moment that you can accept it. This is still your one responsibility. Atonement might be equated with total escape from the past and total lack of interest in the future. Heaven is here. There is nowhere else. Heaven is now. There is no other time\" (M-24.6:1-7)."

He stated, \"It's very cut-and-dried, the Jews were warriors and never promoted peace, love, and brotherhood. That all started with Jesus.\" I am dumbfounded by his view and know he is hugely misinformed. Are his statements representative of Unity Church? Is this what the Course teaches?",
    "output": "While we are not affiliated with Unity Church and therefore certainly not experts on it, in our experience, the attitudes you have described are in no way representative of its teachings. As for A Course in Miracles, its central purpose is to help us undo our faulty belief that some of us are more capable and worthy of love than others. It seeks to help us realize that we all play the same game. We tell ourselves that another person or group is the guilty one, but this is a cover for our hidden belief that the guilt is in us. Deep down, each of us knows we play this game. And the only way we could know we are playing it (and indeed play it at all) is by having two opposing thought systems in our mind. These are the thought systems of the ego and the Holy Spirit. The ego is a thought system of 100 percent hate. It seeks to maintain our individuality and existence no matter whom it has to attack in the process. Its motto is \"kill or be killed\" (M- 17.7:11). This does not usually look like physical murder. It more often looks like judgment-- the ongoing murderous condemnation in our minds of our fellow human beings. In terms of our own spiritual growth, we need to know that it makes no difference whether we are condemning an entire race of people or the individual who just cut us off on the freeway. When we make a judgment about a person or a group that we would not apply to the whole Sonship, we are reinforcing our own guilt and self-hatred. We are ensuring that we remain asleep with our belief in this painful world of separation and death intact. This is true no matter how justified our judgments might seem. This does not mean we should not recognize unkind behavior, or, for example, hold criminals accountable for their actions. It simply means that we should do so without hate. It also does not mean that we should deny or suppress our less than loving thoughts. Rather, the Course asks us to become more and more honest about them. By actually looking at them, we can finally stop projecting them and begin to take them less seriously. Jesus sums up the entire process of being a Course student in this one simple statement: \"All that is needed is you look upon the problem as it is, and not the way that you have set it up\" (T- 27.VII.2:2). Our eyes will always tell us that we have many problems in this world and the source of them is outside of us. But we set up a world, a body, and a brain to convince us that this is so. We can only move beyond our pain by saying to ourselves, \"maybe I am wrong.\" The process for doing this is to turn to the Holy Spirit in our mind and ask Him to help us look at all our judgment, anger, and hatred honestly and without guilt. The Holy Spirit is our memory of God's Love. The Course teaches that we are still at home in Heaven, joined with our Creator. But we had a tiny, mad idea that we could be separate. This idea provoked guilt, which caused us to fear retribution from an angry God. To escape from that, we fell asleep and dreamt up this world. And so our goal from the beginning was to make a world in which we would see the lack of love in everyone but ourselves. And yet, despite this goal, we retain the memory of God's Love in our mind. At any moment we can turn away from the ego and toward the Holy Spirit. He will tell us that \"The problem of separation, which is really the only problem, has already been solved\" (W-pI.79.1:4). It has already been solved because it does not actually exist. The problem is only in our mind and so is the solution. This same dynamic--the conflict producing coexistence of the ego's and the Holy Spirit's mutually exclusive thought systems--has existed in the mind of virtually every human being who ever appeared to live in this world: Jew or Christian, Muslim or atheist. Jesus is the Western world's most potent example of one who chose to hear only the Holy Spirit's Voice. But the choice he made is available to all of us. Our job therefore is to make that choice. Whether others have made it is not our concern (and in fact, there is no way for us to know since we cannot know what is going on inside another person's mind). If we find ourselves trying to make determinations about how spiritually advanced another is, we can be sure it is simply a tactic of our ego--brought on by our own fear--to keep God's Love away from us. And when we get caught up in all of this silliness, the Course can help us return to sanity by reminding us that \"You do not believe the Son of God is guiltless because you see the past, and see him not. When you condemn a brother you are saying, 'I who was guilty choose to remain so.' You have denied his freedom, and by so doing you have denied the witness unto yours. You could as easily have freed him from the past, and lifted from his mind the cloud of guilt that binds him to it. And in his freedom would have been your own\" (T-13.IX.4:3-7)."

    "text_input": "Q #937: I keep coming across the idea of shared interests (as opposed to separate interests). Could you explain what this means and give examples?",
    "output": "First, let's start with separate interests. A Course in Miracles lets us know that because God is perfect Oneness, if we believe in the reality of our individual, physical existence, we must believe that we destroyed both God and Heaven. Convinced that we are bodies and are cut off from God's Love, we are filled with physical and psychological needs. These needs compel us to get them met no matter what. In this state of mind, we can hardly care about other people--they only matter to us to the extent that they meet our needs. This is what it means to have separate interests, and it is the mindset in which most of us spend nearly all our time. Anytime we feel angry (or even slightly irritated) with anyone, it is a reflection of this mindset. In truth, we only get upset with another when we believe he or she has failed to meet one of our needs. It is easy to come up with examples to illustrate this. The tricky part about giving examples when it comes to the Course is that the Course is never about behavior. Rather, it is a guide to help us change our mind. The Course tells us that in every moment, we are always listening to one of two internal teachers--the ego or the Holy Spirit. Of course, which teacher we listen to will be reflected in our behavior and experiences. But what this looks like is not up to us to decide. With that caveat, let's consider an example. Imagine you get into your car in the morning to go to work. You have a particularly important meeting to get to and know that even if traffic is light, you will just barely arrive in time. You start your car and notice that it is almost completely out of gas. You realize that your partner used it the day before, did not fill the tank, and forgot to tell you it was empty. Now you will definitely be late to your meeting. In the above situation, you could listen to the ego--again, as most of us do nearly all the time. The ego always begins with the premise that we are guilty and deserving of punishment because we exist at God's expense. But it does not want us to become aware that we believe this about ourselves because if we did, we might begin to question it. And that would spell the beginning of the end of any power our ego has (not to mention our individual identity as we have come to define it). So the ego tells us that our problems are in the world rather than in our mind, and that something or someone else is to blame for them. In the scenario just described, the ego would tell you that terrible things are likely to happen if you are late to your meeting and that it is your partner's fault. You would probably be filled with anger and anxiety. You might have the desire to let your partner know what a terrible, selfish thing he or she has done. Certainly in that moment, you would not feel like being loving or kind. On the other hand, you could listen to the Voice of the Holy Spirit. He would remind you that God's Love is real, has not been destroyed, and is totally unaffected by whatever happens with your meeting. He would tell you that you are perfectly safe because your reality is outside of this world of lack and separation. Further, He would inform you that your only need is to awaken from this painful dream by realizing that this is true. And then it would dawn on you that if this were true for you, it would have to be true for everyone. This is what the Course means by shared interests--the recognition that the one and only need every single one of us has is the need to realize that this world is just a bad dream, and that we are still safe at home in Heaven, enveloped in God's Love. Recognizing this, you would have no desire to make your partner (or anyone) feel guilty, and all your anger would disappear. The only thing you could possibly want for him or her is to awaken along with you. Again, this could play out in many different ways in terms of behavior. You may very well let your partner know that in the future, you want him or her to handle things differently. But you would do so knowing you have not been hurt and thus with no desire to be hurtful. Basically, when we think anything in this world has the power to give us peace or take our peace away, we believe in separate interests. When we know that peace and true happiness come from God and are always available to us, we will automatically shift to a belief in shared interests. Then we will know that everything we perceive is either an expression of love or a call for it. And it will become impossible for us to express anything but love to others or to ourselves."

    "text_input": "Q #938: I am finding it extremely difficult to deal with the sudden death of my child. I know that death is an illusion, but there seems to be no end to my feelings of anguish and grief. Are there any words from A Course in Miracles that are helpful in such a situation? And why would God allow such a meaningless and horrific event to take place? A: If you are comfortable thinking of death as part of the illusion, perhaps you would find it helpful to dwell on its purpose and importance in the ego thought system, which might then help you better understand your anguish and grief. The section in the manual for teachers, \"What Is Death?\" (M-27), describes death as \"the central dream from which all illusions stem\" (M- 27.1:1), and adds that it is not God's Will: \"He did not make death because He did not make fear. Both are equally meaningless to Him\" (M-27.4:9-10). Death, thus, is rooted in the thought system of separation, which has nothing to do with God, meaning that God does not \"allow\" death. Letting go of the belief in the reality of death and that God is ultimately responsible for it is not at all easy, because as Jesus explains in that section, \"Without the idea of death there is no world. All dreams will end with this one. This is salvation's goal; the end of all illusions\" (M- 27.6:3-5). Deep within our minds we know that if we let go of this belief in death, the foundation of our very existence as individuals will be undermined, and that fear is the huge obstacle that stands in the way of our letting go. We are not conscious of this, of course, but that is why it is so hard to get over grief. Once we grasp the truth that Jesus teaches us, we then must spend the rest of our lives processing it and applying it to the specifics of our daily lives. As we discussed in #15, this must be done with gentleness and patience, respecting the depth of our feelings, and never denying them in our attempt to be \"good students\" of this course.",
    "output": "Another aspect to consider: The sudden death of a child is almost always thought of as a tragedy, with no other description even conceivable to most people. Yet, within the thought system of A Course in Miracles that is a judgment that assumes an understanding of both the child's and the parents' Atonement scripts. But we really do not know what our own or anyone else's full path involves. And so we must consider the possibility that this event has been chosen by the mind of the child as part of its Atonement lessons. As the parent, then, you might ask for help to see it the same way--not as a lesson sent by God or the Holy Spirit, but as part of your script that the Holy Spirit can help you use to gently learn that loss and grief are connected with the ego's image of you and your child, and do not come from your true Self-image as God's creation (W-pII.284). Finally, in a section called \"False versus True Healing,\" The Song of Prayer offers a comforting view of death as a healing alternative to the way the world usually regards it (S-3.II)."

    "text_input": "Q #939: A Course in Miracles says that physical medications are forms of spells. Would you explain what this means? Didn't God say he gave us everything we need, including the herbs to make medications?",
    "output": "While the Bible and our Western religions are based on the premise that God created the world and everything in it, A Course in Miracles is not. According to the Course, the world is \"false perception\" (W-pII.3.1:1), was \"made as an attack on God\" (W-pII.3.2:1), and \"meant to be a place where God could enter not, and where His Son could be apart from Him\" (W- pII.3.2:4). Nothing in this physical world could have come from God because He is perfect oneness while this is a world of separation and multiplicity. So clearly, God is not in this world and does not even know about it. This entire world, our individual identity, our body, and all of our problems, only exist in our mind. We made all of this up precisely to keep the Love of God away. We made up everything that seems to help us or give us pleasure for the same reason. In one sense, whenever we seem to be helped by something external, we are telling God that we do not need His Love because we found something better. This is what the Course calls magic-- the attempt to solve problems externally by changing something in the physical world. We practice this type of magic virtually all the time. When we feel upset by people's words or actions, we want to change them. When we have physical discomfort, we treat the body. The trouble with this approach is that it can never lead us to a lasting state of peace. If we do manage to get someone else to change, there will always be another person who upsets us. If we take a pill for our headache, sooner or later another part of our body will act up. Jesus gave us his course to help us realize that our attempts at magic do not yield lasting or satisfying results because they do not address our one real problem--the guilt provoking belief that we separated from God and destroyed His Love. The Course informs us that this self- accusation is false and urges us to make our reawakening to the peace of God our singular goal. The method it lays out for doing so involves changing internal teachers. This is the Course's definition of a miracle--the shift in perception from the ego's thought system of sin, guilt, and fear, to the Holy Spirit's thought system of forgiveness. When we are willing to ask for this shift again and again, we will be led through a gentle process of awakening in which we ultimately realize that all our problems are made up and have no power to take away our peace or happiness. Our choice in any seemingly problematic situation is very simple. We can attempt magic by trying to change the outward picture of our life. Or, we can choose the miracle by asking for help to change the inner condition (our thinking) that lead us to view the picture as a problem. The passage your question refers to states, \"Magic is the mindless or the miscreative use of mind. Physical medications are forms of 'spells,' but if you are afraid to use the mind to heal, you should not attempt to do so\" (T-2.V.2: 1-2). In other words, because we still fear God's Love and the power of our own mind, there are times when choosing magic is the best we can do. Jesus wants us to know that this is okay. While it will not give us what we truly want, using magic is not bad, evil, or sinful. So if you have a physical problem and believe that a medication will help you, you should take it and not feel guilty. The medication will not bring you closer to the peace of God. But we can get closer to that peace by taking our medicine with a gentle smile that says, \"I'm scared right now and that's all right.\""

    "text_input": "Q #940: I just started reading and studying A Course in Miracles and my question is: Do I understand correctly that Jesus dictated the book? I've had problems accepting Jesus, for the way I have been taught, and the importance given to the fact of his crucifixion to free us from all our sins. It just didn't sound right to me. Now I'm baffled watching me accept this wonderful opportunity to join this brother offering me a hand so openly to walk the walk to God. A: Yes and no. In Kenneth Wapnick's book, Absence from Felicity: The Story of Helen Schucman and Her Scribing of \"A Course in Miracles,\" he relates that the voice Helen heard dictate the Course identified itself as Jesus. Thus, Helen's experience in form was that she heard Jesus' voice dictating the Course. Like all of us, Helen had a split mind, part of which identified with the ego (wrong mind), while the other part held the shining light of the memory of God's Love (right mind). The nature of a split mind is such that one part of the mind dissociates from the other. So when the mind chooses to identify with the ego, it cannot recognize the right mind as part of itself. It was too fearful for Helen, as it is for most of us, to identify fully with the right mind, shared by all the Sonship, which is the source of the Course's loving message of forgiveness. However, she was able to receive the message as long as she perceived its source as the symbolic figure of Jesus, who had been an important figure for her throughout her life. He is also a significant figure for the western world, Christian and non-Christian alike, and since one of the goals of the Course is to correct the distorted teachings of traditional Christianity, it is important that Jesus be the identified source of the Course. Although \"Some bitter idols have been made of him who would be only brother to the world\" (C-5.5:7) and we must learn to forgive him our illusions of him (C-5.5:8), his authority as \"spokesperson\" of the Course's loving message of forgiveness is readily recognized. The authorship of the Course, therefore, can be seen as trinitarian: Helen's right mind, the right mind of the Sonship, and Jesus as the symbolic figure representing both. Its content, that the world is an illusion, the separation never happened, and God's innocent Son is at home with Him in Heaven, is beyond any form including the Course itself. Helen Schucman and William Thetford's joint decision to find a better way to relate to each other and to their colleagues",
    "output": "reflected their choice to accept the content of the right mind. This decision found expression in the form of the Course. Belief in the crucifixion of the historical Jesus is not a requirement for the study of the Course. In fact, the traditional Christian teaching that Jesus' crucifixion atoned for Adam and Eve's sin and reopened the gates of Heaven for everyone is presented in the Course as one of Christianity's mistaken beliefs in need of correction. Every basic principle of the Course refutes the teaching that Jesus died for our sins; e.g., there is no sin (T-26.VII.10:5), no guilt (T-14.V.1:12), no world (W-pI.132.6:2), no death (T-3.VII.5:11), no separation (T-8.V.2:8). Jesus is not the savior of the world; rather, salvation is accepted when the mind that mistakenly chose to identify with the ego (wrong mind), chooses instead to identify with the memory of God's Love (right mind), symbolized by the Holy Spirit and Jesus. Helen's fear of identifying fully with her right mind is everyone's fear. Thus, while we remain dissociated from our true selves, we need a symbolic figure such as Jesus, who dictates the Course and whose hand we hold in the process of learning we are one with him. Jesus himself encourages us to do so: \"If it helps you, think of me holding your hand and leading you. And I assure you this will be no idle fantasy\" (W-pI.70.9:3-4). Remembering that Jesus is the name we give to one who represents the right mind of the Sonship, and comes to us from outside the dream in a form that we can relate to, will help keep him real to you without being baffled."

    "text_input": "Q #941: Please explain the Holy Spirit, specifics, and A Course in Miracles' ultimate goal.",
    "output": "Jesus tells us in the Course that the Holy Spirit \"is the Christ Mind which is aware of the knowledge that lies beyond perception\" (T-5.I.5:1) and \"is in your right mind, as He was in mine\" (T-5.I.3:3). In other words, the Holy Spirit is the memory of God's Love that remained in our mind when we fell asleep and dreamt up this world of separation. We can think of Him as an internal Teacher to whom we can turn for guidance. He will correct our painful thoughts of separation with forgiving thoughts, which reflect the truth that we are still \"home in God, dreaming of exile but perfectly capable of awakening to reality\" (T-10.I.2: 1). Of specifics, the Course says, \"The Holy Spirit will answer every specific problem as long as you believe that problems are specific\" (T-11.VIII.5:5). Then it goes on to tell us that \"Problems are not specific but they take specific forms, and these specific shapes make up the world\" (T- 27.V.8:1). So, the Course lets us know that there is a loving presence to which we can turn for help with the specific challenges we seem to face in our lives. At the same time, it sets out a curriculum that will lead us to realize that the multitude of specific problems we think we have are just reflections of our one real problem--our belief that we exist at God's expense and deserve to be punished for it. Jesus wants us to use the specific problems in our lives as classrooms that will ultimately help us to awaken. The first step in this process is to bring our problems to the light of the Holy Spirit in our mind so He can reinterpret them for us in a loving way. This will not necessarily change a problem on the level of form, but it will take away all our pain and conflict about it. Over time, all our specifics will begin to seem more and more alike and we will automatically stop asking the Holy Spirit for help with our specific problems and instead ask Him to help us (to paraphrase the Course) change our mind about our problems. This brings us to the Course's ultimate goal. The rather ambitious goal of the Course is to teach us that this world is nothing more than an \"outside picture of an inward condition\" (T-21.in.1: 5), that this condition is making us miserable, and that--with the Holy Spirit's help--we have the ability to change it. The Course would have changing this inward condition become the central focus of our lives. We could think of studying this Course as taking the initial step on a lifelong journey of forgiveness and ever-increasing self-awareness. As Course students, it is important to remember that \"This course is a beginning, not an end\" (W-ep.1:1). The end of the journey--the real world--will be when we, like Jesus, have nothing but the Holy Spirit in our mind. Happily, when that happens and what it looks like is not our concern."

    "text_input": "Q #942: I don't understand how A Course in Miracles views the use of personal effort in advancing oneself or in helping others. Is making an effort to do anything worthwhile in terms of the Course? For instance, I do volunteer work with children. Is this worth doing? What about donating money to help others who have less than I do? Is doing so just a reflection of my guilt? How about getting an education? According to the Course, is this just my ego trying to better itself and bring accolades and a bigger salary? Finally, what about exercising and living a healthy lifestyle? By my understanding of the Course, attempts to improve physical health only reaffirm an attachment to the ego. So why bother trying? A: Undoubtedly, many students of A Course in Miracles have asked themselves those questions. But it is important to remember that the Course is not a guide for behavior. It is only concerned with motivating us to exchange the ego for the Holy Spirit as our internal Teacher. This is why Jesus never says anything in the Course about what we should do. Rather he tells us to ask of everything, \"What is the purpose?\" (T-4.V.6:9). He also tells us that we give everything we see all the meaning that it has for us (W-pI.2). In other words, nothing here has any inherent meaning--things mean whatever they symbolize in our mind. Now, it is true that we initially fell asleep and dreamt up this world because we listened to the ego. So on one hand, everything here is a symbol of our apparent separation and triumph over God. On the other hand, now that we are having this dream, we can choose to reinterpret it with the Holy Spirit as our Guide. When we do that, everything becomes a symbol of forgiveness, helping us to get closer and closer to reawakening to God's Love. That is what the Course urges us to do--use this world as a classroom in forgiveness until we do not need it anymore.",
    "output": "It is very helpful to realize that the Course is written on two levels. On level one--the level of absolute truth--this world is a dream. But on level two--within the dream, where we all believe ourselves to be--this world can either be a prison or a classroom. And so Jesus does not want us to pretend we think this world is an illusion. Rather he advises us to \"Use all the little names and symbols which delineate the world of darkness. Yet accept them not as your reality\" (W- pI.184.11:1-2). That means we should keep doing everything so called normal people do, but do so with a different purpose. Were we to stop all activities that we judge as wrong minded, we would be denying the Holy Spirit the only arena He has for correcting our thinking. And so again, we do not change what we do, only how we think about what we do. You asked whether giving money to others and getting an education are worth doing from a Course perspective. The answer is: From a Course perspective, extending love is worth doing, while projecting guilt is not. Whether or not you should engage in a specific activity depends upon what it symbolizes to you. This is why Jesus says \"The curriculum is highly individualized\" (M-29.2:6). If you suspect you are drawn to doing something for the wrong reasons that is the perfect time to simply ask the Holy Spirit to look at it with you. He will bring love to the situation and then you will know what to do. You also asked if attempts to improve the body reaffirm an attachment to the ego. The Course informs us that the \"body is a wholly neutral thing\" (W-pII.294) and that to deny its existence is to engage in \"a particularly unworthy form of denial\" (T-2.IV.3:11). Clearly, Jesus does not want us to stop caring for the body as a path to letting go of the ego. This is because denying the body is merely the flip side of indulging it. As long as we are identified with the body, we should simply give it the care and attention it requires while asking for help to recognize that it does not have the power to affect our mind. The fact that you are wondering, \"why bother trying,\" makes it seem likely that you have fallen into one of the ego's classic traps. We adopted the ego as our guide because it convinced us that to do otherwise would destroy us. Then along comes the Course telling us we would be much better off if we chose the Holy Spirit as our internal Teacher. The ego knows that if we believed that message, its gig would be up. So it sends out a warning signal telling us, \"If you accept Jesus' message of love and forgiveness, you will lose!\" It does not tell us that we will lose only our pain and guilt, and that we will gain the lasting inner peace and true happiness we have always wanted. When you feel a gnawing sense of loss or despair in relation to being a Course student, it is because the ego slithered its way into becoming your study partner. Rest assured, our journey back to Heaven and into God's Loving Arms is not predicated on sacrifice. And neither Jesus nor the Holy Spirit will ever make us give up anything we really want."

    "text_input": "Q #943: I notice that when I practice the Course, my life seems to get worse. I realize that \"things seem as though they are being taken away from us,\" and I do feel that this is happening because of A Course in Miracles. Ken has often said it's like the ego telling us that if we continue down this path, we will be destroyed. And yet, we must work through our fear. I know that in psychotherapy things often seem to get worse before they get better; and I know you say this course is gentle, but that is not my experience, and it seems very insulting. Again, I believe this is the process. A: The feeling that things are being taken away is a common feeling among Course students, and it stems in part from our confusion about who we are and what truly belongs to us--\"I do not perceive my own best interests\" (W-pI.24). We have chosen (a choice we immediately concealed from our awareness) to take on a false identity as individuals in order to have the specialness we thought we could not have in our true Identity as God's one Son in Heaven. A Course in Miracles thus is helping us reverse this insanity of maintaining a false identity; but since it has become our identity and we no longer know of any other, we will go through a stage in the correction process of feeling as if something valuable is being taken from us--it is like an identity crisis:",
    "output": "\"Now must the Holy Spirit find a way to help you see this concept of the self must be undone, if any peace of mind is to be given you. Nor can it be unlearned except by lessons aimed to teach that you are something else. For otherwise, you would be asked to make exchange of what you now believe for total loss of self, and greater terror would arise in you. Thus are the Holy Spirit's lesson plans arranged in easy steps, that though there be some lack of ease at times and some distress, there is no shattering of what was learned, but just a retranslation of what seems to be the evidence on its behalf\" (T-31.V.8:3-5; 9:1). This process is really only about shifting the purpose of everything you do; it is not about behavior--ending relationships or getting rid of material possessions. It is about going through daily life now with Jesus or the Holy Spirit as your Teacher, so that you will use your life in the world to teach you that you are not a limited, vulnerable body, and that everyone else is joined with you on the journey and learning the same lessons. That will lead to peace and joy as you realize that following the ego has cost you true peace and joy. Thus, what we lose by following the Course's path is guilt, anxiety, fear, loneliness, hatred, etc.--all the effects of separation. And the conflict we feel will lessen, because we will have a unified purpose, in accord with our true nature. This sometimes can be difficult, for our fear is: Who would I be if I never felt guilty or fearful ever again? We made a secret vow to be faithful to the ego, and so if we are not aware of that, we will experience tremendous conflict in practicing the Course's principles--we will be fighting against ourselves, basically. Trust therefore is essential as we proceed--that we are being led out of desolation and into abiding peace. In the manual for teachers, Jesus outlines six stages in the development of trust (M-4.I.A), and the experiences you have related correspond to the first three. The process continues from there, and ends in a state of real peace, where we realize \"in glad astonishment, that for all this [we] gave up nothing!\" (T-16.VI.11:4). This process is rarely pain-free, but only because of our concealed commitment to the ego, and our fear that we will be nothing without it. Jesus understands this and encourages us accordingly: \" ... you believe that without the ego, all would be chaos. Yet I assure you that without the ego, all would be love\" (T- 15.V.1:7). Once you realize that all this course is doing is helping us all let go of what has brought us only pain--because of the mistaken choice we made in our minds--it would be hard not to feel grateful. And we find assurances from Jesus all along the way: \"How light and easy is the step across the narrow boundaries of the world of fear when you have recognized Whose hand you hold! Within your hand is everything you need to walk with perfect confidence away from fear forever ... \" (T-30.V.8:1-2). Finally, in the Index to Topics there is a category called Process/Progress, which you might wish to look at--we have responded to other students having similar concerns. Also in the Index, under A Course in Miracles, there is a category called Study and Practice of, and under that is the topic \"practice is causing fear and discomfort.\""

Since then I have found myself in a deep depression which has been so intense I have had to put away the Course until I am more stable.  Unfortunately, my family is currently in crisis. My eldest sister is suicidal and far more entrenched in depression than I am. She is living with my parents, getting a divorce, has no income, and has lost custody of her kids. At the same time, my father recently had a stroke and is being hospitalized.  About a month ago, I was at my parents' house when my sister made another suicide attempt. I was the one who pulled the plastic bag off her head. I realized that this incident with my sister that day only weakened my own mental state--and I went home virtually unable to leave my bed. Since then I decided it was urgent to stay clear of anxiety-provoking situations in order to build my strength up and pull out of this depression. This means I have not paid a visit to the hospital to see my father or taken calls from my mother regarding issues around my sister or father. Right now, as I write this, the phone keeps ringing. The first call was my sister asking desperately for my help; the second is my mother. I hear the call for help, but I know it is not in my interest to answer it. I feel guilt, anger, and powerlessness. My mental clarity is not all that it should be. Can you please help me with how to approach this situation given the principles of the Course.",
    "output": "Given all the difficult situations you are presently dealing with, it's not surprising that you're feeling guilty, angry, and powerless. Few people in your situation would be feeling any differently. Good for you for recognizing your feelings and being honest about them. Getting us to look at what's really going on inside ourselves and to be honest about the ego is one of the fundamental goals of A Course in Miracles. Only by being honest about the ego can we get past it to the truth. Putting the Course away until you feel more stable sounds like a good decision. Right now you need to do whatever you feel will support you through your depression and family crises. Please remember that from Jesus' perspective, it doesn't matter whether you derive comfort from studying his course, talking to a therapist, watching a sunset, or taking a pill. So seek whatever help you need to get through this difficult time. The main message of the Course is that we are not guilty. We just mistakenly think that we are, and have made up a world that seems to reinforce this belief. One of the ways our made up world does this is by constantly providing us with difficult situations that tempt us to feel guilty and miserable. Ultimately, the Course would have us recognize that our guilt and misery are just defenses that keep us from the Love of God, which is also in our mind. Many of us studying the Course however, get caught by inadvertently using it to reinforce our guilt. First we learn that we made up this world and scripted all the events in our lives (though we did this on the level of the mind of God's one Son who fell asleep, not as the individual whom we now seem to be). Then we begin to feel guilty about feeling guilty, or having special relationships, or judging family members when we should be \"hearing their call for love.\" This is a cruel thing to do to ourselves and is the last thing Jesus would want. He knows that if we were able to not judge, have holy relationships, and only perceive love in our brothers, we wouldn't be here. He seeks only to help us remember that all the painful situations we encounter here can serve to teach us that there is another way (and ultimately to remind us that in fact, we are not the individual--separate, lonely, and scared--with whom we have become fully identified). All we really need to do to apply the Course to any situation we're in is to continue doing what we do, but ask Jesus or the Holy Spirit in our mind to help us watch ourselves as we do it. That means letting ourselves be crazy, angry, sad, and so forth and neither judging nor justifying what we feel and do. If we are able to do this, ultimately, we will see our own underlying fear and call for love. And we'll feel the compassion of the loving presence in our mind that isn't judging us. Filled with that love, we'll be able to ask the Holy Spirit what is the loving response to any situation we encounter. So, as you look upon your own grief and the suffering of your family members, remember that in back of all of it is the shared belief (shared by all of us) that we can be deprived of love. The suffering any of us feels stems from the original thought that we have indeed separated ourselves from God's Love--depriving him of our love--and can never get it back. So again, as you work through the many challenges you face right now, on the behavioral level, do whatever you need to do to help yourself and your loved ones. Remember that the Course is not about behavior but about our thinking (in other words, which teacher we ask for help), and so there is nothing in the Course to use as a guide for behavior. But there is everything in the Course to help us choose the right teacher. Therefore, ask Jesus or the Holy Spirit in your mind to hold your hand as you do what you need to do. Bring your current darkness to their light, which is still in your mind. Let them show you how to look upon yourself and your family with compassion. They will teach you (without making you wrong) a new way to look at the losses and hardships in your life. You will see that neither you nor your family members have to feel like victims of circumstances beyond your control. And in those moments when you do feel that way, a part of you will still know that God's Love hasn't gone anywhere nor have you, and you remain perfectly safe."

    "text_input": "Q #945: My question has to do with following the idea from A Course in Miracles of \"not asking the Holy Spirit for parking spaces,\" as Ken puts it. Although I tend not to ask for help in the physical world for things for myself, I do find myself getting guidance from a source that has clearly morphed from taking Jesus' hand. The guidance is loving and leads to many holy instants where I see my brother as sinless, but it also does advise me in physical matters, such as where to live, where to go, what to say and who to say it to, etc. Is this an interim guidance that understands that I am not quite ready to walk next to Jesus in equality? Or perhaps is it equality manifesting itself in the world that I have not yet let go of? Am I getting the point sufficiently that I am supposed to accept this guidance as it leads me up the ladder? Or am I deluding myself by accepting what has been fairly accurate guidance in the physical world? A: We cannot say definitively what the source of your guidance is. It could be right-minded, reflecting your choice to switch from the ego to Jesus as your teacher. As a way of \"protecting\" herself from the full radiance of the love in her mind, Helen Schucman most of the time allowed love into her awareness only in the form of a voice telling her where to shop, where to wait for a cab, etc. (see Absence from Felicity, chapter 17). But when she no longer needed this defense, that phase of her relationship with Jesus ended; she no longer limited his love in an attempt to make it--and him--more manageable by her.",
    "output": "If your experiences are originating from a right-minded choice, they will advance you spiritually to the extent to which you do not get caught in the form of the guidance and make it into something special in your life. Try to stay with the content--the loving source in your mind-- aware that your function is to reverse your choice to be separate from that source. You make progress in fulfilling this function by asking for help to let go of your judgments of yourself and others, and instead to see yourself and others as joined in the journey to our home in Heaven, where only Oneness is true and real."

    "text_input": "Q #946: It's my understanding that in A Course in Miracles, Jesus is speaking to our mind not to our brain. It's also my understanding that there is only one mind. So how can we collectively do anything if there is only one mind and we don't exist? For example, how do we collectively dream a tsunami or any other disaster such as war? A: To answer your questions, let's start by thinking about how nighttime dreams work. In nighttime dreams, there seem to be various people interacting with each other. But when you wake up, you realize that it was all going on inside your head. All the characters in your dream were created, scripted, and directed by your imagination. No matter how many characters appeared, or how real they seemed, in the morning you open your eyes and find that there is still only one of you. Similarly, A Course in Miracles makes it clear that in reality, outside of this dream of time and space, we remain in Heaven as a \"Oneness joined as One\" (T-25.I.7). Unfortunately, we have covered this truth over with several layers of illusion, making it virtually impossible for us to understand how this could be so. But the Course helps us understand it by explaining that it all began with one thought of separation. That thought seemed to birth a mind that was separate from its Creator--a state the mind found both thrilling and terrifying. These feelings pushed the one mind to fall more deeply asleep, seeming to fragment into billions of pieces and wind up in this world of multiplicity. But each fragment, born of a single thought, retained the entire thought system of the one mind from which it came. And so, as fragments, we can have individual (and quite different) experiences of being in this world. Yet, fragmented from the same Source, we share an experience of how this world works, and the events that take place within it. You are correct that in the Course, Jesus is addressing our mind not our brain. But he is not appealing to the one mind which, being already one, does not need the message of the Course. Instead, Jesus speaks to our individual split minds. As the Course makes clear, each of us has three parts to our mind: the ego, the Holy Spirit, and the decision maker, which chooses between the two. Jesus' purpose in writing his course was to remind us that we can shift from the ego to the Holy Spirit as our internal Teacher. And so he is really speaking to the decision making part of our mind because that is the part that can make the shift. Like the one mind, the decision maker is outside of time and space. But the choices the decision maker makes determine whether we will use this dream world as a prison or as a classroom for awakening to our true home in Heaven. When the decision maker chooses the Holy Spirit, we automatically begin to reflect the oneness of Heaven in our thoughts, words, and actions. This is because, as the Course says, \"It is the Holy Spirit's function to teach you how this oneness is experienced, what you must do that it can be experienced, and where you should go to do it\" (T-25.I.6:4). And so the process the Course",
    "output": "lays out for us is really one of gradually awakening to our oneness. At the very end of the journey, we will find that even the one mind is an illusion as we at last accept that \"nowhere does the Father end [and] the Son begin as something separate from Him\" (W-pI.132.12:4).

    "text_input": "Q #947: A Course in Miracles tells me to withdraw from my ego goals, that the ego self is not my real self, and that to disengage from the ego is the only road to peace and joy. I want to do this, but I also want the money. How do I reconcile the two?",
    "output": "We will answer your question, but whom should we bill for the service? :-) Seriously, though, believe it or not, you do not have to reconcile the two. The Course does not ask us to give up anything we are still attached to. In fact, it states, \"It would indeed be strange if you were asked to go beyond all symbols of the world ... You have need to use the symbols of the world a while\" (W-pI.184.9:1-2). Certainly money is one of the most potent symbols in this world. The fact that you have a special relationship with it hardly places you in a unique position. But the fact that you are willing to be honest about it gives you a wonderful opportunity to do what the Course actually advises. That means inviting the Holy Spirit to simply look at it with you. In other words, ask Him to help you watch all your financial transactions without judging or justifying them. Remember that the Course tells us \"the Holy Spirit uses special relationships, which you have chosen to support the ego, as learning experiences that point to truth. Under His teaching, every relationship becomes a lesson in love\" (T-15.V.4:5). So you do not want to give up special relationships because they are the very things the Holy Spirit can use to heal your mind. Where there is a special relationship (in other words, a history of the ego running the show), there is always the presence of guilt and fear. And that certainly describes the feelings most of us have-- consciously or unconsciously--around money. So the first lesson in love the Holy Spirit might give you about money could be to have compassion for your own fear-based attachment to it. And since guilt and fear are the ego's bread and butter, that is the beginning of withdrawing from the ego. As that happens, you will gradually find yourself feeling a greater sense of ease around money, regardless of what is happening externally. So to summarize: When it comes to switching from the ego to the Holy Spirit, you do not have to make any withdrawals until you lose interest. And when you cannot find your balance, let Jesus reconcile the difference."

    "text_input": "Q #948: I have been in a troubled love relationship for five years. Sometimes when we're in conflict, I accept what is being mirrored back to me as my own lack and wrong mindedness, and I feel at peace. At other times, I feel resentment toward my partner and envy other couples that I perceive as having more of a joint vision. A Course in Miracles teaches not to seek outside yourself and not to try and find another relationship that my ego would like better. Soon we will be seeing a counselor to help us with our issues. I know that the objective for the counselor will be to help us create more ego-based congruence. So how do I do this and stay true to the teaching  of the Course? And if my goal is ego-based anyway, why not just find another relationship with someone who is more compatible with me?",
    "output": "A Course in Miracles is a guide that helps us shift from the ego to the Holy Spirit as our internal Teacher. It is not a guide to behavior. Thus, staying true to the teaching of the Course is solely a matter of what goes on in your mind. From the perspective of the Course, then, going to see a counselor for help with your issues is no more right or wrong than drinking water when you feel thirsty. The water is not healing. But it would be neither loving nor helpful to deny your body the liquid it requires to function and feel healthy. Similarly, counseling may not heal your mind. But if it can help alleviate your mental anguish, then it would be silly not to partake in it. In addition, all of our physical and psychological issues are, in reality, barriers we created to keep the Love of God out of our mind. Therefore, taking whatever actions will lessen their effects can be a helpful first step toward ultimately remembering God's Love. In the supplement Psychotherapy: Purpose, Practice and Process, Jesus states that \"It is in the instant that the therapist forgets to judge the patient that healing occurs\" (P-3.II.6.1). Clearly, Jesus is not opposed to therapy. Moreover, we could replace the words therapist and patient with any two people who have a relationship. Healing occurs when we do not judge another--or ourselves. Thus, from Jesus' perspective, whether you stay or leave a specific partner is irrelevant. What matters is how you stay or leave. This is why the Course urges us to ask the Holy Spirit for help questioning the purpose of all our thoughts and actions. The Holy Spirit knows that though they wear a million disguises, there are only two purposes we can have. We are always either projecting guilt or extending love. The Holy Spirit will always let us see which one we are doing. Happily, He is an internal Therapist Who will always forget to judge us. So, if we hold His Hand, everything we do will become a healing classroom in forgiveness. Filled with His forgiveness and Love, you will recognize that neither you nor your partner is guilty--you are both simply afraid of love. It might be helpful for the two of you to work on this issue together, or it might be better to do it apart. But whether you stay together or break up, you will do so with a gentle kindness--a kindness that wants only what is best for both of you.

So, I take it that my cat's mind and my mind are joined. I feel that my cat tried to stay alive longer than she wanted to, just for me, because she could feel that I truly loved her. I can still feel her presence now telling me that she had a peaceful transition and that she knows I tried my best to help her. There is nothing in A Course in Miracles that would invalidate my experience; is there?",
    "output": "No, there is nothing in A Course in Miracles that would invalidate your experience. The Course tells us repeatedly that minds are joined, and it means all minds. It does not matter whether we appear in this dream as human beings or as animals, we are all fragments of the same one mind that fell asleep and dreamed up a world in which we appear to be separate from each other and from God. It sounds like the connection you continue to feel with your cat is providing you with great comfort. In case you--like many pet owners--are tempted to feel guilt over her death, let's take a quick look at this issue. Because pets are dependent upon us for their very survival, owning them places us in a God-like role. After all, they do not appear to need God; they appear to need us. Unfortunately, along with the God-like role we play in our pets' lives comes the agonizing sense that we are not up to the task and will destroy them--revealing ourselves as the murderers we judge ourselves to be. So relationships with pets (just like all relationships) are generally fraught with guilt. And indeed, there usually does come a point at which we have to decide when and how our pets will die. It would be difficult to imagine a more potent trigger for ontological guilt than this. But this can also provide a great opportunity for changing our mind. The Course tells us that the body \"neither lives nor dies\" (T-6.V-A.1:4) and that \"In the holy instant the condition of love is met, for [in that instant] minds are joined without the body's interference, and where there is communication there is peace\" (T-15.XI.7:1). Clearly, from Jesus' perspective (outside of this dream world), the body is nothing. To him, physical existence is irrelevant to the expression of love between minds. So, crazy as it sounds from our perspective, your relationship with your cat is no more or less real now than it was when she appeared to be physically present. Either way, she is nothing more than a symbol in your mind. And either way, if you hold the ego's hand she becomes a symbol of guilt, while if you hold the Holy Spirit's hand, she becomes a symbol of love and forgiveness. If she has become a reminder to you that you do not have the power to hurt another and that there is a love in your mind that remains constant and unaffected by outside events, then that is a very helpful thing. Let her help you remember that no matter what happens between bodies, not one note in Heaven's song will be missed (T-26.V.5:4).

In #655 you say there's nothing wrong with trying to get guilt based addictive behavior under control, I have tried for 30 years without success. My classroom is overeating and being overweight. When I eat or think about food, or I think about exercise I feel guilty. It seems no matter what, I feel guilty. I would like to know where the Holy Spirit fits in this. Do I just say help me with this; do I think about Him? I don't know how to recruit His help since I am always guilty no matter what.",
    "output": "At the center of the problem, as you describe it, is guilt, not food or weight. It is not only the problem, it is the goal. Seeking to change form (even for 30 years) without relinquishing guilt is the mind's way of having its cake and eating it, too. The missing link in the equation is the hidden desire to hold on to guilt. In the text, Jesus tells us the first obstacle to peace: \"The Desire to Get Rid of It\" (T-19.IV-A) is fueled by the \"attraction of guilt\" (T-19.IV-A.i). Although it may seem that cake, pasta, or potato chips, are the big attraction, the real draw is to the guilt seemingly engendered by the food. Guilt is the ego's nourishment, so when the mind chooses the ego as its teacher, it will seek for guilt and find it, in order to sustain its belief in the reality of the ego. Therefore, used as a classroom, being overweight is a very helpful tool to get in touch with guilt, which in turn reveals the hidden choice the mind has made to identify with the ego. Being willing to see being overweight and the body itself (large or small) in this light is the first way the Holy Spirit steps into the picture. Weight loss programs do not identify the mind's choice for the ego as the source of the problem. Nor do they offer a guilt-reducing regime to help solve the problem, as the Holy Spirit does. The Holy Spirit's diet begins with the distinction between form and content, whereby the true source of addiction is recognized as the mind's choice between the ego and the Holy Spirit (content), rather than the body's choice (form) between chips or carrots. The Holy Spirit's goal is to teach us to recognize the source of the problem, so it can be healed. When the body says \"I want potato chips,\" it is reflecting the mind that says \"I want guilt to feed my belief in the separation.\" All the bad feelings that come with eating (or obsession with thinness) keep attention focused on the choices the body makes, which keeps the mind's power to choose between the ego or the Holy Spirit from awareness. Efforts to solve the eating addiction on the body's terms will fail, as your 30 years have proved, because the addiction is in the mind that wants to feed on guilt. Asking the Holy Spirit for help in undoing guilt means accepting, first of all, that this is indeed the problem, which is not as easy as it sounds. In fact, the reason we look for solutions in the body and its behavior is precisely because we do not want to let go of identity with the body. When the body thinks it can sneak in a few potato chips that won't show up on the scale, it mirrors the mind's sneaky thought that it can get away with seeking happiness in a thin body and God won't notice. The truth is God does not notice, but the mind will inevitably feel the pain and guilt that come from seeking from the ego/body what it cannot give, and turning away from the real happiness of oneness with our Source. Overeating is just one of the endless forms the ego uses to camouflage content and act out its tale of sin, guilt, and fear. Every special relationship has this same goal. Anything serves as the subject for a special relationship. At the top of the list is the body with its multitudinous needs, and its crowning triumph--death. The death of the body is the ego's final proof that the separation did occur and guilt is real, justified, and inescapable. With this belief firmly held, no wonder food looks good. The guilt of identifying with the body is severely painful. Jesus uncovers for us the insanity of the ego's attraction to pain and guilt: \"Under fear's orders the body will pursue guilt, serving its master whose attraction to guilt maintains the whole illusion of its existence. This, then, is the attraction of pain. Ruled by this perception the body becomes the servant of pain, seeking it dutifully and obeying the idea that pain is pleasure. It is this idea that underlies all of the ego's heavy investment in the body. And it is this insane relationship that it keeps hidden, and yet feeds upon. To you it teaches that the body's pleasure is happiness. Yet to itself it whispers, 'It is death.'\" (T-19.IV-B.13:2-8). Just as weight loss programs usually ask clients to pay attention to eating habits so they can be changed, the Holy Spirit asks us to recognize the thought system the mind has chosen and its devastating effects, so another choice can be made. His solution to the body's being overweight is to undo belief in the guilt that keeps the mind frozen in its mistaken choice. His curriculum offers release from guilt and a new perception of the body, whether its form be large or small: \" ... the reality of guilt is the illusion that seems to make it (the body) heavy and opaque, impenetrable, and a real foundation for the ego's thought system. Its thinness and transparency are not apparent until you see the light behind it. And then you see it as a fragile veil before the light\" (T-18.IX.5:2-4, italics added). Herein lies the real thinness we all seek."

    "text_input": "Q #951: I have been living in my car because I have no money and no job; and I have lost confidence in my ability to provide for myself. What have I done wrong to be left in this situation? I am a good person and I envision a world of love and beauty; but I find myself living here in hell. What kind of act of God does it take to leave this behind and move on? I would gladly (I think) trade all this madness for a place of beauty and love; I just can't find it here anymore. What do I do? I still believe in asking the Holy Spirit for help; yet I still live in this illusory madness. A: As strange as it may sound, it is still possible to be at peace even though your external situation is so bleak. If there is one lesson Jesus is trying to help us learn, it is that peace is not conditional on anything other than our choice to accept it as our natural state as God's Son, which means nothing external can either give us peace or take it away. Most students find this principle terribly difficult to apply. That is why it can be very helpful to approach your life situation as a classroom in which you can choose to be taught either by the ego or by Jesus. The ego would urge you to see the world as a hell that ceaselessly victimizes you, and then to blame others or yourself (\"what have I done wrong?\") for being in that state. Jesus or the Holy Spirit in your right mind would encourage you to use the world to help you free yourself from the limited self-concept you have developed--as a prisoner of the world, from which you seek to escape. The ego offers you one way of interpreting your situation; Jesus and the Holy Spirit offer you a radically different one; the ego's further imprisons you in the world of separation; Jesus' helps free you from those chains by having you shift the purpose of everything you do, and to learn to see your interests and your purpose as the same as everyone else's. With regard to your dire financial situation, you might consider finding a shelter for the homeless, where you more than likely would be put in touch with sources of financial aid and job opportunities. To go in that direction could reflect a right-minded choice to identify with healing rather than defeat and the need to escape. If you keep in mind that you want Jesus, not your ego, to accompany you in your search for financial help, then you will be peaceful and advance spiritually, regardless of how things turn out. This, you might say, is the \"act of God\" you are asking about, and this is how you \"move on.\" As long as you see the world as hell, you can never escape from it no matter what you do, for you would be giving it a power it does not really have. That is the advantage of seeing the world as a classroom in which Jesus can teach you how to use it to heal your mind of its mistaken thoughts about who you are and what the world is. The world of love and beauty you desire is in your mind (your right mind), unaffected by external events-- and that is what you can learn as you go about finding a source of income and a place to live.",

    "text_input": "Q #952: Does God know that we are here in this so-called dream?",
    "output": "A Course in Miracles tells us that, \"God does not know of separation\" (P-2.VII.1:1,11). Because this is obviously a world of separation--separate bodies, with seemingly separate interests, leading separate lives--such a statement means that God could not possibly know about this world, nor us as the individuals we think we are. At first, the concept that God does not know about all this can be very frightening. But this turns out to be good news once we realize that God does not know that we are here because we are not here. The Course teaches us that we are \"at home in God, dreaming of exile\" (T-10.I.2:1). In other words, this is our dream. God, being outside of this dream, cannot know about this world, any more than one person could know the contents of another's sleeping dreams at night. The process of the Course is one of gradually discovering that we are not the individuals we think we are, and that God is not a being who is separate from us. Jesus informs us that in reality \"nowhere does the Father end [and] the Son begin as something separate from Him\" (W- pI.132.12:4)--we are a \"Oneness joined as One\" (T-25.I.7:1). But Jesus knows that this is virtually incomprehensible to us from where we think we are inside this dream. He realizes that the first step of our journey to awakening must consist of replacing our fearful image of God with one that can be a source of comfort. For this reason, more often than not, he speaks to us in the Course as if God were a separate being Who knows about us. And as long as we believe that we are individuals, we really cannot help but think of God in this way. So the most helpful thing we as Course students can do for ourselves is to simply follow the process Jesus lays out for us. That means increasingly choosing Jesus or the Holy Spirit instead of the ego as our internal teacher. As we do so, we will come to know that God's Love is real and available to us, despite our inability to fully understand its source--an understanding that we can rest assured will come to us when we are ready for it."

    "text_input": "Q #953: My husband and I run a small business. Lately we've had a rash of experiences in which suppliers send us damaged goods or behave in slightly hostile ways. I understand that these experiences are symbolic of my fear of God, resulting in guilt and a belief in punishment. What is new is that I feel as though I can't bear to argue with any of this--to be angry with the suppliers, to worry about the money, or to do anything about it at all! It's as though I just can't do it anymore. \"In my defenselessness my safety lies\" has become my motto. I just can't bear to defend myself in most situations. It hurts too much. And yet there's the (ego?) fear that I am using the Course to avoid confrontation, or misinterpreting the guidance I seek but am never sure I'm hearing correctly. I feel as though in this life I've overcharged or delivered defective goods in any number of ways. Why should I defend myself against, or be angry about, such treatment from others when I want to forgive them. I'd prefer to just ignore it and let it happen. I just want to let it go and forgive everyone, even if it costs me money or causes me inconvenience. This seems a small price to pay for peace of mind. Am I deluding myself? A: Because A Course in Miracles is a guide to changing your mind not your behavior, there is no right or wrong way to handle things as a Course student. However, it may be helpful to clarify what Jesus means by defenselessness. The Course's concept of defenselessness has nothing to do with behavior. It is strictly about what happens in the mind. When we choose the ego as our internal teacher, we begin with the premise that we are guilty for having stolen our very existence from God. Then we repress that thought and project it onto others, convincing ourselves that they stole the peace of God from us. On the level of form, we reflect these dynamics whenever we get upset with another person. Whether we are annoyed that they cut us off on the freeway, or furious that they stole our money, underneath our upset is the accusation that they stole the peace of God. On the other hand, when we choose the Holy Spirit as our internal Teacher, no matter what we experience in the world, we know that God's Love is still in our mind. And since it is there, all",
    "output": "the things of which we accuse ourselves clearly have had no effect, and therefore must be made up. That means we are innocent, and if we are, so must everyone else be. With that awareness, it is impossible to do anything but extend love. This then is Jesus' definition of defenselessness: when we feel no need to defend because nothing has the power to take away our peace. Obviously, very few of us can claim to have achieved that state (and the last thing we should do is pretend that we have). Indeed, the purpose of the Course is to give us a road map for getting there. It sends us on an inner journey, which consists of turning every experience in our lives into a classroom in forgiveness. Unfortunately, because of our conditioning to decide everything based on form rather than content, many students inadvertently get off course (pun intended) by assuming that forgiveness means--as you stated--ignoring everything and letting it happen. Jesus is not asking us to do that. In fact, letting events in which we appear to be victimized simply happen, as we try to forgive the perpetrator, often leads us right into a vicious ego trap. Not only do our feelings of victimization remain in place (and certain to be projected elsewhere), but we also get to feel superior to those who appear to have wronged us. For example, you said that you want to forgive even if it costs you money and causes you inconvenience. That might be okay, but be sure that you are not implying a causal relationship that does not exist. Do not think that letting another take something from you--in other words, sacrificing something--is a necessary part of your experiencing forgiveness. In reality, there is no link between sacrifice and forgiveness. Nor do you deserve to be mistreated now because you overcharged or delivered defective goods in the past. Like sacrifice, suffering and payback play no part in forgiveness. It is the ego that loves these setups because they mean that you get to be a hero in your own mind (and perhaps the eyes of the world) while the other person remains a villain. Furthermore, you maintain your belief in separate interests. The other person has done something apparently dishonest or unkind and you have decided that it is in your best interest to simply accept it and in his or her best interest not to look at it at all. This could very well be denying both of you your classrooms. The chances are good that you would get the greatest healing from doing what so-called normal people do, but giving it a different purpose. In other words, take the appropriate action to prevent others from taking advantage of you, but do so without hating or mentally attacking them. That, of course, requires that before you do anything, you ask the Holy Spirit to look with you at the guilt, fear, and anger that are still in your mind. This will always lead you to discover the course of action that would best serve the interest you share with your brother--awakening from this dream. And then you will feel a true sense of peace that makes it clear you have not deluded yourself."

    "text_input": "Q #954: A Course in Miracles says that it is only one of many paths home. Yet I've heard that the only way home is to leave the dream. But since no other paths say this world is a dream, or explain how we got here, or the ego thought system, or ontological guilt, or that bodies don't exist, or that there's only one of us here not billions and billions, etc., etc., how can there really be other paths that lead us to peace and then home? The metaphysics is so essential that in my opinion, the Course is the only way home. Please explain what other paths the Course refers to in the aforementioned statement. And can we really get home without understanding our own  psychology and why we act the way we do? It seems to me that the Course was written because no other path had awakened us to these ideas.",
    "output": "You are correct that the metaphysics and psychology of A Course in Miracles are unique. And it is almost inevitable that if the Course speaks to you, it will feel like the only possible way home. But followers of most paths would make exactly the same assertion--and, as world history attests, all too often do so in very unkind ways. The certainty that ours is the one and only way is a result of confusion between form and content. When we consider spiritual paths, we could think of the content as being synonymous with the purpose or goal, and the form as being the method for achieving that goal. The Course tells us that the holy instant, the holy relationship, and the Holy Spirit's teaching \"are all but aspects of the plan to change your dreams of fear to happy dreams, from which you waken easily to knowledge\" (T-18.V.1:4). Indeed, that is an excellent summation of the purpose of the Course itself. It seeks to help us shift our mind from our imagined guilt (symbolized in the Course by the ego), to the memory of God's all-inclusive Love (symbolized in the Course as the Holy Spirit). Within this dream world, once we have made that shift, we will go from projecting guilt everywhere, to extending love. How and when that shift leads to our awakening from the dream is neither our concern, nor the concern of the Course-- which tells us that God Himself will be responsible for that final step (T-18.IX.10). The Course, then, is not our way home. Rather it is a tool for creating the conditions in our mind in which we can find our way home. While the Course can lead us to truth, we should not confuse its words, metaphysics, and psychology, with truth itself. As the Course says, \"words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality\" (M-21.1:9-10). So while the love that inspired the Course is real, at some point we must realize that the Course itself is still part of the illusion. If it is the part of the illusion that helps us awaken to what lies beyond the illusion, then that is a marvelous thing. But that does not mean that it is the only thing in this dream that can serve that purpose, or that it will serve that purpose for everyone. To some, the Course's explanation of how we got here and why we do what we do might make no sense at all. But that certainly does not mean that they cannot awaken to the Love of God. A person could have a right-minded experience while reading the Course, watching a sunset, reading the Bible, thumbing through the phone book, in the middle of a war zone, or in a million other scenarios. This is why the Course says that there are \"many thousands of other forms, all with the same outcome\" (M-1.4:1-2). In statements such as that, Jesus is really saying that form is irrelevant--it is the meaning, or purpose, that we give the form that matters. Therefore, Jesus is not referring to other specific forms. Rather he is acknowledging that the prerequisite to awakening is not any specific knowledge, form, or world-view, but rather a single decision. And what leads anyone else to make that decision, or why it does so, is beyond our comprehension and not our concern. In this regard, it is helpful to remember that: \"A teacher of God is anyone who chooses to be one. His qualifications consist solely in this; somehow, somewhere he has made a deliberate choice in which he did not see his interests as apart from someone else's\" (M-1.1:1-2)."

    "text_input": "Q #955: So many of the new writings from the world's spiritual teachers talk about the importance of the heart, love and compassion in the path to ascension. There is much talk of the \"wisdom of the heart.\" A Course in Miracles really only mentions the mind. When it speaks of the mind, how does that relate to the concept of heart used by other authors?",
    "output": "The love and compassion that are considered attributes of the heart reflect the mind's choice to identify with the Holy Spirit. They flow naturally, unimpeded by the ego's judgment when the mind is no longer blocked by the guilt and fear of choosing separation. As you mention, the Course tells us that only the mind exists and there is nothing outside of it, including wisdom of the heart. The Course is very clear in this, indeed the foundation of its teaching rests on this principle: \"It [the mind] does not go out. Within itself it has no limits, and there is nothing outside it ... It encompasses you entirely; you within it and it within you. There is nothing else, anywhere or ever\" (T-18.VI.8:7-11). Heart is used symbolically in the Course as a term we are familiar with and relate to more easily than the term mind. However, it can only be understood as referring to the mind. In the many passages where the term heart is used, it means the part of the mind that holds the memory of God's Love. In a very beautiful passage Jesus uses the symbol of the heart and the body to describe the peace filled state of the right mind: \"I place the peace of God in your heart and in your hands, to hold and share. The heart is pure to hold it, and the hands are strong to give it. We cannot lose. My judgment is as strong as the wisdom of God, in Whose Heart and Hands we have our being\" (T-5.IV.8:10-13). In these terms we find not only the true condition of the mind when it chooses against the ego, but the all-inclusive extension of this truth that is true compassion. The compassion the Course teaches is to see everyone in the light of the memory of our oneness with the Father. Everyone is thus included in this compassionate perspective, and seen as remembering or forgetting, choosing oneness or separation, whatever the form may be. In this wisdom of the right mind all other interpretations, judgments and perceptions cease. This is accomplished through the practice of forgiveness, which is both the wisdom of the heart and compassion as taught in the Course. Wisdom is generally understood as good judgment, but as with everything understood generally, Jesus takes it a step further in the Course. He tells us in the manual: \"Wisdom is not judgment; it is the relinquishment of judgment\" (M-10.4:5). Thus, we find wisdom of the heart in the Course through the process of forgiveness. Indeed, the heart of the Course is learning the compassion of forgiveness, whereby we relinquish judgment and become truly wise."

    "text_input": "Q #956: I understand that I really do not want the peace of God, and that I need to ask Jesus to help me look at this fact without guilt or judgment. Yet my life still seems to be one conflict after another. I am aware that I do not want to let my specialness go and I ask for help with this. But I just seem to be stuck in the victim mode. What should I do?",
    "output": "One of the things studying and applying A Course in Miracles does for us is to reveal just how deeply split our mind is. On one hand, the Course helps us see that despite our vastly differing scripts, basically everyone's life (with very few exceptions, such as Jesus') can be boiled down to three rather miserable acts: we are born, we struggle, and we die--hardly a storyline any sane mind would choose for itself, and certainly one in which we are a perpetual victim. On the other hand, the Course tells us that we have the power to change this experience--that by changing internal teachers, we could see peace instead of this (W-pI.34). If we believe that we have this power-- and part of us must, or we would not be drawn to the Course--then it is natural to wonder why we do not just make this internal shift, feel better, and get on with it. But the Course answers that question when it tells us that \"No one who sees himself as guilty can avoid the fear of God\" (T-30.VI.4:4). In other words, we will be afraid of God (and of the internal shift that would bring us closer to Him), as long as we have any guilt left in our mind. And as long as we retain any belief in the reality of our physical existence and of this world, our mind will contain guilt--the unconscious conviction that we stole our existence from God and deserve to be punished for it. This is why our journey as Course students can seem so slow, difficult, and filled with setbacks. While we have found clever ways to disguise this fact, our entire lives up to this point have been elaborate schemes to keep us in the victim mode, precisely so that we will never return to the peace and Love of God, which we perceive as our greatest threat. As we begin to do what Jesus asks of us and question every value that we hold (T-24.in.2:1), we start to feel how desperately we do want to return to God's Love, and how much we have suffered in our seemingly separated state. Yet it takes time to undo an entire thought system and we cannot expect the ego to just give up without a fight. So your experience of being stuck in the victim mode, while undoubtedly painful, is certainly not unique, nor is it really the problem. Rather, it is simply a reflection of the fact that you still fear God's Love and your mind's ability to choose it. Thus, you do not need to do anything about it. Rather, you could just view it as helpful information. In fact, whenever we find ourselves feeling like victims, we can simply notice it and say, \"Aha, I am still scared and that is all right.\" In this way, we will be practicing the forgiveness with ourselves that will ultimately loosen the ego's choke-hold. One of the keys to progressing on our journey home is the discovery that, despite its slippery cleverness, there is one thing the ego cannot pervert to serve its own means: our failure to make a big deal about something."

    "text_input": "Q #957: It's almost as though I am my own worst enemy. After some upset happens, I find a place of peace. Then, almost immediately, I say something that completely obliterates any peaceful feelings. Am I supposed to try to get better at this, or just notice that I keep doing it and ask for a \"holy instant\"? Are these non-peaceful actions and words unavoidable, or are they proof that I'm doing it wrong? I want this to be my last time here. This world seems very hard to me. A: You are not doing it wrong. While it may be unpleasant, the fact that you are noticing yourself quickly and consistently pushing away virtually all experiences of inner peace is actually very helpful. Developing this awareness is a critical part of progressing as a Course student. A Course in Miracles tells us that \"The ego will attack your motives as soon as they become clearly out of accord with its perception of you. This is when it will shift abruptly from suspiciousness to viciousness, since its uncertainty is increased\" (T-9.VII.4:6-7). In other words, whenever you have an experience of peace, the ego will sense that its days could be numbered and come roaring back, louder and more ruthless than ever. Thus, virtually anyone who honestly",
    "output": "does what the Course asks will come to the realization that there is a part of his or her mind that does not want anything to do with the peace or Love of God. In an odd way then, you could feel reassured by what you have observed in yourself. Again, your awareness is a crucial step on the journey the Course asks us to take. Fortunately, the Course does not ask us to \"try to get better at this.\" Rather, it encourages us to ask Jesus or the Holy Spirit to help us simply watch without judgment everything we say and do. By simply watching ourselves through the eyes of a loving internal teacher, we can begin to see that our less-than- kind actions do not make us sinful, evil, or horrible--they simply indicate that we are terrified. And being born of the guilt-inducing belief that we exist at God's expense, our terror can only be healed through gentle forgiveness that gradually lets us know we are the \"maker of a world that is not so\" (T-25.IV.3:1). Therefore, it is very helpful to discover that we truly are our own worst enemies. Only we have the power to seemingly cut ourselves off from God's Love. But we also have the power to recognize that God's Love has not gone anywhere and is still available to us whenever we are ready for it. And as we feel God's Love more and more, we will come to know that this world is merely an element of our own misguided imaginings--not a place we need to escape from or worry about returning to."

Does this idea imply a belief in, or recognition of, the phenomenon of reincarnation on the part of Jesus? Doesn't the Course also say that we could be with Jesus now, if we only saw (as in vision)? Does this mean that there is no shortcut to enlightenment? No direct access to God? Also, what is the ultimate definition of miracle in the Course? I know that there are 50 miracle principles, and the term miracle is used frequently in the text. But I find that these are just hints pointing to the real meaning of miracle. The Course doesn't seem to be referring to what we usually describe as a miracle.",
    "output": "Jesus tells us in the Course that \"The miracle substitutes for learning that might have taken thousands of years\" (T-1.2.6:7). So let us start by examining what he means by miracle. He means a shift of internal teachers in our mind. It is a choice to listen to the Holy Spirit's or Jesus' guidance (which will always lead us to extend love) rather than to the ego's raucous shrieking (which will always compel us to project guilt). Notice that the miracle is not the extension of love--the extension is a reflection of the miracle that occurred in the mind, and it can take many different forms. The miracle, as defined by Jesus in the Course, has nothing to do with bodies, physical phenomena, or anything in the world. It is solely a shift in thinking. However, it is a shift so profound that it automatically transforms us from a mindset of trying to get our perceived needs met at any cost, to one of knowing that our only real need is to remember God's Love--a need we share with everyone else who believes that they are here. As a result, in the moment when we truly experience the miracle, there is no way we could say, do, or think anything that is not motivated by love. The aim of the Course is to help us set up the conditions in our mind to experience the miracle more and more. One of the ways Jesus motivates us to listen to his message is by promising to save us time. And it is true that doing what he asks of us will seem to save us time. Using this world as a classroom in forgiveness will gradually decrease our compulsion to repeat painful and destructive patterns in our lives. So, for example, rather than spending an entire life unconsciously drawing experiences to us in which we feel like victims, Jesus or the Holy Spirit will help us remove (through forgiveness) the ontological guilt from our mind that compelled us to use victimization as a defense against God's Love. In this way, we can actually use our time here to get closer to awakening to our true home in Heaven rather than as an indefinite prison sentence. This does not mean, however, that Jesus believes in time. He tells us that \"time but lasted an instant in your mind, with no effect upon eternity\" (T-26.V.3:3) and that truth is \"far beyond time\" (T-15.II.1:9). Thus, it is clear that he speaks about time in the Course only because he knows we believe in it. It is one of the symbols in our dream that Jesus must use in order to motivate us and help us grasp what he is talking about. In keeping with his knowledge of the unreality of time, Jesus tells us: \"In the ultimate sense, reincarnation is impossible. There is no past or future, and the idea of birth into a body has no meaning either once or many times. Reincarnation cannot, then, be true in any real sense\" (M- 24.1:1-3). But he also says that \"the way to salvation can be found by those who believe in reincarnation and by those who do not\" (M-24.2:8), and that \"there is always some good in any thought which strengthens the idea that life and the body are not the same\" (M-24.2:5). There are passages in the Course in which Jesus seems to imply that reincarnation is a real phenomenon. But that would make it real only in that it happens within the dream. Jesus' primary message is that nothing that happens within this dream is real. And so, ultimately, Jesus and his course are not concerned with reincarnation or anything involving bodies. Like the concept of time, if reincarnation is a meaningful concept to us, Jesus is happy to work with it. But he does so only as part of his strategy for helping us move beyond all concepts that obscure our reality as the one changeless Son of God. Finally, about your question of being with Jesus now, direct access to God, and a shortcut to enlightenment: The Course states, \"Sometimes a teacher of God may have a brief experience of direct union with God. In this world, it is almost impossible that this endure. It can, perhaps, be won after much devotion and dedication, and then be maintained for much of the time on earth. But this is so rare that it cannot be considered a realistic goal. If it happens, so be it. If it does not happen, so be it as well. All worldly states must be illusory. If God were reached directly in sustained awareness, the body would not be long maintained\" (M-26.3:1-8). We must read this passage with awareness that (despite its frequent use of anthropomorphic language to describe Him) the God the Course refers to is not a being but a state. It is \"a Oneness which unites all things within Itself\" (T-25.I.7:2). Were we to fully understand what this means and achieve sustained awareness of it, we would not be here long because we would have awakened to the fact that we are not here. Knowing that we are safely at home in Heaven, most of us would no longer have any purpose for continuing this dream. But that is the end of the journey the Course takes us on. As such, it is really not our concern. Far more helpful to us at this point, is to focus on the Course's emphasis that Jesus, as a teacher, is in our mind, and that if we choose to listen to him now, we will experience the Love of God, which is also in our mind now. Therefore, we already have direct access to everything we need for enlightenment--the Course's curriculum for embracing it is the shortcut.

    "text_input": "Q #959: I'm quite concerned about something that I have just read. Professor Per singer is man who has conducted many experiments on people in relation to the brain and God. Some of his subjects reported that they connected with God, saw God, saw Jesus, went to a place of space like emptiness and some even saw UFOs. He claims that when we have a divine union with God, or anything that seems to be out of the ordinary, it is merely parts of the brain being activated in different ways than normal. It makes me feel really sick to know that everything I have read on the mind and God could just be a product of our imagination. How do you really know that God is real, not just our imagination? You say that you are at an advantage because you stand outside time and space, how do you know that you haven't just activated a different part of the brain? A: First, mind and brain are two entirely different entities in A Course in Miracles. Since mind has no physical/quantitative dimensions, it cannot be studied or experimented on; and therefore the teachings of the Course are not empirically verifiable, as they pertain only to the mind. The brain--which is real only within the illusion--simply carries out the mind's wishes, and in that sense does not control our existence. The brain can simulate an experience, but that does not mean it is the experience. For example, a part of your brain can be stimulated so you will not feel hungry, even though you have not eaten; but that does not mean your body is getting nourishment. Indeed, after a while, you would die, even though you do not feel hungry. In other words, the brain lied. Likewise, one can have an experience of God's Love or Oneness through brain stimulation, but this certainly will not lead to the peace of God, awakening from the dream, or necessarily being a kinder or more loving person. This is the point of \"The Test of Truth\" section in the text (T-14.XI). The discussion there teaches us that while we can never know for sure at any given moment whether we are listening to the Holy Spirit or the ego, or that God is real or imagined, in the long run we can; for although we can fool ourselves, after a while, we cannot fool those who live or work with us, or those who know us well.",

    "text_input": "Q #960: In reference to a statement you made in the answer to #372: \"You are right, the world will not get better when we no longer believe the thought of separation from God is real; it will disappear in our awareness.\" Here's my question: when this dream of the world disappears in my awareness, what will be the experience of those in this dream with me? I believe there is one, if not several, who are \"really\" here with me, sharing my dream. To them, will I just dematerialize and be gone, or will I seem to die, or what? Or do we have the option of lucid dreaming, in other words continuing to operate here to help other fragments to awaken, all the while being fully aware and awake in God? Certainly this question is premature, as I don't expect to reach that condition any time soon, but I would hate to work so hard to reach a point where I would bring such pain and grief to those who love me. A: A phrase in the workbook serves as a foundation to respond to your question: \"There is no world apart from your ideas because ideas leave not their source, and you maintain the world",
    "output": "within your mind in thought\" (W-pI.132.10:3). The specific application is clear if we understand \"world\" to include the body, yours and everyone else's. This is the fundamental principle of A Course in Miracles which underlies its teaching that the world and the body do not exist (e.g., W-pI.132.6:2; T-18.VII.3:1). It means you cannot dematerialize because you have not materialized, any more than the images you see in nocturnal dreams materialize in your bedroom while you sleep. It is the insistence that the illusion of the dream is real that makes the dream figures seem to have life outside the mind of the dreamer. The specialness \"rules\" of the dream of separation do not apply to awakening, by the very fact that the dream requires being asleep. One rules out the other. The mind that chooses to remain asleep and identify with the figure in the dream has dissociated from its true identity as mind. This dissociation causes the identity confusion in which the dream figure (body) thinks he is the dreamer (mind) and will awaken somehow and disappear from his and everyone else's dream. Jesus tells us in the text: \"You [mind] are the dreamer of the world of dreams\" (T-27.VII.13:1). Thus, when you awaken fully, no longer choosing separation, the world will disappear just as when you wake up from a nocturnal dream the images in your dream disappear. This occurs when not one ounce of credence is given to \"the tiny, mad idea\" of separation (T-27.VIII.6:2). Meanwhile, the journey to awakening lies in the practice of forgiveness, in which nothing happens to the body because forgiveness occurs in the mind. Those who share your dream are the special relationships that intermingle in the collective dream of the mind of the Sonship. These relationships are designed according to the ego's thought system to support belief in the separation. The ego's \"proof\" that bodies are real is that they can be affected by others in positive and negative ways, thereby negating the power of the mind and giving it to the body. Thus, others seem to be responsible for the way one feels. This is the ego's best defense strategy to convince itself that the dream is reality, the separation happened, and the world is real. Central to this thought system is the ego's theme of victimization filled with tales of betrayal, abandonment, and unfair treatment. In these relationships death, the ultimate abandonment, is inevitable, as are the feelings of loss and grief that accompany it. The mind sleeps dreaming of \"life\" and \"death,\" pain and loss. Within this dream, no one escapes the pain of death. Freedom from pain and grief are found only in allowing the mind to be healed of all thoughts of body identity, and to know itself as mind with the power to choose the illusion of the world / the dream of death, or the truth of oneness with God/awakening from the dream. Therein lies the only escape from the pain of death and all awareness of the world."

Their content is the same\" (T-18.II.5:13-14). If I find the \"content\" of my sleeping dreams less forgiving, more fearful, etc., does it follow that that reflects my true state more accurately than my daytime dream content? During my waking dreams I appear to be capable of making choices to forgive and listen to the Holy Spirit; I seem to be more aware that I do, indeed, have a choice. In other words, until my sleeping dreams are governed by this same ability to exercise choice, am I not truly getting to the root of guilt and healing my mind?",
    "output": "Your sleeping dreams could simply be telling you that there is still some buried guilt that has not yet come to the surface--that there is still more work to be done. But you probably knew that already. Still, it can be helpful to get that kind of a nudge from dreams, since we can lull ourselves all too easily into thinking we are pretty good at this forgiveness stuff and don't have much further to go. In truth, though, we are deeply fearful of seeing the process through to the end, because \"the end\" is a state of selflessness, where we have let go of the self that we thought we were: a self that chooses to forgive. This conflict in our minds--wanting to go forward, but terrified of doing so --can show up in dreams as battles, struggles, torment, etc. It is not necessary to analyze the dreams, just to get a sense of what they signify--which you seem to have grasped very well. As you get more and more in touch with your fear to go all the way with forgiveness, you will become more aware of the conflict in your mind. Then as you look at that resistance calmly and without judging yourself, your dreams will reflect that new state of mind."

How does a therapist achieve this?",
    "output": "I think you may have misunderstood. Therapy is like a good aspirin, or some form of medical intervention, or a meditative walk in the woods. It's all magic, but at the level of the world, it can be very helpful. And so, at times, when people are struggling with various life issues, it can be beneficial for them to have the opportunity to get another perspective in the world's terms on what is happening for them, and perhaps learn some techniques that will enable them to get unstuck or free of their pain. But it's not that the therapist achieves anything for the patient. The therapist can point to and even help open doors, but it's the patient's or client's decision whether to walk through those doors. Now there could be times when a therapist helps a patient uncover buried sources of guilt hidden in the recesses of the patient's mind, but in nearly every case, these would still relate to past memories from this lifetime. It is very unlikely that most therapists would be helping the patient get in touch with the ontological guilt, for that is not their purpose. Nor is that necessary for the purpose that therapy is being recommended to some questioners in this forum. If the therapist is open and non-judgmental, willing to join with the patient in finding a better way to cope with emotional and psychological problems, that is enough (P-2.II.8; P-2.V.4; P-3.II.6). There is a joining and a healing in that openness that is being held out to the patient, if the patient is willing and so chooses to accept it. And the patient can use the therapy sessions to identify projections of the buried ontological guilt, regardless of the awareness or intention of the therapist, who may know and need know nothing about A Course in Miracles. It is, after all, the patient who decides what purpose everything in his or her life shall serve, and if the patient has an understanding of the purpose and practice of the Course's principles of forgiveness, any situation, including but not limited to therapy, can serve that purpose."

Sometimes these feelings are about nothing in particular, but lately I find myself feeling especially agitated when I do the exercises in the Workbook. I believe",

Of course, I don't really wish He'd leave me alone. I'm pretty sure my experience is not that unusual, but what specifically can I do to get through this and not give up? A: You are absolutely correct that your experience is not unusual. Most of us are initially drawn to A Course in Miracles because when we read it, we sense that a loving presence is speaking to us. We recognize that the path Jesus lays out for us offers true hope of escaping from the painful conditions with which we are accustomed to living. But a crucial component of Jesus' curriculum is that we become very aware of just how unhappy we really are in this world. After all, why would we be motivated to accept that this world is just a dream--let alone do the challenging inner work that leads to awakening from it--unless we realized that it is a nightmare? And so, between the many beautiful and inspiring words in the Course, Jesus takes every opportunity to let us know that this is \"a dry and dusty world, where starved and thirsty creatures come to die\" (W-pII.13.5:1). On day one of the workbook, he asks us to concentrate on the idea that nothing that we see means anything (W-pI.1). Given the fact that we have spent our entire lives up to this point believing that this world holds much that we want and that our perceptions are very meaningful, how could we not feel irritated and depressed by what Jesus is telling us? The good news though, is that what he is saying is only irritating and depressing to the ego. And contrary to what we have believed up to now, the ego is not the totality of who we are. It is but one of two internal teachers in our mind. At any moment, we can ask Jesus or the Holy Spirit within our mind, to be our guide. When we do this, we get in touch with the fact that God's Love is still available to us and is totally unaffected by the apparent darkness and misery in this world. In working with the Course, this means asking one of them to help us simply watch all the resistance we have to it (such as our irritation or depression) without judgment. Jesus and the Holy Spirit reside in that part of our mind that knows we made up all this darkness and misery precisely to obscure the Love we are now being urged to embrace. They are aware, therefore, that while Jesus tells us that forgiveness offers everything we want (W-pI.122), we think forgiveness will lead to our destruction. They see that the many negative emotions we go through in working with the Course are all merely covers for the terror that grips us when we ponder returning to a God Whom we think is filled with rage towards us--a terror that makes it inevitable that we will wish He would just go away. But Jesus and the Holy Spirit know that God is not angry with us. Thus, they see our terror as simply a silly mistake. As Course students, we should ask for their help to cultivate that attitude as well--to see our irritability and depression as understandable reactions to fear, and to not make a big deal about them. They are simply indicators that our fear of accepting God's Love and being at peace is still quite great. This is a fear that we cannot expect to just disappear after two months--or any particular amount of time--spent working with the Course. It will, however, dissipate gradually if we are willing to just let it be and have faith that Jesus is leading us through our pain because he knows that there is something much better for us on the other side of it."

    "text_input": "Q #964: I'm having a bit of a philosophical dilemma which I'm hoping you can help me resolve. A contemporary view claims that the purpose of this relative world is to be able to experience our divine nature, rather than just knowing it; and that only by having the possibility of an opposite can one experience what one truly is. This seems to imply that this world, while a dream of separation, is somehow still necessary for God to \"know Himself experientially.\" I realize that this contradicts what Jesus teaches in A Course in Miracles, which is that the world is totally meaningless and serves no purpose whatsoever, but this alternative explanation seems to make sense. I mean if Heaven is eternal peace and joy, and nothing but peace and joy, forever unchanging, then wouldn't it soon become meaningless since there would be nothing to compare it to? For example, if you throw a touchdown pass on the first try, it would be exhilarating. But if you threw nothing but touchdown passes, they would become meaningless and empty. So isn't this illusory world actually a \"good\" thing--as long as we know it's just an illusion and we're using it for the purpose of knowing ourselves as the Son of God? Isn't it, in fact, necessary to experience ourselves as That? A: This point of view is actually common to process theologies, of which Alfred North Whitehead is one notable representative.",
    "output": "There are two levels here that need to be kept distinct. A Course in Miracles teaches that in Heaven there is no separate self or mind that can evaluate its state in relation to another self or state: \"What He creates is not apart from Him, and nowhere does the Father end, the Son begin as something separate from Him\" (W-pI.132.12:4). By definition, there can be no lack in infinite Perfection, so there is nothing to learn and no potential to be fulfilled. Likewise, being bored or tired of seeing the same thing presupposes the existence of time and space, and God and Heaven transcend the limitations of time and space completely. To the ego, peace is boring, and conflict and challenge exhilarating, for the ego constantly seeks to make its own world of separation and differences real. Therefore to the extent to which we identify with the ego, we will find life without contrast and opposites inconceivable and certainly not appealing. The perfect, eternal Oneness of Heaven is beyond our comprehension, having nothing in common with the dualistic experience of our world, which consists of separate, imperfect individuals limited by space and time. You cannot take the principles of dualistic experience and apply them to non-dualistic experience. They are mutually exclusive states. The mistake so many of us make is to use our human experience as a reference point for understanding the realm of pure spirit--God and Heaven. This is part of the ego's strategy to annihilate the true God and make another god that validates its own thought system; and therefore we forget that human beings are the effect of the separated mind's decision to obliterate the truth from its awareness, and substitute another whole thought system--false from beginning to end--in its place. If that is our foundation, then how can we possibly understand anything? That is what Jesus is trying to tell us in his course--that we are confused about everything: \"When you made visible what is not true, what is true became invisible to you\" (T-12.VIII.3:1). So we need to be extremely cautious about drawing conclusions from our experience--other than that we have been totally wrong, and there must be a better way. Yet this is where A Course in Miracles is so helpful. While it tells us that we made this world \"as an attack on God\" (W-pII.3.2:1), and that \"the body was not made by love\" (T-18.VI.4:7), it also tells us that we retain in our split minds a memory of the truth, and therefore we can use the world and the body to restore that truth to our awareness by choosing against the ego's wrong- minded purpose of reinforcing separation and for the Holy Spirit's right-minded purpose of undoing our belief in separation. On this level, the world serves an important purpose: it can lead us from mindlessness back to the power of our minds to choose the truth rather than the ego's lies. And on this level our learning occurs primarily through contrast: \"Contrast and differences are necessary teaching aids, for by them you learn what to avoid and what to seek. When you have learned this, you will find the answer that makes the need for any differences disappear. Truth comes of its own will unto its own. When you have learned that you belong to truth ... you will need no contrast to help you realize that this what you want, and only this\" (T-13.XI.6:3-7). Thus, when sanity and truth have been restored to our minds, the world will disappear back into the nothingness from which it came, for it has no value in itself: \" ... if I see no value in the world as I behold it, nothing that I want to keep as mine or search for as a goal, it will depart from me. For I have not sought for illusions to replace the truth\" (W-pII.226.1:4-5)."

    "text_input": "Q #965: I am becoming more sensitive to my thoughts, and seeing the world more as an observer. But I have lost a sense of love. If everything is a dream, the world is insane, and our only purpose is to awaken, then what is there left to do? For example, I used to enjoy playing music, but now that doesn't even make sense to me. I feel sad that my experience of being here doesn't seem to contain love anymore. What has happened?",
    "output": "A Course in Miracles asks us to question every value that we hold (T-24.in.2:1). If we truly do this, while we still in fact hold these values, how could we not go through a period of disorientation and loss? Jesus expects us to go through this and repeatedly reassures us about it. He tells us that the process of undoing we have undertaken \"need not be painful, but it usually is so experienced\" (M-4.I.A.3:2). One of the central, and for the majority of students, most difficult teachings of the Course is that our concept of love is entirely false and misguided. What we have called love until now is really the ego's substitute for love. The ego defines love as getting our special needs met. That means finding an external source to fill up the lack we perceive in ourselves (caused by our belief that we separated from God, destroying Him and His Love). We can seek to be filled up by--and form special love relationships with--other people, substances, or activities. But doing so is a set up because we are asking something outside of us to save us from our own self-hatred and nothing can actually do that. Through practicing the Course, it gradually dawns on us that our notion of love makes no sense and that we do not know what real love is. At that point, we start to understand that this world offers nothing we want, but we do not yet comprehend what we do want. Jesus understands the despair this engenders, telling us that \"Men have died on seeing this, because they saw no way except the pathways offered by the world. And learning they led nowhere, lost their hope\" (T- 31.IV.3:4-5). But then Jesus continues, \"And yet this was the time they could have learned their greatest lesson. All must reach this point, and go beyond it. It is true indeed there is no choice at all within the world. But this is not the lesson in itself. The lesson has a purpose, and in this you come to understand what it is for\" (T-31.IV.3:6-10). In other words, Jesus has a purpose in helping us to see the futility of searching for love in this world. He wants us to stop settling for the ego's \"shabby substitute\" for love and to reawaken to the grandeur of the Holy Spirit's Love that is still in our mind. That means, no longer seeking for love outside ourselves but rather asking the Holy Spirit to teach us what love really is. From reading the Course, we can understand intellectually that real love means reflecting God's Love through forgiveness (in other words, taking back the projections of guilt we have placed upon ourselves as well as everyone and everything else). But only by holding the Holy Spirit's hand can we actually find out how to do that. And that means we need a classroom in which to practice. You are correct that the Course informs us that the separation never happened and this physical life we think we are living is a dream. But that doesn't mean there is no point to what we do here. Because we believe we are here, our activities and relationships are the classrooms in which we can learn what love really is. This is why Jesus states, \"the Holy Spirit would not deprive you of your special relationships, but would transform them\" (T-17.IV.2:3). So, as Course students we do not want to drop our special relationships or daily activities. Rather, we want to ask the Holy Spirit to guide us through them. We want to engage in them with Him as our Teacher. Doing this turns everything into an opportunity to shift our purpose from attack and separation to forgiveness and joining. Approached in this way, our daily activities make perfect sense and acquire great meaning. Then something like playing music can become a symbol of God's Love in your mind and a source of great joy. And this is how (is in fact the only way) we begin to awaken from this dream. Happy Music Making!"

I really don't want to go, but feel like the Holy Spirit is making me because circumstances are aligning themselves so that I almost have no choice. I guess I kind of feel coerced by the Holy Spirit. Why can't He teach me without sending me into a situation where I  am going to be uncomfortable? Why can't He say, \"Okay, since you do not want to go, let's learn the lesson that you have to learn in another, more comfortable way\"?",
    "output": "Your anger over feeling pushed to do something that you would rather not do is very understandable. But feeling coerced by the Holy Spirit comes from a basic misunderstanding of what the Holy Spirit is. A Course in Miracles talks about the Holy Spirit and the ego as if they were separate entities that control our thoughts. But in reality, they are merely two exclusive thought systems, each of which can be boiled down to one core thought. The ego is a thought system born of the belief that our separation from God really happened and is very serious. As a result, our ego thoughts always reflect the premise that we destroyed Heaven, are very guilty, and deserve punishment. For most of us, the ego directs 99.9% of our thinking since we almost always think we are really here in a body, within a world. The Holy Spirit meanwhile, is the memory of God that we brought into this dream that reminds us of our true Identity as God's one Son. More specifically, the Holy Spirit is the knowledge (completely forgotten by most of us on a conscious level) that we never separated from God and are therefore still at home in Heaven and merely \"dreaming of exile\" (T-10.I.2). All thoughts that follow this one core thought reflect the love, forgiveness, and compassion that an awareness of our own innocence inspires. In the Course, Jesus speaks of the Holy Spirit as if He were a teacher who will do things for us. But Jesus is simply using metaphorical language to help make the Holy Spirit something we can relate to. Because we believe we are individuals living in a world of form, it is nearly impossible for us to relate to abstract ideas. So Jesus personalizes the Holy Spirit for us. He knows we need this in order to conceptualize a source for the right-minded thoughts we've forgotten we can choose. The Holy Spirit can't do things in this world because there is no world. Ultimately, choosing the Holy Spirit as our Teacher will awaken us to that reality. But before that happens, the Holy Spirit (in other words, our choosing the thought system of the memory of God's Love) will reinterpret everything we do here, giving it a loving purpose. That is why the Course says the Holy Spirit \"uses everything for good, but He does not believe in what is not true\" (T-6.II.10:2). As Course students, when we begin to feel victimized by the Holy Spirit, Jesus, or his course, we can be certain that the ego has taken charge of our studies (again speaking metaphorically of the ego as an entity). Remember that the ego's mission is always to prove that we are victims, but that it is somebody else's fault. For example, if we work, the ego will turn our job into an opportunity to resent our boss. If we are married, the ego will turn our marriage into an opportunity to resent our spouse. So why would studying the Course be any different? We should expect the ego to be even louder if it senses we've come upon something that might cause us to question its authority. So the ego sees us working with this Course and says, \"Okay, fine, I can turn this into a win for me. I can turn the Holy Spirit into just one more enemy trying to tell me what to do.\" But in truth, the Holy Spirit doesn't care what we do. He doesn't care whether you go to your reunion or not. He only cares about the love in your mind, whatever choice you make. Similarly, the ego doesn't care whether you go, either. It just wants you to be miserable and guilty, whether you go or stay home. So before deciding whether to go or not, ask the Holy Spirit to help you determine what is the kindest, most loving thing you could do in this situation. If not going to your reunion would be the gentler, more loving choice, you can be sure that the Holy Spirit will help you \"learn the lesson that you have to learn in another, more comfortable way.\" In the end, all we can do is attempt to listen to the Holy Spirit as best we can and not take it too seriously when we return to the ego. We know we're listening to the ego when we think the issues in our lives are serious, and to the Holy Spirit when we realize they are just silly. And the Holy Spirit can help you change your thinking about yourself and the world equally well, whether you're at your high school reunion or at home watching television."

A: Just as a clarification--in addition to Kenneth Wapnick, there is only one other psychologist on our staff.",
    "output": "Facilitating a Course group should be approached the same way you would approach any other role in your life-- primarily as a means of accepting the Atonement for yourself. In this sense, it would be a \"good teaching/learning process\" for you, as you suggest. Jesus tells us that the qualifications for being a teacher of God \"consist solely in this; somehow, somewhere he has made a deliberate choice in which he did not see his interests as apart from someone else's\" (M- 1.1:2). The Introduction to the manual for teachers as well as the first section in which this quote appears explain the Course's unique view of teaching and the student-teacher relationship. Our audio album \"What It Means to Be A Teacher of God\" can be particularly helpful in this context as well. The level of one's formal education is basically irrelevant. The Course presents a sophisticated thought system, and it is therefore helpful to have a good general grasp of its principles in order to structure discussions and answer questions from group members; but this does not require advanced academic status. Our books, audios, and videos are offered as study aids for this purpose, as well as to help students with their individual spiritual process. Finally, the only way you can know if you are doing the right thing is to try to recognize any ego involvement and then set that aside as best you can and ask the Holy Spirit for guidance. Our answer to #12 also addresses this issue."

    "text_input": "Q #969: A Course in Miracles says that it is just one expression of the \"universal curriculum,\" and allows for many other paths of equal validity. Many of these other paths, however, seem to",
    "output": "be in contradiction with the Course on at least one fundamental point--they understand human experience as playing some kind of creative role in a larger cosmic design. The Course, by contrast, teaches that our apparent existence in the world is merely a mistake to be corrected, rather than an experience with some kind of inherent value. Might it not be the case, when grasped through some higher-level understanding, that somehow both are true? That we have a purpose here, and yet don't have a purpose? Or could it be that our purpose here is merely to realize that we have no ultimate purpose as human beings? A: You are correct that A Course in Miracles stands in stark contrast to the many spiritual paths that view human existence as part of a cosmic design. Most of them begin with the premise that the world was made by God. The Course, on the other hand, tells us that this world \"was made as an attack on God ... to be a place where God could enter not\" (W-pII.3.2:1,4). Further, it lets us know that attacking God is not possible because God is Love and \"The opposite of love is fear, but what is all-encompassing can have no opposite\" (T-in.1:8). And so, according to the Course, this physical world and all that it contains--including our physical and psychological selves-- are merely the result of our dreaming a dream, the content of which is not true (T-28.II.7:1). Like a nighttime dream, the purpose of the experience we seem to be having here lies not within the dream itself, but rather within the mind that is dreaming it. Thus, we must return to our mind to find that purpose. The Course lets us know that our purpose will always be one of two things. Either we will be following the ego's mandate to use everything here to prove that our illusions about ourselves (that we are guilty and separate from God) are real (W-pI.55.5:2), or we will be following the Holy Spirit's guidance to find and extend the peace of God that still remains within ourselves (T-19.IV.3:6). The ego's purpose keeps us asleep with our guilt and fear firmly in place, while the Holy Spirit's purpose gradually leads us to awaken to our home in Heaven, which in truth we never left. Having made this world to serve the ego's purpose, the Course teaches us how to let it become our classroom for learning to follow the Holy Spirit instead. Indeed, as long as we believe that we are here, this world is the only classroom we have for learning this lesson. When we use it in this way, our human experience becomes quite valuable--not to God or the cosmos, but to our own process of spiritual maturation."

I'm having trouble seeing everyone as calling for love. I just feel overwhelmed--physically and mentally tired from trying to act from my higher mind and keep my ego out of the way. Because I am in a supervisory position, there are situations in which I am being asked to judge others. I believe these judgments are incorrect and won't actually help in getting the desired behavior. How should I approach this? A: That studying A Course in Miracles has made you want to be kinder and more loving is potentially very helpful. However, it sounds like the approach you are taking to achieve this admirable goal may actually be increasing the level of frustration and guilt you feel about your work. If this is the case, then you can be sure that you are not doing exactly what the Course advocates.",
    "output": "It may be helpful to consider the following passage from the text: \"You may wonder how you who are still bound to judgment can be asked to do that which requires no judgment of your own. The answer is very simple. The power of God, and not of you, engenders miracles. The miracle itself is but the witness that you have the power of God in you\" (T-14.X.6:7-10). Further explaining the futility of trying to achieve miracles on our own, Jesus says: \"The only judgment involved [in miracles] is the Holy Spirit's one division into two categories; one of love, and the other the call for love. You cannot safely make this division, for you are much too confused either to recognize love, or to believe that everything else is nothing but a call for love\" (T-14.X.7:1-2). In other words, the Course does not ask us to force ourselves to move beyond judgment. Rather, it asks us to connect with God's Love in our mind, which will radically and completely change our perception. To help us do that, it lets us know that in addition to the ego's voice of judgment, we also have another Teacher in our mind--the Voice of the Holy Spirit. When we listen to the ego (as most of us do nearly all the time), we automatically see and hear everything as an attack calling for attack. When we listen to the Holy Spirit, we automatically see and hear everything as either love or a call for love. Thus, when we follow the dictates of the ego, we cannot help but be judgmental and attacking. When we let the Holy Spirit guide us, we become kind and loving without any effort on our part. So again, the Course process is not about willing ourselves to see the world or other people differently. It is about using life as a classroom that will teach us that we would be better off if we changed internal teachers. The loving, nonjudgmental presence we become once we have made that change is neither the Course's nor our concern. What is our concern, is asking the Holy Spirit to hold our hand and help us watch ourselves without judgment as we continue to fill the roles that we are used to playing exclusively under the ego's guidance. In other words, we ask the Holy Spirit to help us watch our judgments, without judgment. In so doing, He will show us that our judgments are merely manifestations of our own fear of the Love of God. And every time we come to this realization about ourselves, we will recognize that the same fear must be what is motivating whomever we are currently judging. In this way, the Holy Spirit will gradually and gently teach us how to fill our roles in such a way that even as we judge someone in form (as your job requires you to do), the content will be love. It may seem to take quite some time until we really know how to do this and are able to do it consistently. This does not mean we are failing, or that we need to try harder. It simply tells us that we are still afraid of God's Love. If you recognize this struggle as both your own and the universal human condition, who could be a better choice than you to be a supervisor?"

    "text_input": "Q #971: After studying and practicing A Course in Miracles for over 20 years, my life has changed significantly in terms of how and where I live, how I spend my time, and how I approach conditions on this planet. Sometimes I feel so much love within that I think I will burst. However, since \"the world I see holds nothing that I want,\" I can't relate to most of what people do to stay busy. I often wonder \"What is the point?\" Increasingly, I feel bored, and except for  witnessing the occasional miracle, I don't see much reason to stay in the physical. Sometimes I have visions that fill me with joy that exceeds anything I've experienced in normal waking consciousness, but this is a rather recent development. What does the \"real world\" feel like? What does one \"do\" there? Am I maybe stuck somewhere in between?",
    "output": "It sounds like you may be superimposing other thought systems onto A Course in Miracles. The Course is not concerned with what we do--in this world or in any other. This is because Jesus knows that we are not in this world. We are merely dreaming that we are here because of our intense fear of awakening to find ourselves at home in God. Thus, Jesus sees this world and our experiences in it as nothing more than reflections of what goes on in our mind--not our mind as the person we think we are, but rather the decision-making part of our mind that exists outside of time and space. That mind has the power to choose between two teachers--the ego and the Holy Spirit. Which voice we listen to will determine whether we are filled with love or guilt and fear. And this will, obviously, profoundly change our experience of this dream we are having. So Jesus' goal in the Course is to help us shift our purpose from using the world to keep us ever more firmly planted in the ego's guilt, to using the world as a gentle classroom that constantly lessens our fear of our reality in Heaven. But before we can truly awaken, we must learn to listen exclusively to the Voice of the Holy Spirit--as Jesus demonstrated. At some point, once we have achieved this, we will consistently experience life through His eyes of forgiveness. Then we will be incapable of projecting guilt, and will be in a continual state of peace. The Course's symbol for this state of mind is the real world. Nothing external will have changed and we will not have gone anywhere. We will simply have changed the purpose of the dream we are having. The Course tells us that \"the world is the belief that love is impossible\" (T-8.IV.3:7). We could say then, that the real world is the knowledge that love exists, therefore the world is impossible. What will gradually take us from the state of mind we are currently in to the one symbolized by the real world is the mental shift that the Course refers to as the miracle. Like the real world, the miracle has nothing to do with any physical phenomenon. It is solely the shift in our mind from the ego's thought system of sin, guilt, and fear, to the Holy Spirit's thought of forgiveness. You mentioned \"experiencing the occasional miracle.\" Remember, though, that the only miracle the Course is concerned with is the change of teachers in your own mind. This is the key to solving the conundrum of why we would want to continue functioning like so-called normal people in this world, even though we know it holds nothing that we want. While it is true that nothing in the physical world can give us lasting peace or happiness, this world is the classroom in which we can learn that we threw away those qualities and that they still exist in our mind-- the mind we have worked so hard to obliterate from our awareness. And the way that we learn this is, again, by asking the Holy Spirit to help us watch all our thoughts and actions through His gentle eyes of forgiveness. This forgiveness is the closest thing we can experience to love in this world. It is not God's all-encompassing Love, but it is a reflection of it through forgiveness for ourselves and the world we think we see. This would not typically make us feel like we want to burst or are filled with visions of joy. Rather, it is generally more of a calm, inner smile that arises when the veils of our guilt and judgment fall away and our compassion emerges. The Course process, then, is not usually one of highs and lows, but rather of experiences of inner peace, and experiences of knowing that our fear caused us to abandon that peace. This is a process that can actually make it easier to relate to what others do to stay busy. Not because we relate to their activities, but because we understand both the fear and the unrealized longing to return home that motivates us all. And when such understanding occurs, we will no longer feel trapped in this world. We will derive all the comfort we need simply from being in the right place in our mind."

    "output": "There is no way of knowing this for sure, as most scripture scholars have concluded. It would not be surprising, however, if people were healed in Jesus' presence. In fact, it would be surprising if they were not. The basis in the Course for this is that all sickness is of the mind, specifically the guilt in the mind, and it has nothing to do with the body (see for example, M- 5.I,II). Physical symptoms are simply expressions in form of the mind's content. The message that would have been emanating from Jesus' mind to everyone is that their guilt is not justified, or in his own words in the Course: \"God's Son is guiltless, and in his innocence is his salvation\" (M-1.3:5). Simply stated, those who recognized and accepted this message would have let go of all their guilt and been healed accordingly. They would have responded to the invitation of his unconditional love for them to let go of all the barriers they had placed in its way--and that he was merely reflecting to them the love in their own minds that they had denied. This is the idea Jesus conveys in speaking of God's teachers as \"symbols of salvation,\" standing for the \"Alternative\" (M-5.III.2:4,6). Those who were able to get past their fear of accepting his love would have been healed, as is still and always will be the case. The discussion in #126 is also relevant to this topic."

The Introduction to the clarification of terms at the end of the manual says \"A universal theology is impossible, but a universal experience is not only possible but necessary\" (C-in.2:5). I feel my focus is on what I am not experiencing like not being angry, fearful, or guilty. I recognize not to use the ego thought system to judge or value anything in this world. Can you explain what is meant by a universal experience? A: The universal experience Jesus refers to is that all people would experience in some way that God loves them and has never condemned them. Earlier in the manual, he expressed it this way: \"God's Son is guiltless, and in his innocence is his salvation\" (M-1.3:5). Because of all the cultural, linguistic, and other differences among the people and nations in the world, it is unlikely that there could ever be a theological expression of this that would be accepted by everyone; but that does not matter in the end, Jesus is saying. All that matters is that we experience in whatever way we can, our innocence in God's sight, and that this innocence extends to everyone, without exception. This does not have to be experienced as a vision or a voice; it could simply be an awareness or a feeling. But Jesus teaches us that we should not try to force ourselves to have this",

This investment--coming from our identification with the ego--is the interference to our awareness of our eternal innocence; and therefore the focus of the Course's teachings and exercises is on forgiveness. For students who have accepted A Course in Miracles as their path, the practice of forgiveness is what will bring about the universal experience of love. Everyone will eventually arrive at the same place, but the means and paths may all differ."

    "text_input": "Q #974: I have recently begun therapy sessions for my obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) problem. Others in the class who share the same affliction readily tell me that the cause of OCD is a chemical imbalance in the brain. I recently voiced my opinion, hopefully in accordance with A Course in Miracles, that the cause of the distress exists in the mind and that not only do I have a brain, of course, but I also have a mind. I gave an analogy to explain that certain thoughts do trigger a host of chemical reactions in the body or brain. For example, the thought of sex (pleasure) can and does fire off chemical reactions in the brain that bring about arousal, but if I didn't have a mind such a thing would not occur at all. Several people shook their heads in disagreement, even the psychotherapist intern. I have a number of questions. Was I correct in my assessment, based on the principles of the Course? How should I handle myself during the classes while remaining true to the concepts of the Course? Should I remain silent about my ideas? Often people speak of \"body over will,\" meaning they see the body as the cause of strange, unwanted thoughts or tendencies over which they have no control. When they do, the psychiatrist usually suggests either medication or downplaying these strange, new thoughts by acknowledging their absurd meaning. Isn't the doctor's suggestion to use medication simply a preoccupation with the effect, which gives it power? On the other hand, I know the Course promotes medication for those overwhelmed with their symptoms. Still, I say to myself that it's just the mind doing what it's supposed to--making that ongoing experience of symptoms because the individual believes in it. However, I do find myself considering medication. My plan was to take it temporarily until I have a \"change of mind,\" but what if I become dependent on it while I am waiting around, so to speak, for a miracle to occur? I have asked the Holy Spirit so many times, whom do I need to forgive \"to see this differently,\" but I feel I have not heard an answer.  Recently, I was trying to use a lot of what the Course says on the dynamics of the mind for my own personal purposes with my condition. As a result, I decided to stop the workbook lessons for a while, because I was getting too distracted with my condition and I was feeling a little guilty for using the book in this way. But if the Course's purpose is healing, isn't this okay? I am thinking that I may be on a bit of an ego trip in the therapy sessions, because I am applying or \"projecting\" my Course-based beliefs onto the others, even when I'm in silence. I don't think they have ever heard of the Course. I feel at times, when I'm reading the text that I have to give up my ego completely in order to be finally rid of this disease. And that seems like too great a step. Can you comment?",
    "output": "Your observation that the cause of OCD is in the mind is in line with the teachings of the Course. From its perspective, the mind is always the cause and the body and its symptoms are always the effect (T-24.V.2:2; T-28.II.8:2-8; 9:1-3; T-28.III.5:1), despite the world's thinking to the contrary--the world and the body after all were made as defenses against remembering that we have a mind. However, the specific example you offered, that the thought of sex is the cause of the subsequent arousal in the body, although valid as far as it goes, does not really get to the heart of the Course's causal explanation. Thoughts about the body are still defenses against and covers for the deeper underlying cause in the mind. It is the mind's choice for separation and guilt that is the underlying cause of the world and the body and all its symptoms (T-27.VIII.7:2- 7; 8:1-7). And all of our defenses, whether they be physical or emotional conditions, addictions, routines, rituals, distractions, etc., are simply means we employ in our futile attempts to keep the underlying guilt and fear at bay, rather than looking at the guilt and fear with the Holy Spirit or Jesus so they can be undone. However, it not likely to be very helpful to yourself or to others in your therapy group who are not students of the Course to engage in this kind of discussion, for the Course offers a radical alternative to the thinking of the world that most people are not really open to. It is radical both in the sense that it goes to the root or source of all our problems in the mind and that it asks us to accept complete responsibility for all of our experiences (T-21.II.2:3-6), a step that most people are not yet ready to take. And so it is best to think of the Course simply as providing you with a framework for observing your own thoughts and feelings about what seems to be happening around you. But there is generally no need to share these observations with others, especially those who are not familiar with the Course's challenging principles. That could end up simply serving the ego's purpose of making you seem different and separate from everyone else. In contrast, the purpose of healing is served by being open to recognizing and accepting the ways in which we are all really the same. Acknowledging that you and the others in your therapy sessions share the same condition as well as the same need for help in coping with its effects can become a basis for experiencing joining with them. Remembering this purpose may also help you recognize what your ego is up to when you find yourself wanting to use the Course's principles to compare and judge the others for not understanding what you have begun to learn for yourself from the Course. A helpful way to think about participating in the therapy would be to remain open to what is being offered there as an explanation that does work and make sense at the level of the body. After all, unless you are ready to release completely your identification of yourself with your body, it is very likely that you will continue to operate under and accept the usefulness and practicality of most of the other \"laws\" of the body that the world accepts, such as the value of breathing and eating and drinking, wearing protective clothing depending on the weather, not stepping out in front of oncoming traffic, taking the stairs or an elevator rather than stepping off a balcony to get to the ground, etc. The point is, we all still operate within the belief system that the body is real and the outcomes could be disastrous at the bodily level if we tried to deny those beliefs by acting counter to them. Jesus makes it clear he is not asking us to deny the body (T-2.IV.3:8-13). And so part of our belief system includes believing that taking things into our body can be beneficial to our health, whether it be food, vitamins or medication. Yes, all of it ultimately is magic, the Course teaches, but there is also no hierarchy among illusions (T-26.VII.6), and no illusion is more or less acceptable, or more or less spiritual, than any other. We simply need to be honest with ourselves about what we personally believe will be helpful for us and then accept the particular form in which that help comes, not denying that we still need help. Your fear of becoming dependent on any form of magic, such as medication, is simply another trick of the ego to keep your mind in conflict. Whether medication may be helpful for you in your particular situation is something you would want to discuss with your doctor, leaving your thoughts about the Course's view of the relationship between the mind and the body outside the office. Perhaps most difficult to accept, while we still see ourselves as bodies, is that the Course's purpose is to help us heal our minds, not our bodies (T-28.II.11). While we keep our focus on the symptoms and their amelioration, we miss the opportunities for real healing. You say you have asked, without receiving an answer, for help in identifying whom you need to forgive, to see differently, so that you may experience a miracle and move beyond this condition. And you are thinking it must be about someone else. And so you don't see the answer that is staring you in the face! The place to begin is to learn to accept without judgment your OCD, recognizing that it is merely a defense you have unconsciously chosen to handle your fear. And at some level, it has worked in making the anxiety and conflict more manageable, which is always the ego's goal (T- 7.VIII.2:2-4). But rather than wishing the OCD away when, unconsciously, you really want it and are choosing it, it would be much more helpful to look at it and see what you can learn from it. For whenever the symptoms appear, this is simply an indication that you have become afraid of the limitless love that embraces us all and are feeling guilty and fearful of your desire and decision to be apart from that love. That is all that is ever happening and, if you can begin to recognize that, ever so slightly, you will begin to find the symptoms more tolerable, even if they are not going away. The helpful goal is to be able to look at the symptoms without judgment or fear, rather than change them. Gradually, the symptoms may then begin to lose their seeming power over you. And then, whether they go away or not will be much less your concern. Perhaps they will remain until you release your ego completely, perhaps not--it will matter little to you. But for as long as they remain, they can come to serve as simply a reminder that here's another opportunity to practice forgiveness, which is all the Holy Spirit ever asks of us. The Course does provide insight into the operation of the ego mind, and if you have found any of its clarification of the dynamics of the ego helpful in gaining greater understanding of the nature of your OCD, there is certainly nothing wrong with that--no need for any guilt here. However, understanding is not the same as healing, and only forgiveness--accepting all of what seems to be, without judgment or condemnation--heals (P-2.VI.5). So don't forget, as you engage in fascinating analyses of your mind's machinations, that there is another step to take. Q: #975: A Course in Miracles says there is an ego mind and a real Holy Spirit mind, which is part of God's Mind, where Heaven lies. What confuses me is this: How could the ego mind actually make us think with it instead of the one real mind that we all have? When something horrible happens to me, I try to remember to forgive. But instead I let all my anger out, and then feel terrible about it later. I blame the innocent mind because I don't think the evil mind has any strength at all compared to the real mind. I'm sure I'm misunderstanding something. Would you please clear this up for me? Also, I don't read the Course as much as I used to because I feel like I know everything about the Course now. I want to continue reading it, but I just don't have the motivation for it that I used to. A: Although the language of A Course in Miracles often makes it sound like we have two minds that are in opposition to each other, this is not really the case. In fact, what we have are two opposing thought systems in the separated mind. One, inspired by our misplaced ontological guilt, keeps us firmly planted in this dream of a physical existence filled with suffering. The other, inspired by our memory of our reality in Heaven, brings forgiveness to this dream and thus will gradually lead to our awakening. Neither thought system is true, for truth is impossible within a dream. However, dreams always reflect the thinking of the dreamer. Thus, the Course addresses us not as the individual we think we are within this dream, but rather as the dreamer of the dream. We could envision that dreamer as the mind's decision-maker, outside of time and space. It is always choosing between the loving truth of the Holy Spirit and the made-up guilt of the ego. The ego does not actually make us do anything. Rather, our own decision-maker chooses to listen to the ego. Once that decision is made, the ego appears to be running the show. But, as you stated, the ego itself has no power. The ego's apparent power comes only from our own choice to take it seriously and follow its dictates. Like the \"tiny, mad idea\" at which we remembered not to laugh, the ego is merely a tiny, mad thought system at which we continually remember not to laugh. Therefore the ego has no strength and is not evil. It is, once again, just the thought system of guilt--that demands punishment--which we grab onto whenever we become afraid (a state that most of us, unfortunately, live in the vast majority of the time). So, given that all our ego-driven thoughts and behaviors are really nothing more than reflections of our intense fear, feeling terrible for choosing them is not helpful. Indeed, feeling terrible only deepens the conviction that we are guilty, which is the very thing that led us to choose the ego in the first place. The way out of this vicious circle is to ask the Holy Spirit to help us watch our thoughts and actions through His loving, non-judgmental eyes. He will teach us that our inability to forgive another is a reflection of our belief that we are unforgivable. And as we learn that this is untrue, we will increasingly extend forgiveness rather than project attack and blame. That is the process that A Course in Miracles lays out for us. Ultimately, this process is the real Course--not the word-filled pages that comprise the book. Obviously, if the Course is our path, we should study it and learn to understand what it is saying. But there are no rules about how many times or how often we should read it. Sometimes not reading the Course is a defense against it, but, on the other hand, obsessively reading it can be a defense too. The important thing is to internalize its message and, in a sense, become the Course. The journey to achieving this will be different for all of us."

    "text_input": "Q #976: I have read that the goal of A Course in Miracles is not Heaven but the real world--the state of mind in which we have forgiven everything and everyone. That must include forgiveness for ourselves--forgiveness of the self-image (the ego or \"I\") that we made as part of our separation from God. But if we completely forgave the world and ourselves, wouldn't the ego disappear too and along with it, any kind of separateness that made reflection possible? Who would be left to notice that there was a real world (consisting only of forgiveness) if there were  no \"I\"? In other words, if I forgave the world totally, wouldn't it simply disappear? Is this why the Course says it is very easy for God \"to take the last step\"--because basically we will have already taken it?",
    "output": "One of the difficulties in trying to understand A Course in Miracles is that we use our linear brains to analyze a process that is not linear. Basically, the Course speaks to us as if the process of awakening consisted of discrete steps because that is the only way we can conceptualize it. But in reality, it does not work that way. And from our perspective, within this dream of separation, we cannot even begin to comprehend the final step or what it means to be fully awake. Jesus lets us know this is so when he states \"while you think that part of you is separate, the concept of a Oneness joined as One is meaningless\" (T-25.I.7:1). For this reason, the Course does not aim to get us back home. Rather, it strives to help us set up the conditions in our mind that will facilitate our return--conditions the Course refers to as the real world. That means returning our mind to a state of total forgiveness. Having taken back all our projections of guilt, we will be free from the fear that compelled us to fall asleep and will have no more need of this world. At that point, it will no longer matter to us whether we seem to be here or elsewhere because outer conditions will have no effect on our inner peace. The world will not have disappeared but its ability to affect us in any way will. What happens from there-- our awakening--will involve no effort on our part. And so, happily, we need not concern ourselves with it. Jesus states this symbolically by telling us that God will take this final step--a poetic way of putting our mind at ease about it (T-17.II.4:4-5). We could think of the real world as coming just before our total awakening and being similar to a lucid dream. While we will still experience ourselves as here in form, we will know that it is just a dream and that we are not the I we thought we were but rather the dreamer of the dream. This awareness will have allowed us to choose the dream's content. Thus, we will have chosen to make it one of love and forgiveness. We may still see all the cruelty and pain in this world, but we will see it through eyes that extend a continuous blessing. From that point, our awakening will be as easy and natural as waking up spontaneously after a good night of sleep. Q: #977: I'm totally new to A Course in Miracles. So far my understanding is that we are pretty much lost and confused, wandering in the fields of illusion but not aware of it. I gather that the Course is our guide out of these illusions or more precisely, a guide to help us become aware of them. Is that what the Course means by the Atonement? And with Atonement, can we experience the illusion at will without becoming lost and confused again. Can we enter the illusion simply to be at play in it or to provide guidance to others? Would individuals who can do this be the Ascended Masters I've read of elsewhere? A: It is tempting to try to understand A Course in Miracles by relating it to other spiritual teachings. But while the language of the Course does bear a resemblance to other spiritualities, its metaphysical and psychological teachings are unique. In the Course, Jesus gives us the following advice for getting in touch with God's Love in our mind, \"Do not bring with you one thought the past has taught, nor one belief you ever learned before from anything\" (W-pI.189.7:4). This same statement (though a rather tall order) provides an excellent guideline for approaching the Course itself. So, in order to answer your questions, we first need to take a brief look at what the Course actually teaches. It is true that, as a number of spiritual paths do, the Course tells us our entire physical existence is an illusion. The Course also informs us that this world came from an attack thought and therefore is not a nice place. Jesus refers to this as \"a dry and dusty world, where starved and thirsty creatures come to die\" (W-pII.13.5:1). Of course, Jesus wants us to know that we did not really come here at all. But we came here in our mind in an effort to escape the terror of the thought that we could separate from God and destroy His Love. Uniquely, the Course teaches that this world was the ego's answer to the conflicted and terrorizing belief that we had killed God and that God will somehow rise back up and strike us down in punishment. The ego lulled us to sleep with its promise that if we just accepted it as our teacher, we could banish all memory of God from our mind and thus be safe from such horror. But the Course further teaches that despite the ego's best effort, the memory of God and His Love remains in our mind. From the ego's perspective this memory of God's Love is an awful thing that, should we ever get close to it, will be its demise. And since we are almost fully identified with our egos, we think God's Love will be the end of us. However, the Course lets us know that there is another part of our mind. Jesus aims his message at the decision-making part of our mind that chose the ego. He reminds us that there is another internal Teacher still available to us --the Holy Spirit. He informs us that choosing the Holy Spirit instead of the ego will result not in our destruction, but rather in our gradually waking up and finding ourselves at home in Heaven, still safe within the Love of God. The Holy Spirit represents the memory of God's Love that we brought with us into this dream. If we turn to the Holy Spirit for help, He will transform any situation in our lives into a classroom in forgiveness. He does this by reminding us that we have not separated from God's Love nor have any of our brothers. As we begin to know this more and more, we will see that we all share the same attacking ego (that dreamed up this attacking world) and the same loving thoughts inspired by the Holy Spirit. Ultimately, we will recognize that there is nothing to forgive because we are not separate (from each other or from God) and so nothing has really happened. At that point we will know that this is all an illusion. This is what the Course means by Atonement--the undoing of the ego and the healing of the belief in separation (facilitated by our turning to the Holy Spirit for help). At the very end of the journey we will awaken and know this was all a dream. But the end of the journey is not our concern. Our task is to turn toward the Holy Spirit and let Him transform our life into a classroom. In so doing, we will become more loving and less filled with anxiety and pain. Increasingly, we will come to know that our body (physical and psychological) is nothing more than an idea in the mind that never left its source. As we recognize this, the love in our mind will naturally extend to all we encounter. The idea of entering this illusion to be at play does not make sense from Jesus' perspective. Only the ego thinks that there is fun to be had here. After all, if we knew we were at home in Heaven and perfectly safe, why would we go looking for fun in a world that was made to keep us feeling \"barren and separate\" (T-19.I.15:1)? Likewise, the Course does not concern itself with the concept of Ascended Masters. It does inform us that anytime you come from the Holy Spirit's Love instead of the ego's attack, you are a Teacher of God. But that does not make you ascended. It just makes you sane for however long your right-minded thinking lasts. Basically, anyone who thinks he or she is here has the same lesson to learn. We all desperately want to know that the separation never happened, we are not guilty, and we are just \"dreaming of exile but perfectly capable of awakening to reality\" (T-10.I.2:1). Somebody like Jesus would be an example of what the Course calls a Teacher of teachers (M- 26.2:2). Jesus seemed to be here but knew he was not. He only appeared in order to serve as a reminder of truth for the rest of the Sonship. But again, Jesus represents the end of the journey and that really is not our concern (other than to let him serve as our guide and inspiration). The Course helps us recognize that we are at the beginning of the journey. If we study it sincerely and with an open mind, we will realize that this is a journey worth taking and that there is a strong and loving hand we can hold along the way."

    "text_input": "Q #978: The manual for teachers section of A Course in Miracles discusses three different levels of relationships. But what specifically does Jesus means when he says that we \"learn\" from another person? For example, he says that the second level of relationship is a more sustained one in which two people enter into an intense relationship and then appear to separate. When he says that we learn from the other person, this does not necessarily mean that he or she verbally teaches us something, right? Does it mean that we learn to not project our guilt onto the person and that there is no separation between us? Does it mean, as Jesus implies earlier, that we learn not to see the other person as separate and then watch the artificial demarcations between us disappear? Or can it be any and all of these? A: Your understanding of what Jesus means by learning from another person is essentially correct. In form, the learning Jesus refers to could look many different ways. It is the content that he is concerned about. And that content will always consist of an internal shift from guilt to forgiveness, and from the perception of separate interests to the knowledge of shared interests. The Course teaches us that the purpose behind the Son of God's decision to dream up this world of separate bodies and separate interests was to have others onto whom we could project our guilt. To the ego, projecting our guilt is the one purpose of every relationship--regardless of the form the relationship takes. In the section of the manual for teachers to which you refer, Jesus emphasizes that just as the ego has one unified purpose for every relationship, so does the Holy Spirit. His purpose is to use all of our relationships (again, regardless of their form) as opportunities to help us shift our minds from the projection of guilt to the extension of love. Thus Jesus tells us, \"Each teaching-learning situation involves a different relationship at the beginning, although the ultimate goal is always the same; to make of the relationship a holy relationship, in which both can look upon the Son of God as sinless\" (M-3.1:2). Because our learning is really about a single shift from guilt to love, Jesus states that \"levels of teaching the universal course is a concept as meaningless in reality as is time\" (M-3.3:1). In other words, in reality there can be no levels of learning because there is only one lesson we need to",
    "output": "learn. But this is not our experience. And so Jesus returns to our level of experience and tells us that because \"each person involved [in a relationship] will learn the most that he can from the other person at that time\" we can speak of levels of teaching (M-3.4:1-2). Then he identifies the three types or levels of relationships (teaching-learning situations) as: apparently casual encounters, relationships that are more intense and circumscribed, and lifelong relationships in which the partners offer each other unlimited opportunities for learning. Again, the main point of this passage is that with the Holy Spirit as our internal Guide, everyone--from someone we see briefly on a bus, to a lifetime partner, to leaders we see on television, to deceased loved ones who exist only in our memories--offers us a teaching-learning opportunity. And this is so, because in reality we do not learn from the other person at all. We simply allow others, whether we perceive them as loving or hateful, to be the impetus for our decision to once again take the Holy Spirit's hand and remember that His Love still exists within our own mind. Therefore, other people are teachers for us not because of who they are or what they say or do, but because of a decision we make. This is why Jesus can confidently tell us that we cannot fail to find the Help we need (M-3.5:8)."

    "text_input": "Q #979: I am the managing director of a company with 290 sales consultants. While many of them do their jobs well, others produce unsatisfactory results. Some of the less successful consultants do things such as work only a few hours per day, fail to visit all their customers, fail to follow company rules, take many sick days, and even embezzle money or goods. These cases are often reported to me and I am expected to do something about them. Being a student of A Course in Miracles, in every case I ask myself what the appropriate action or non-action would be. Can you help me? A: The Course does not give us any specific guidance about what we should do on a behavioral level. It does, however, tell us the one thing we need to do in our mind to resolve every problem: remove the blocks to the awareness of love's presence (T-in.1:7). Again, it is important to remember that Jesus is not telling us what to do behaviorally. Rather, he is teaching us how to change our thinking. Once we have done this, our actions will automatically reflect the loving kindness of our thoughts.",
    "output": "Jesus speaks to us from the perspective of a healed mind, which knows that despite the apparent complexity of this world and of our lives, there is really only one problem and one solution. The problem is our choosing the ego's thought system of sin, guilt, and fear. The solution, therefore, is to turn away from the ego and choose instead the Holy Spirit's thought system of love and forgiveness. With this in mind, Jesus first has to make us aware that most of the time we listen to the ego, and that as long as we do so we will be unable to solve our perceived problems. He tells us \" ... in your state of mind, solution is impossible ... You are in conflict. Thus it must be clear you cannot answer anything at all ... \" (T-27.IV.2:2; T-27.IV.1:5-6). Then he lets us know where the true hope for solution lies: \"Therefore, God must have given you a way of reaching to another state of mind in which the answer is already there. Such is the holy instant. It is here that all your problems should be brought and left. Here they belong, for here their answer is. And where its answer is, a problem must be simple and be easily resolved\" (T-27.IV.2:3-7). The holy instant, of course, is the moment we choose the Holy Spirit as our internal Teacher-- something we want to do because \"Only the Holy Spirit can resolve conflict, because only the Holy Spirit is conflict-free. He perceives only what is true in your mind, and extends outward only to what is true in other minds\" (T-6.II.11: 8-9). What is true in our mind and in the minds of others is that the memory of God's Love remains there, and we are simultaneously terrified of it and desperate to remember it and awaken from this guilt-induced dream. Because of this conflicted state, we live our lives unconsciously at war with God. And since it is unconscious, the dynamics of this internal battle with God get projected outward onto other people and objects, which serve as substitutes for the ego's \"real\" enemy. This then explains what drives people to do the many unconscionable things they do in this world, such as lying to, and embezzling from their place of employment--a potent symbol of authority and therefore a worthy opponent to the ego. So, to answer your question, the first thing you would want to do when confronted with unethical behavior by your consultants is to recognize that their actions reflect \"the delusional [thought] system of those made mad by guilt\" (T-13.in.2:2). And since guilt caused their behavior in the first place, the answer lies in recognizing that they are not guilty. Of course, on the level of behavior, they are guilty--as are we all. But on the mind level, they have simply made the mistake of first misperceiving themselves as guilty and then acting in accordance with that misperception. So your job becomes to ask the Holy Spirit to help you see past the guilt in your own mind, so you can look at them without judgment and know the most helpful action to take. The tricky part is to be sure to genuinely ask the Holy Spirit for this help and not to prejudge on your own what a loving or \"spiritual\" person should do. As a director, paid to ensure the quality and integrity of your company, it is likely that the appropriate actions for you to take would be exactly the ones expected of anyone in your position. The difference would be the attitude with which you do them. Rather than doing them with anger or a desire to punish, you would do them in order to help your consultants stop hurting others and themselves."

    "text_input": "Q #980: The answer to #689 stated: \"We are asked to learn how to identify with the peace that is our true Identity as God's creation.\" Is peace our true Identity? Since I cannot find this in A Course in Miracles, can you explain it to me? Is not peace \"the condition of knowledge?\"",
    "output": "Both are correct. To say that \"peace is our true Identity\" is a way of emphasizing Jesus' point that nothing at all can change our natural state as God created us. As His creation, we share fully in His eternal peace. In that sense, it is part of our true Identity. On the other hand, within the dream of separation from God, we can believe that peace of mind is conditional on things being a certain way in our lives--that some conditions and circumstances can give us peace and some can take it away. That is one of the major misperceptions that Jesus is helping us to correct in his teachings and lessons on forgiveness. One way of avoiding the difficulties that language inevitably produces is to try to discern the content or the message--the point that Jesus is making in any given place in the Course--and then stay with that. Consistency in form is just about impossible. We are sorry if we caused some confusion."

    "text_input": "Q #981: There is a line in A Course in Miracles (T-25.VI.6:8): \"His special hate became his special love.\" This line appears to say that special love is something good or positive. I was  under the impression that for the Course \"special love\" was just as ego-driven, and therefore just as \"bad,\" as \"special hate.\"",
    "output": "This is a good example of how the Course sometimes gives a term a different meaning. In this case, \"special love\" is not referring to the specialness of the ego's love. It refers to a relationship transformed by the Holy Spirit. The passage tells us that the mind that chose hate and sin can choose love and grace. It thereby illustrates Jesus' teaching that the Holy Spirit uses what the ego made to condemn as a means of salvation. That is not to say that the ego's use of special love becomes \"good.\" As with everything of the ego, the special relationship is neither good nor bad. It merely reflects the mind's choice to identify with the thought of separation and the belief that illusion is real. When the mind chooses the Holy Spirit instead of the ego, the special love or hate relationship is reinterpreted by Him as a classroom to learn to undo the belief in separation. Thus the relationship becomes the means of salvation. The passage you refer to is further clarified in the text where we are told: \"In His function as Interpreter of what you made, the Holy Spirit uses special relationships, which you have chosen to support the ego, as learning experiences that point to truth. Under His teaching, every relationship becomes a lesson in love\" (T-15.V.4:5-6). When a relationship is transformed by the Holy Spirit and becomes a \"lesson in love,\" it is then \"special\" in a new sense. What makes it special is that its purpose has been changed. The ego's goal of using it to establish differences and make the separation real is changed to the Holy Spirit's curriculum of undoing separation through forgiveness. Forgiveness uncovers the exclusiveness of the ego's love that is used to defend specialness. While the ego bids us use special love to find one's own completion, the Holy Spirit teaches wholeness expressed in love that is inclusive, not special. Our goal is not to see the special relationship as positive or negative, nor to try not to have them, but to let the Holy Spirit use them to lead us beyond the ego's specialness to the reflection of love for all the Sonship that He represents."

    "text_input": "Q #982: I try to listen to the Holy Spirit all the time, and especially to ask Him to speak through me when I'm talking to others. I am often amazed at the gentle, encouraging words that come out of my mouth. I attribute this to just being willing to let Christ talk for me, not to any special abilities of my own. But last week, while I was talking to a new thought minister, something happened that bothered me. I told him that instead of encouraging his flock to listen to God for themselves, he tries to keep them dependent on him and to make them believe that they have to go through him to reach God. I spoke very authoritatively to him. Then, afterwards, I quickly apologized and ran out. This is bothering me because I wasn't teaching love. I barely knew this man! I did open up to spirit before speaking with him, so why would something so harsh come out? I guess I must have been projecting in some way, for some reason. Please give me your insight. A: First, we need to be clear that we cannot necessarily judge whether or not we are teaching love by the words we say. Jesus tells us in A Course in Miracles that what we hear when we listen to the Holy Spirit \"may indeed be quite startling\" (M-21.5:2). Thus, it is possible that our words could sound harsh or even outlandish, but still be motivated by an underlying intention to be loving and helpful. So, with nothing but a description of external events to go on, we could not say whether you were in fact being unkind to that man.",
    "output": "You are correct that whenever we say, feel, or think anything that is not an extension of love, we are projecting. If that is indeed what you were doing in that instant, we could only guess the reasons why. Without knowing more about you, we could only speculate why you might have been triggered at that specific moment, by that particular individual. But it might be helpful to ponder the following statement from the Course: \"projection, occurs when you believe that some emptiness or lack exists in you, and that you can fill it with your own ideas instead of truth\" (T- 2.I.1:7). In other words, if you were attacking him, the chances are that he reminded you of something of which you accuse yourself. (This does not necessarily mean that you accuse yourself of exactly what you reprimanded him for, though this could be the case.) Then, before that guilt came to consciousness, your ego jumped in and said, \"Ah, I know how to get rid of this guilt. I'll focus instead on what he is doing wrong.\" As the Course says, \"Projection makes perception ... you attacked your brother, because you saw in him a shadow figure in your private world [your mind]. And thus it is you must attack yourself first, for what you attack is not in others. Its only reality is in your own mind ... \" (T-13.V.3:5-8). If guilt led to the incident in the first place, rather than continuing to feel guilty about it, it would be more helpful to instead use it as a valuable source of information. Because \"What is not love is always fear, and nothing else\" (T-15.X.4:5), you could recognize that, despite your frequently successful attempts to connect with the Holy Spirit's Love, part of your mind is still fearful. In fact, as long as we retain any belief in the reality of this world and our individual existence within it, a part of our mind will remain afraid. It is only at the very end of our spiritual journey that we will be entirely guilt free and consistently filled with love. Until then, it is virtually inevitable that we will have both right-minded moments in which we extend love, and wrong- minded moments in which we project guilt. The fact that you recognize that you may have projected guilt, and have a sincere desire not to do so, is very helpful. At this point, you could simply stop right there and ask the Holy Spirit to help you look at the incident you described (and any future situations which trigger your guilt) through His compassionate, non-judgmental eyes-- allowing Him to give the same gentle encouragement to you that you have felt Him help you direct toward others."

    "text_input": "Q #983: Is there any way we can learn knowledge without reading it from a book or from any other \"normal\" means? If there is, how can we get in touch with it? The information I want to learn is about the body and diet. The darkness in my mind has almost gone, and I feel that my body needs to be completely refreshed for me to feel the full benefits of it. I know that this isn't in line with the teachings of A Course in Miracles; however, I am convinced that it should be. So before I embark on a journey of reading a lot of books about nutrition and many other things; is there a shortcut to this knowledge already stored in the mind? A: Within this world, there are certainly many ways to learn about such things as how to take optimal care of our bodies. However, the Course gives us a shortcut to knowledge that does not come from within this world. Its purpose is to teach us that we made up this world and to return us to the part of our mind that contains the guilt that compelled us to do so in the first place. Jesus seeks to help us remove the fear that we have foolishly attempted to obscure by inventing bodies and sickness. This is why he tells us that \"Sickness is a defense against the truth\" (W-",
    "output": "pI.136). The same could be said of anything else that reinforces our experience of being separate bodies living a physical existence. Jesus also lets us know that \"Health is the result of relinquishing all attempts to use the body lovelessly. Health is the beginning of the proper perspective on life under the guidance of the one Teacher Who knows what life is, being the Voice for Life Itself\" (T-8.VIII.9:9-10). In other words, from Jesus' healed perspective, neither sickness nor health is about bodies. The state of our body simply reflects what we have chosen to do with our mind. It is important to remember that this is a choice we make on a level of the mind of which we are not aware--as decision makers outside of time and space. Thus, making a different choice requires us to get in touch with a new internal Teacher--the Holy Spirit. He will gently awaken us to the power of our mind in a way that allows us to access it without becoming afraid. Of course, this is a process, and it is only at the very end of our spiritual journey that we will truly understand that our bodies are nothing more than puppets carrying out the dictates of our mind. Until then, while we believe that we are here, we should certainly do whatever we think will keep our bodies healthy and safe. Not doing so usually only serves to reinforce guilt and to allow the body to become even more of a distraction than it already is. At the same time, it is helpful to recognize that in a sense, we are fighting a losing battle. We made bodies to break down, feel pain, and die. We may be able to delay these things, but eventually they will happen. So if in fact we needed a \"completely refreshed\" body in order to feel the full benefits of a healed mind, it would mean that the benefits of a healed mind were fleeting. Fortunately, this is not the case. The state of our mind is in no way dependent upon the state of our body. Indeed, once our mind is fully healed, the state of our body becomes irrelevant. We could be nailed to a cross, or lying in bed, our bodies riddled with cancer, and still be completely at peace. After all, what could be more peaceful than knowing that that which is being threatened is unreal and has nothing to do with us? Simply trusting that such a state is possible and approaching life as a classroom to help us get there is the shortcut Jesus has given us to achieving true knowledge."

    "text_input": "Q #984: I read your answer to a question a couple of years ago about grief. It's difficult for me to wrap my mind around what you had to say. I'd like to ask again, using my real life situation. My only child, a young woman, has been diagnosed with \"final stage\" cancer. I am praying to see beyond these appearances to her perfect Self in Christ and most often I can do that. But even though she is not her body, should her body cease to exist in this illusory world, how can I deal with the loss? I cannot seem to find peace with this situation. The thought of a world without my child seems impossible. I trust A Course in Miracles but sometimes find its abstractions difficult. Can you help me understand, please? A: Your words express very poignantly your feelings of fear and pain and grief over your daughter. Such personal losses are very difficult to look at and accept from within the world's thought system, for it can feel as if our hearts are being torn apart and it can seem that nothing is able to offer any real comfort. And it is essential to the healing process that you do not try to deny these feelings, or to attempt to make them go away, or to cover them over with \"healing\" spiritual platitudes. But you can at least begin to step back from them and recognize that they are not who you are.",
    "output": "You see, the ego thought system may be one of pain and loss and grief (T-13.IX.2:3), but we are not our egos. Now so long as we remain identified with its tenets of separation and limitation, these feelings will continue to be a significant part of our experience. But to the degree that you are able to begin to observe them without using them to define yourself, you may begin to experience some relief. Yet there will likely be a great deal of resistance to disidentifying with them, for who will you be if you are not a grieving mother faced with the loss of her daughter? You say that you have prayed to see beyond appearances to your daughter's perfect Self in Christ, beyond her body. But have you considered that you too, in your reality, are perfect in Christ, and not your body? It seems that you are making that difference real, that somehow she, despite illness, is perfect, but that you remain a body that can be abandoned by her death. And it is a basic teaching of the Course that we can only ever see another as we have first seen ourselves (e.g., T-8.VII.5:1-4; T-15.V.6:5-6). Now any real healing will come, not from determining how to make you see both your daughter and yourself as perfect, but rather from uncovering all the reasons why you would choose to see yourself as a limited body that can experience loss and pain, and then forgiving yourself for those choices. The ego would want you to believe your pain is all the result of what has happened with your daughter, and the intensity of your feelings would seem to argue convincingly that that is the case. But Jesus in his course is very gently telling you, as he is telling all his students, that we are wrong. He is trying to help us see that all our feelings of grief and pain and loss come simply from choosing to embrace the thought of separation, which, were it true, would mean quite literally that we are now separate from love (T-16.V.4:4). And that is a painful loss beyond all words, triggering a grief that we can not even begin to imagine. And our special love relationships are the screens on to which we project such feelings, so that we are never in touch with their real source in the mind. Instead, it seems that our special love relationships prove that we are obviously incomplete and that genuine love and happiness lie outside ourselves in others (T-29.VII.2,6). And our relationships with our families and our loved ones provide powerful demonstrations of this ego \"truth.\" Jesus is asking only one thing of us with respect to our feelings: do not try to justify them based on our interpretation of what we believe is happening or has happened. For that is where we are mistaken. If we insist that our interpretation is right, we will never be able to hear the alternative interpretation that Jesus is offering us. And so the first question we may wish to ask ourselves is, \"Am I willing to consider that I may be wrong?\" (T-30.I.9,10). If the answer is no, that's okay, for Jesus always remains available, waiting patiently, until we are willing to reconsider (T-8.IV.6:3-5). The release of such intense feelings, projected onto your daughter, may happen only gradually over time, as a process. But if you can allow yourself even brief glimpses of the love and the truth that lie within, experienced in those moments when you join with Jesus in looking gently and nonjudgmentally at what you have made real in your mind, you will begin to understand that you have indeed found your ultimate path out of the pain and grief. But above all else, be gentle with yourself in the process. For Jesus is only trying to persuade all of us that we are deserving of love and, regardless of what seems to be happening in our lives and in the world around us, nothing but our own decision can make us feel bereft of it (T-4.IV.3)."

I thought it was the Course that saves the most time. Is that a misprint or a grammatical error or am I missing something? \"They merely save time\" seems to be referring to all the other forms out there.",
    "output": "You are correct, the manual does say that the many forms of the universal course save time. The reason for this is that the universal course is one of content, not form, and time belongs to the world of form. When the mind decides to accept the universal truth that the separation never happened, and God's one Son is innocent, the concept of time disappears. That is how it is \"saved.\" Also, students of A Course in Miracles \"save time\" by not wasting it in pursuit of other forms that are very helpful, but are not their path: \"You are not making use of the course if you insist on using means which have served others well, neglecting what was made for you\" (T- 18.VII.6:5). We escape the laws of time through the practice of forgiveness by returning to the thought in the mind that is outside of time. The ego's perception of grievances and its use of projection are concepts bound by time. The Holy Spirit's perception is a view from beyond time's boundaries because it perceives only two timeless thoughts: the separation that never happened, and reality that never changed. Learning to see with His vision thus removes all experience from the chains of time. That is the Course's \"fast track.\" It is not a linear process. Time is meaningless in the instant the mind chooses the Holy Spirit, regardless of the way time was used on the path that led to the choice. It is only the mind's choice (content) that matters. Each choice against the ego is what saves time and saves us from time."

    "text_input": "Q #986: I've begun to understand the relationship between guilt, projection, and blame. Since beginning to see this mechanism, two things have happened. One is that I've become incredibly irritable. I sometimes seem to be projecting a low level of guilt all over everyone and everything, which I then experience as a constant buzz of irritation. I can stand back and listen to the litany of blame (this is too loud, he's chewing funny, she should just shut up, etc.) and I usually say \"Jesus please join with me in looking at this situation. I can't stand feeling this way.\" But the whole thing is sometimes so exhausting I feel like I'm just going to jump out of my skin. I have a hard time smiling at it when it reaches that sort of crescendo. Although, I will say that if I can tell my husband about what's going on when this is happening, and just sit with it, it passes. The other thing that's happening is that I've become afraid something bad is going to happen to my son. It's like the ego is saying \"well, since you don't seem to be worried that something bad will happen to you, how about if we consider punishing you by hurting your child.\" It scares me! I know, intellectually, that this is just my guilt and my fear of God and of love. I repeat to myself \"I am at home, fear is the stranger here.\" I try focusing on the Atonement. I also try asking for Jesus or the Holy Spirit to join with me and help me understand my innocence. Do you have any other tips for dealing with all this? A: Your heightened sense of irritation and fear sounds like the normal reaction of an ego threatened by the message of A Course in Miracles. As you stated, your understanding of the dynamics of guilt and projection seems to have led you to project guilt in an even more obvious way. Meanwhile, the apparent easing of your fears about yourself has led you to focus your fear on an even more potent subject than your own body--the body of your child. Obviously, your",
    "output": "ego knows its game could be up and it is fighting to maintain its hold on you. It sounds as if you have a clear understanding of this. That brings you to what is, at some point, virtually every Course student's million dollar question: Now that I know why I am in pain, how do I get out of it? Here is the good news: You came very close to answering your own question! You stated that when you tell your husband what is happening and just sit with it, it passes. Reading between the lines, it would seem from your statement that your husband does not express judgment about what you describe to him. Rather, he simply listens to you and allows you to be with your feelings. A slight alteration in your internal process would make this same comforting companionship available in your own mind. Instead of deciding that you should focus on the Atonement or your innocence, try simply asking the Holy Spirit to help you look at your pain without judgment. Come to Him without any preconceived ideas about how your conflict should be solved. He knows that when we are in the midst of pain, Atonement and innocence generally feel like distant and even aggravating intellectual concepts. He recognizes that we cannot jump from where we are directly into the Arms of God. Instead, we need to gradually learn that all our projecting of guilt has \"caused nothing, and had no effects\" (T-28.II.11:7). Through the Holy Spirit's eyes, we slowly discover that not only does all the ego's kicking and screaming have no effect on reality, but in fact, it need not even affect us. This is where Jesus is taking us when he urges us to \"be more aware of this quiet center of the storm than all its raging activity\" (T- 18.VII.8:2). Indeed, watching the ego without justifying it or feeling guilty about it is the one thing it cannot use to further its own cause. In contrast, struggling against the ego in order to achieve lofty spiritual goals can fan the ego's flames just as effectively as funny chewing."

    "text_input": "Q #987: Are Gloria and Kenneth Wapnick married? If they are married, doesn't this mean that they still have egos?",
    "output": "To answer your first question: Yes, they are married. Your second question seems to imply a couple of misunderstandings involving assumptions about what we can tell about others from the external facts of their lives, and possibly about what is required to be a teacher of A Course in Miracles. Many students of the Course have erroneously reached the conclusion that marriage--or even intimate relationships of any kind--is a form of special relationship and that therefore it is more spiritually advanced not to be in them. However, this is absolutely not what Jesus is trying to teach us in his course. He is not concerned with the form of our relationships. After all, how could he be concerned with something that he knows is not really happening? As Course students, we could avoid a lot of errors if we remembered this central teaching: \"All [our] time [here] is spent in dreaming\" (T-18.II.5:12). In other words, nothing is actually happening here. So Jesus seeks to help us return to where the action is: our minds. He defines the special relationship as our attempt to get from outside ourselves that which we think we lack. It is an effort to find a substitute for God's Love, which we think we have destroyed and lost forever. Note that this could be a description of our relationship with another person, but it could just as easily describe our relationship with such things as food, air, and water. And Jesus certainly is not telling us to stop breathing (nor to feel guilty about it). Rather, he wants us to gradually recognize that the special relationships we seem to have within this world are but reflections of the one special relationship we have with the dream itself. He would have us learn that we do not need to continue dreaming of exile because our guilt is made up. The process he gives us for achieving this goal involves changing internal teachers--dropping the ego's hand and taking the Holy Spirit's. He tells us that, \"In His function as Interpreter of what you made, the Holy Spirit uses special relationships, which you have chosen to support the ego, as learning experiences that point to truth. Under His teaching, every relationship becomes a lesson in love\" (T-15.V.4:5-6). And so any relationship may be special or holy. What makes them one or the other is not the form our relationships take, but simply whether we use them to project guilt or to extend love. And again, this is an internal choice and not something we could judge about another person. Furthermore, as we attempt to follow Jesus' curriculum, most of us will go back and forth between a right-minded and a wrong-minded purpose in all our relationships, as long as any guilt or fear remains in our mind. In case you asked your question because you think that a teacher needs to be ego free in order to teach the Course, remember the statement from the manual that \"A teacher of God is anyone who chooses to be one. His qualifications consist solely in this; somehow, somewhere he has made a deliberate choice in which he did not see his interests as apart from someone else's\" (M- 1.1:1-2). So, rather than focusing on whether a teacher is ego free (which again, we could never know about another person), it is much more useful to ask ourselves whether someone's teaching triggers our guilt or helps us to feel more loving. Ultimately, we need not concern ourselves with where others are in their process or even with where we are in ours. What matters is whether we are choosing love now."

    "text_input": "Q #988: I have a friend who is being \"cleared\" of her karmas and is having what I consider to be great results, such as having the ability to heal others. Could you please comment on what Jesus' message might be about this? Would A Course in Miracles consider this subject to be beyond its scope?",
    "output": "Your question raises two issues: what is the Course perspective on karma, and where does it stand on being able to heal another. You are correct that neither of these topics is the focus of the Course. So let us explore why this is so. Perhaps the most cogent description of Jesus' stance on healing can be found in the following passage: \"Whom you attack you cannot want to heal. And whom you would have healed must be the one you chose to be protected from attack. And what is this decision but the choice whether to see him through the body's eyes, or let him be revealed to you through vision? How this decision leads to its effects is not your problem. But what you want to see must be your choice. This is a course in cause and not effect\" (T-21.VII.7:3-8). We will examine the last sentence of that passage first: \"This is a course in cause and not in effect.\" By cause, Jesus means the mind--specifically the part of our mind, which has the power to choose to listen to either the ego or the Holy Spirit. When we listen to the ego (which tells us we exist at God's expense), our mind fills with guilt and fear, causing us to project anger and attack. This is the dynamic that compelled us to fall asleep and dream up a world of separate bodies in the first place--our unfortunate response to the ego's cunning proclamation that we could remove all the guilt from our mind if only we had bodies onto which we could project it. By effect, Jesus means the world, which is nothing more than a nightmare we are having because we continually choose to dream with the ego rather than awaken with the Holy Spirit. To Jesus, then, physical sickness is simply one more element of our dream, which reflects the guilt in our mind. Thus, since sickness is but an effect, Jesus and his course are not concerned with physical healing. Rather he wants to help us make the shift in our mind that \"takes away the guilt that makes the sickness possible\" (W-pI.140.4:5). This is the shift Jesus refers to in the passage quoted above when he speaks of the choice whether to see another \"through the body's eyes\" (meaning the guilty eyes of the ego) or by letting him be \"revealed through vision\" (meaning the loving vision of the Holy Spirit). When we choose the body's eyes, we will always have an underlying motive of attack. When we look with the Holy Spirit, we will see the innocence we share with our brother that remains hidden in the mind, beyond our seemingly separate physical identities. This will automatically lead us to extend love, thus protecting our brother from attack by rejecting rather than reinforcing his guilty perception of himself. Jesus tells us that how this decision leads to its effects is not our problem. But making this choice is. In other words, we do not need to worry about how our state of mind gets reflected in this dream. We need only concern ourselves with changing internal teachers so that we can experience the Holy Spirit's Love regardless of what appears to be happening in the physical world. When we achieve that, we will be able to be with others whose bodies appear to be sick and know that their physical illness can have no effect on the reality of who they are. There may be times when our knowledge that they are not guilty allows others to release the fear that created their need for physical symptoms. There will also surely be times when both their fear and their illness seem to remain unaffected by our love. Again, this is not our concern. Our concern is only with our own mind and the thought system with which we choose to align it. (For more about this, see Chapter 3 of the Song of Prayer supplement.) This focus on the present state of our mind is why the Course does not address karma. From Jesus' perspective, what we did lifetimes ago or five minutes ago is all the same--part of a dream from which we need to awaken. What matters is not our past, but the internal teacher we are choosing right now. This does not, however, negate the fact that dealing with past life issues could be very useful for some people. And if your friend has found a process that facilitates her letting go of guilt, then this is very helpful. But from a Course perspective, this is not really due to her karma being cleared. Instead, it is the result of her finding a symbol that finally allowed her to accept forgiveness and let it wash away the imagined guilt for her imagined sins of her imagined past."

Also, being married since 1978, I have become celibate with my wife's blessing. I was wondering if anyone else has changed their diet and other forms of lifestyle?",
    "output": "We have not run across this very often, as the focus of the Course's teachings is exclusively on changing our thinking--it says nothing about behavior. However, in general, people do find themselves becoming more compassionate as they practice forgiveness over a period of time and get in touch with the inner pain they realize everyone else shares with them. This leads them to be less judgmental of themselves and others. The primary focus of the Course's teachings is on changing the purpose for which we use the body and the world, which means becoming aware of whether we have chosen the ego or Jesus as our teacher. Since Jesus recognizes the fundamental unreality of the body and the world, our lifestyle and the food we choose to eat is essentially irrelevant to him. His concern is only with our minds--whether our thoughts reflect the ego's doctrine of separate interests or his doctrine of shared interests. He therefore teaches us to see the world as a classroom in which everything of the body becomes a means of learning that we all share the same wrong mind, the same right mind and the same decision-making power to choose between them, and that our common purpose is to awaken from the dream of separation. This lesson can be learned whether you are a vegetarian or not, whether you are celibate or not. Since the world is illusory, nothing in it is inherently holy or unholy--holiness is associated only with our mind's choice to share the Holy Spirit's perception of all things. For further discussion of these issues, you may wish to look at Questions #120, #170, #247, #430, and #448."

    "text_input": "Q #990: It seems to me that the more deeply I move into A Course in Miracles, the less I feel in touch with God. Here my ego has trapped my spirit in a body and I spend my life choosing between higher-self and lower-self reactions to supposed others, while God is blissfully unaware of what I believe is my existence. So God becomes more and more an amorphous and theoretical concept to me. There are even periods when I entertain the thought that there is no God. What keeps me going is that I cannot see how the Course could come from any being of this world. I also cannot find any better explanation for the craziness of this world or \"existence,\" or any better path than the Course for dealing with it. Part of me knows that all of this could just be one great--and I wish, last ditch--ego defense to stop me from moving through the Course. Do you have any ideas about this paradox and how it can best be dealt with? A: While painful, your sense that you are feeling less in touch with God is a normal and perhaps even critical stage of working with the Course. After all, the Course is telling us that the God most of us grew up with does not exist. Unlike the God of the Bible, the Course's God \"does not know of separation\" [i.e., this world] (P-2.VII.1:11). Fortunately, however, Jesus' message does not end there. His real goal is to help us to understand that \"nowhere does the Father end, the Son begin as something separate from Him\" (W-pI.132.12:4). We remain as a \"Oneness joined as One ... at home in God, dreaming of exile\" (T-25.1.7:1; T-10.I.2:1). Thus, God is not unaware of us because He is ignorant or uncaring. He does not know about us because we--as the separated beings we think we are--do not exist. This is our dream not His. Despite its Christian language, which refers to God as a being with thoughts and feelings, the Course's underlying message is that God is not a being and neither are we. To our sleeping mind, under the tutelage of the ego, this concept is both incomprehensible and very threatening. So the ego acts quickly to annihilate this threat and maintain its grip on us. It perverts the Course's potentially mind-altering message by telling us, \"You see, you thought God was angry at you.",
    "output": "But it's even worse than that. He doesn't even care about you at all!\" This defense lets us remain firmly rooted in this dream with our one-or-the-other mentality perfectly intact. However, as you stated in your question, there is a part of our mind that recognizes a loving presence in the Course, which could not possibly have come from within the thought system of this world. And part of us knows that if we recognize something, it must be within us. We grasp--perhaps faintly at times--that there is something within us to which we long to return. But Jesus knows that although we long desperately to feel God's all-encompassing Love, we cannot understand it or make sense of it from within this dream. And so he does not attempt to teach us what God or His Love is. Rather, he focuses on teaching us what they are not. He does not ask us to believe in God. Rather he strives to help us gradually come to know God by letting forgiveness take the place of all the guilty illusions that block His Love from our awareness. Perhaps Jesus' best summation of this point comes in the pamphlet Psychotherapy: Purpose, Process and Practice. In the following passage, Jesus is referring specifically to psychotherapy. But what he says reveals his perspective on the entire spiritual journey that he asks us to take. \"It would be unfair indeed if belief in God were necessary ... Nor is belief in God a really meaningful concept, for God can be but known. Belief implies that unbelief is possible, but knowledge of God has no true opposite. Not to know God is to have no knowledge, and it is to this that all unforgiveness leads. And without knowledge one can have only belief\" (P-2.II.4:3- 7). And so, happily, conflicted thoughts about the existence of God, and confusion about what God is, are neither personal shortcomings nor impediments to our progress as students of the Course. The best approach is to simply watch them make their inevitable appearance as we continue on our journey of questioning every value that we hold (T-24.in.2:1). For a related discussion about the nature of God according to A Course in Miracles, please see #625."

    "text_input": "Q #991: Once forgiveness is complete, and we have regained the awareness of our oneness with God that we never really lost, will we retain our individualized memories of the ego-based illusion that we decided against? Does union differentiate, or are we destined to become a holy thought in God's mind with perfect communion with the Sonship? A: Choosing the separation means deciding against oneness in favor of the ego.",
    "output": "Oneness/union and separation/differentiation are mutually exclusive thoughts and cannot be entertained by the mind at the same time. Thus, when we remember our oneness with God, we will not retain a memory of the ego identity of separation. As we are frequently reminded in A Course in Miracles, the problem of separation is one of forgetting the truth of our identity as God's one Son: \"Here is your promise never to allow union to call you out of separation; the great amnesia in which the memory of God seems quite forgotten ... \" (T-19.IV-D.3:4). The solution lies in forgetting the separation and remembering the truth of oneness. By its very nature, union does not separate or differentiate. Differentiation is the essence of duality, at the expense of oneness. It is expressed in individuality/specialness, which cannot be maintained when oneness is chosen. Just as oneness is forgotten when the choice is made to identify with the ego, the illusion of individuality will be forgotten when oneness is chosen and the Atonement is complete. Fear of accepting our oneness with God underlies the intense attachment to specialness that keeps oneness forgotten. The Holy Spirit's curriculum of forgiveness takes into account our fear of oneness and attachment to specialness by transforming the multitude of differences the ego made to separate, into a classroom to learn that \"the separation never occurred\" (T-6.II.10:7). This answers the last part of your question; we already are a thought in the Mind of God; a Mind we have never left. We are destined only to remember that this is who we truly are, and to forget the illusion of being anything else. Forgiveness is the path that makes this possible. It is the process of seeing every grievance as a projection of the guilt that accompanies the mind's decision to choose separation rather than oneness. Each time we are willing to look at grievances in this way, our identity as minds is strengthened/ remembered and belief in the body is diminished/forgotten. As Jesus tells us in the workbook: \"It is as sure that those who hold grievances will forget who they are, as it is certain that those who forgive will remember\" (W-pI.68.3:3). While fear of oneness remains, we take the small steps of forgiveness in which the pain and anguish of holding grievances disappears and fear is lessened. We take these small steps at a \"gentle pace\" until we are ready for oneness. As Jesus assures us in the text: \"Fear not that you will be abruptly lifted up and hurled into reality. Time is kind, and if you use it on behalf of reality, it will keep gentle pace with you in your transition\" (T-16.VI.8:1-2). These kind words deflate the ego's argument that \"fear of losing our individual identity\" is just cause for not accepting Jesus' loving message. In the end, everything will be forgotten, for now it is enough that we be willing to forget one grievance at a time through forgiveness."

    "text_input": "Q #992: I have a question related to Lesson 16. It says \"I have no neutral thoughts\" and that \"Every thought you have contributes to truth or to illusion.\" When I began the first practice period, I started to feel intense fear that every thought I have contributes to the awfulness I perceive in this world, to making things worse instead of better, and to furthering the illusion. I am certainly not adept at controlling the content of my thoughts--likely I'm not even aware of many of my thoughts. I guess that's what's frightening me--since I'm not aware of many of my own thoughts, let alone of their content, I don't know what they are causing! And I just wanted to stop thinking, but I couldn't. I suppose this is an example of my self-protective ego in action? Until today, I had not experienced fear like this in relation to A Course in Miracles. In fact, I have been finding in it a completeness or wholeness that no other spiritual road I have explored--as much as they contributed to my spiritual growth--seemed to possess. I need some advice. A: You are absolutely right that this is an example of your ego trying to preserve itself. Your description makes it clear that Lesson 16 brought up guilt for you, which in turn led to feelings of intense fear. We can think of the ego's relationship with guilt as being similar to the body's relationship to oxygen--take away guilt and the ego is finished. So the ego will do anything it can to ensure itself a steady supply of guilt. The Course tells us that \"The ego will attack your motives as soon as they become clearly out of accord with its perception of you. This is when it will shift abruptly from suspiciousness to viciousness, since its uncertainty is increased\" (T-",
    "output": "9.VII.4:6-7). It sounds like, for whatever reason, Lesson 16 was the point in your study of the Course at which your ego decided to make that shift--instantly seeming to turn what had been a source of spiritual inspiration into a source of guilt. To further complicate matters, one of the ego's key principles, repeated in various forms throughout the Course, is that guilt demands punishment. And so you fell into a trap that nearly every Course student's ego sets at some point. Having become aware of the darkness in your mind, you took the ego seriously as it told you that this newly-discovered darkness proves its evaluation of you as a vicious destroyer of Heaven (and, by implication, justified in your guilt and deserving of punishment). However, in that very lesson, Jesus lets us know that despite the seeming power of our thoughts, we have not destroyed Heaven. He tells us that they give rise to the perception of a whole world (W-pI.16.2:2). In other words, they do not actually make a world; they merely cause us to think one exists. Our thoughts are not neutral because they have the power to either keep us asleep (if we choose the ego's thoughts), or lead us to awakening (if we think with the Holy Spirit). Within this dream, the choice we make will seem to bring us either peace or war. But this has no effect on reality, which is entirely outside of this dream. Thus, we do not need to feel guilty about the effects of our thoughts on the external world because in reality there is no external world. Furthermore, since love can have no opposite, our attack is not real either. As the Course says, \"if all condemnation is unreal, and it must be unreal since it is a form of attack, then it can have no results\" (T-8.VII.15:8). So when we find ourselves worrying about the results of our thoughts, we do not need to stop thinking (which, as you found out, is impossible). Rather, we need simply recognize that we have once again grabbed the ego's hand and encountered the pain that comes from placing value in its raucous shrieking. Then we can ask the Holy Spirit to help us discern the one and only thing we need ever know about the content of our thoughts--whether they reflect love or are calls for it (T-14.X.7:1). Better still, regardless of the answer to that question, we can ask Him to help us respond to our own thoughts, be they fearful or loving, with love--the only response that is ever justified or helpful."

    "text_input": "Q #993: In #48 you state that \"A Course in Miracles is unique among spiritualities or spiritual approaches, both contemporary and ancient ones.\" I have found remarkable parallels between the Course and the ancient Gnostic writings, in particular that the world was made in error, not by God. While there apparently was never one organized creed of Gnosticism, it does appear that its teachings and gospels were part of early Christian thought, and then stamped out, as the Christian Church that we know today established its formal creed. Kenneth Wapnick's book Love Does Not Condemn deals with the subject of Gnosticism and its relation to the Course. It might be helpful to readers of this forum to provide a brief explanation regarding the relationship, similarities, and differences of the early Gnostic writings to the principles contained in the Course. A: Interestingly, Ken's original intention was to write a brief article on this topic; but he found his \"article\" expanding rather quickly as he read more of the Gnostic and related literature, until finally he decided a full-length book would be needed in order to do justice to this important dimension of Course. Thus, his six-hundred-page book. So to ask for a \"brief explanation\" is",
    "output": "quite a challenge. At the risk of oversimplifying a complex topic-- there were several schools of Gnosticism, with differing views among the schools, and within each school as well--we will give it a try by presenting some general contours. The Course and Gnosticism are similar in maintaining that the world was not created by the true God, but by a false god. In the higher teachings, primarily the Valentinian school, which differed significantly from others, the world was regarded as an illusion. Valentinus called it a fantasy or \"Sophia's folly.\" This resulted in a generally negative attitude toward the world; in fact, Gnostics despised the world and sought to avoid being \"contaminated\" by it. So, while they said the world was not real, they made it real in their minds by seeing it as the locus of sin--which led many Gnostics to avoid involvement with the world and the body. The behavioral and practical implications of the metaphysics varied greatly among the different groups, some of which were shared with early Christians. This is where we see a major difference between Gnosticism and A Course in Miracles. The Course's position is inherent in the title of Ken's book: Love Does Not Condemn, which comes from a passage about the body, but implicitly includes the world: \"The body was not made by love. Yet love does not condemn it and can use it lovingly, respecting what the Son of God has made and using it to save him from illusions\" (T-18.VI.4:7-8). The entire physical universe is seen as illusory--as part of the ego's defensive war against God--but it is not judged inherently evil or sinful, as it now can serve the Holy Spirit's purpose of correcting our purpose in having made it. Thus, the problem is not the world or the body, but our use of it, which is entirely a function of our decision-making minds. This is why the Course says nothing about behavior, much to the frustration of many of its students. It teaches us how to be in the world but not of it; but the focus is exclusively on bringing out of concealment the purpose we have chosen in our minds: namely, to use the world and the body to keep the separation real, while not accepting responsibility for it. Our salvation comes, therefore, not in avoiding involvement with the world, but by seeing it as a classroom in which we learn how to use it to undo our belief in separation through forgiveness. The non-dualism of the Course's metaphysics is thus maintained."

    "text_input": "Q #994: If God doesn't know we exist, who the hell have we all been praying to for thousands of years? Have we been choreographing our own answers? If our prayers were not answered, was it because we couldn't create properly? Is this why millions of people were killed during the Holocaust although they were devout, prayerful people--because there was no one to hear their prayers and help them? Has everyone that thought there was a God who cared about them, guided them, and loved them been duped? Am I interpreting all of this correctly?",
    "output": "No, you are not quite interpreting the message of A Course in Miracles correctly. The Course does give us a way of thinking about God and the nature of this world that is radically different from what western religions have taught for centuries. However, its central message is not that we suffer because God cannot hear us or because we cannot \"create properly,\" but rather that we suffer because we actively choose to experience suffering instead of the Love of God. The Course informs us that we have been wrong about God because we have been so very wrong about ourselves. Let us take a closer look at how it explains these dynamics. Jesus tells us that God does not know we are here because we are not here. In the original instant, filled with imaginary guilt, we wanted to escape from God--simultaneously believing that we had killed Him and that He would rise again and give us the punishment we thought we deserved for daring to consider the idea of separation. So we chose to listen to the ego, fall asleep, and dream up this world. Having been birthed by a thought of guilt, this is a guilt-filled world in which everyone appears to lead lives that overflow with punishing pain. While, as you mentioned, Holocaust victims provide an example of extreme physical and psychological anguish, we need hardly look to them to find proof of human suffering that one would expect a Loving God to alleviate. Indeed, simply living as a body is a set up for almost continual pain-- the pain of material need, illness, aging, loss, dependency, and so on. The Course asks us to look honestly at this and admit that, as much as we may profess to love Him, if we believe that God created and controls the events in this world and our lives, a part of our minds must hate Him for not doing more to improve things. And yet, ultimately, the Course's message is a happy one, which lets us know that God's Love is much closer than most of us ever imagined. We do not need to beseech God, please Him, or struggle to earn His Love because, in reality, we remain safely enveloped in it, at home in Heaven. As the Course says \"Life not in Heaven is impossible, and what is not in Heaven is not anywhere. Outside of Heaven, only the conflict of illusion stands; senseless, impossible and beyond all reason, and yet perceived as an eternal barrier to Heaven\" (T-23.II.19:6-7). So all we need do to begin to awaken to that reality is undo the one mistake that we have made from the moment time seemed to begin--choosing the thought system of the ego rather than the Holy Spirit (Who represents the memory of God's Love in our mind). When we choose the Holy Spirit's Love, we will be happy regardless of whether the circumstances in our lives are ones that the world would judge to be pleasant or miserable. Likewise, when we choose the ego, we will be unhappy no matter how good or bad our external situation appears to be. For this reason, we cannot judge someone else's life as being fair or unfair. While certainly the outer life of virtually every human being seems filled with gross injustices, we cannot know why each of us chooses a particular script or the lessons we may be learning as a result of our choice. Those who have believed that God cared about them, guided them, and loved them have not been duped if this belief helped them to get in touch with His Love in their mind. In the end, it does not really matter how we conceptualize God or our relationship to Him, so long as we find a way of doing so that helps us replace our guilt and fear with love and inner peace. Basically, Jesus just wants to help us find our way home and has given us the Course as a tool to help us make the journey. But this does not make the Course any more or less true than other tools people have used for the same purpose. Remember, nothing in this world is true, and anything in this world can help us move closer to truth (love) in our mind if that is the purpose we give it. This is why, after establishing the illusory nature of the physical world and the body, Jesus can make a statement like, \"If it helps you, think of me holding your hand and leading you. And I assure you this will be no idle fantasy\" (W-pI.70.9:3-4). Similarly, if people throughout history have felt God's Love even while conceptualizing it in a way that is clearly at odds from how it is presented in the Course, this has been no idle fantasy."

    "text_input": "Q #995: You have said that if we really understood the Course's message that we do not exist, we would feel terror. But I don't feel terror, just uncomfortable and sometimes afraid. I have a friend who is doing A Course in Miracles, too, and she says she feels happiness when she thinks of losing her individuality and joining with God. I suspect that there is a degree of blockage in  both of us, and perhaps in all of us. This is our denial, our non-acceptance of the truth. Is this true?",
    "output": "Yes, anyone who believes that he or she is here is in denial of the truth. If we were ready to fully accept the truth, we would no longer have any need for this dream and would awaken to our true home in Heaven, where we are still one with our Creator. The fact that we do not do so tells us that we must have a motivation for choosing this world of separation and pain over the peace of God. A Course in Miracles lets us know what that motivation is. It states that we made up this world of murder and attack because it is a picture of what we think we are. We believe that we are murderers, deserving of death as punishment for what we have done (T-20.III.4). And what we accuse ourselves of doing is usurping the place of God; thus, in essence, killing Him off. At the same time, we believe that God is not really dead and will come back to give us our punishment. So, the ego's only conception of God is as an angry father pursuing His guilty son (M-17.7:10). These terrifying dynamics motivate us to continue listening to the ego, and keep dreaming that we are in this world of individuality and separation, which God can enter not (W-pII.3.2:4). In other words, as bad as this world can be, we think it is our protection. However, another part of our mind--symbolized in the Course as the Holy Spirit--retains the memory of the true God's Love. It knows that the angry, vengeful God is a fiction of the ego. And so, we have two competing thought systems in our mind: the ego's, which is literally scared to death of losing our individuality, and the Holy Spirit's, which knows that we have nothing to fear and that our recognition of this fact and resultant awakening would give us everything we truly want. The Course is aimed at the part of our mind that chooses between these two thought systems. On one hand, it asks us to look at the terror, which we miscreated an entire world to avoid facing. On the other hand, it tells us that this fear is made up and gives us a method for finally letting it go and being at peace at last. Not surprisingly then, we are likely to experience many shifting and conflicting emotions as we work with the Course. In addition, because our terror is deeply buried, we may not have a direct emotional experience of it--and certainly not consistently. The Course tells us that \"What I call 'my' thoughts are not my real thoughts\" (W-pI.51.4:3). It would make the same statement about feelings. Feelings lie because they are virtually always the result of thoughts about some aspect of our illusory existence as individuals within this physical world. Of course, feelings can be helpful if they motivate us to ask the Holy Spirit to look with us at the thoughts behind them and, in the process, let His Love take the place of the ego's guilt. If we can do just that with our feelings-- learning to simply watch them without judging them, over- analyzing them, or worrying about them--they will gradually lessen in intensity and seeming importance as our capacity to feel the peace of God increases."

    "text_input": "Q #996: Given A Course in Miracles' distinction between form and content, it seems to me that Jesus' words [that we will (can) do \"even greater things\" than he did] refer to content and not form (e.g., moving mountains, walking on water, raising the dead). But as I puzzle over his words in the context of content I wonder what \"greater things\" are.",
    "output": "In the Bible Jesus is reported to have made this statement, though scripture scholars have found no historical data to support most of the biblical sayings of Jesus, nor the miracles he is said to have performed. If he did say and do the things that are recorded in the gospels, you are correct in distinguishing form and content. Whether as a historical figure, or the author of the Course, Jesus is a symbol for the part of the mind that chooses God's Love rather than the ego. He does not identify with the body and would therefore never refer to form. In the Course, Jesus does not make any statement about our doing greater things than he. In fact, every reference to our relationship with him and with one another speaks only of the equality of the Sonship (e.g. T-8.IV.6; T-1.II.3; T-5.II.9; T-6.I.5). There is nothing greater than to accept the Atonement for oneself just as he did. The perfect equality of the Sonship reflects the Course's non-dualistic teaching that there is one Son in union with the Father. Equality and sameness, therefore, are very important concepts in the Holy Spirit's curriculum. They are corrections for the ego's use of difference, inequality, and comparison to establish and maintain belief in the separation. Jesus asks that we make the same choice he did: to listen only to the Voice that speaks for God. He tells us: \"I have assured you that the Mind that decided for me is also in you, and that you can let it change you just as it changed me\" (T-5.II.10:1). There is no real difference between him and us. There is only a difference in our experience while we continue to choose separation. When the mind chooses the Holy Spirit, Who represents the memory of God's Love, there are no comparisons, no degrees of greater or lesser. The choice is complete in the instant it is made, and it is the same for everyone. It is the same and only choice Jesus made. As we are told in the workbook: \"Love makes no comparisons\" (W-pI.195.4:2). We are learning to make love the only choice we make by seeing how painful it is to choose the ego. When we are ready, we will make one final choice for God; the greatest, and only true thing we can do."

    "text_input": "Q #997: Toward the beginning of the text, Jesus says that miracles are directed toward those who can \"use them for themselves\" and he also comments that only he is in a position to know \"where they can be bestowed.\" What I don't get is: Aren't they needed everywhere? Couldn't everyone walking this earth in pain use miracles for themselves? Jesus seems to hint that only some people need miracles. Can you explain? A: When reading A Course in Miracles, it is very helpful to remember that Jesus frequently speaks to us in a poetic, symbolic way. Taken out of context, his words can, at times, seem to contradict the overall message of the Course. However, the more we study the Course, the clearer it becomes that he is not contradicting himself but rather restating the same themes over and over again with slight variations, hoping that, at some point, what he is trying to tell us will sink in. With that in mind, let us take a look at the two statements you asked about.",
    "output": "Both of these statements come in Chapter 1 when Jesus is explaining what he means by the term miracle. Most of us have always thought of miracles as an extraordinary event in the external, physical world. Jesus lets us know that in the context of the Course, a miracle is solely a shift in perception from the ego's thought system of sin, guilt, and fear, to the Holy Spirit's thought system of forgiveness. In other words, a miracle is an entirely internal event happening only in the mind and having nothing to do with the world. Miracles may seem to have results in this world, but this is a reflection of the miracle, or changed thinking, not the miracle itself. You are right that anyone who believes that he or she is here could use a miracle. That, in fact, is exactly what Jesus is trying to tell us. When he says, \"Miracles are selective only in the sense that they are directed towards those who can use them for themselves\" (T-1.III.9:1), he is not implying that miracles are available only to some people. Indeed, he implies exactly the opposite by beginning the sentence with \"miracles are selective only in the sense ... \" He is letting us know that there is just one sense in which miracles are not universal, and that is in the form the miracle or correction takes within our thinking. While the content of a miracle is always a shift from thoughts that project guilt to thoughts that extend love, the specific correction thought will always show up in our mind in a way ideally suited to remedy the specific thought that made correction necessary. For example, I may need to forgive an abusive parent while you may need to forgive a partner by whom you felt betrayed. Both of us, in the midst of our pain, could turn to Jesus or the Holy Spirit in our mind and ask to see things differently. Both of us would then find ourselves accessing forgiveness thoughts that applied to our specific struggle. If we wanted to get technical, we could say that even within our own thinking, the form the correction seems to take is really the reflection of the miracle or shift, not the miracle itself. But this is more technically precise than Jesus needed to be at this point in the text. Jesus also states: \"That the miracle may have effects on your brothers that you may not recognize is not your concern ... the action aspect of the miracle should be controlled by me because of my complete awareness of the whole plan. The impersonal nature of miracle-mindedness ensures your grace, but only I am in a position to know where they can be bestowed\" (T-1.III.8:1,4-5). He is not implying that there are people who do not need miracles. He is simply telling us that although the miracle is a shift in our mind, we should not try to control miracles, decide when they are needed, or determine how they will express themselves. We should ask him, as our wiser internal teacher, to make such decisions. Again, A Course in Miracles becomes much easier to understand if we approach it like poetry or a symphony rather than a precise, scientific report. When we focus too heavily on the words, the Course can seem (to borrow Jesus' imagery) like nothing more than scattered threads of melody. But when we join with him--moving beyond its words to connect with the love that inspired them--we will see how those scattered threads of melody form one inclusive chorus (T- 31.VIII.11:5)."

    "text_input": "Q #998: I have recently done something for which I am deeply ashamed, not because it hurt anyone else--it didn't --but because I thought I was a better, more spiritual, more evolved person who would not stoop to this level. I am upset and disappointed to find out that this isn't so. I also feel tons of guilt. I don't seem to be able to forgive myself for taking this action. How does one work with \"sinful\" or \"wrong\" actions, as a student of the Course?",
    "output": "As students of A Course in Miracles, when we recognize that we have done or said something that did not come from love, we should remember the following statements: \"The world was made as an attack on God. It symbolizes fear ... frightened people can be vicious\" (W-pII.3.2:1- 2; T-3.I.4:2). In other words, this world symbolizes the fear of God's Love, and any person who believes that he or she is here must be afraid of love and, therefore, vicious. Because of these dynamics, we could safely say that, with rare exceptions, spiritual or evolved people do not come here. If we were highly spiritual and evolved, we would have no need of this dream and would remain awake in Heaven. When we feel ashamed about something we have done and upset that we are not more spiritual, we can be sure that we are analyzing the situation with the same inner teacher that led us to take the misguided action in the first place: the ego. The ego wants only to maintain our certainty that we are individuals who exist in a very real world. It does not care if we think we are spiritual or sinful, as long as we think there is a separate, autonomous \"I\" to analyze. The only way out of this hopeless and circular thought system is to change internal teachers-- dropping the ego's hand and asking the Holy Spirit to help us look at our troubling actions through His loving and non-judgmental eyes. He will always help us to see that we are neither sinful nor spiritual; we are simply fearful and thus make mistakes that are really calls for the love we think we do not have inside of us. Through this process, we gradually come to the realization that we are not who we think we are. There is no \"me\" to label as spiritual or guilty. Rather, there is an illusion of an individual who always reflects the mind's choice between the guilt of the ego, or the Love and forgiveness of the Holy Spirit. To hold on to guilt about what we think we did wrong, whether it was five minutes ago or fifty years ago, is really the ego's cruel way of cementing our guilt in place forever. This is so because, obviously, we will never be able to change the past. Thus, we are predicating our ability to be at peace upon something that is impossible. Fortunately, the Course teaches us that we can undo the cause of the error now by letting go of the guilt now--again, simply by changing internal teachers. Once we have learned to do this every time we begin to feel ashamed of ourselves, our reaction to our own mistakes will start to be something like, \"So, I got afraid again--what else is new?\" At that point, we will begin to understand Jesus' healed perspective of our lives and how he can tell us that, \"All [our] past except its beauty is gone, and nothing is left but a blessing\" (T- 5.IV.8:2)."

    "text_input": "Q #999: Why does A Course in Miracles raise so many conflicts? I have never come across any spiritual or psychological practice that focuses so much on our resistance. I understand why the Course does this, but I find it personally unbearable. I guess as even Helen Schucman (the Course's scribe) was unable to fulfill the Course's high goals, I can also let it slip by. But is there not another way? I find the Course is a detour into battle. Surely this was not Jesus' intention! A: You are correct that Jesus did not intend the Course to be a detour into battle. However, he did mean for it to be a tool that leads us into looking directly at the battle that is already raging within our mind--the battle between our longing to return to God's Love and our desire to maintain our identity as an individual, autonomous being. For this reason, the Course can seem to cause us to experience more conflict. In reality, it is simply causing us to recognize our own internal war to keep the memory of God's Love from our awareness.",
    "output": "The fact that we believe we are actually in this dream world shows that we have chosen to align ourselves with the ego and its insistence that we are safer and happier here than we would be in our true home in Heaven. Therefore, it is not surprising that students typically struggle with the Course's message that nothing in this world will ever make us happy. To the ego, nothing is more unbearable than facing the fact that all the roads of this world \"but lead to disappointment, nothingness and death\" (T-31.IV.2:3). However, Jesus is not appealing to us as egos--he is really speaking to the decision making part of our mind that chooses between internal teachers. He is laying out a process for shifting from the ego to the Holy Spirit as our internal guide. Every time we do that, we automatically go from projecting anger, guilt, and attack, to instead extending love and forgiveness. The goal of the Course, however, is actually not that high or lofty. It is not meant to get us to permanently make that internal shift and become radiant beams of light. Rather, it is meant to help us see that this shift is possible-- that the Holy Spirit does exist in our mind--and to motivate us to watch how our own choice against making this shift, rather than anything in the external world, keeps us miserable. This is why the Course states that it is \"a beginning, not an end\" (W-ep.1:1). When we approach the Course this way, we will experience it differently--as a source of inspiration rather than guilt. This also means that we cannot know or judge how another person has been affected by the Course. You brought up the example of Helen Schucman. Certainly the book Absence from Felicity: The Story of Helen Schucman and Her Scribing of A Course in Miracles, makes it clear that she seemed to experience resistance to Jesus' love. It also makes it clear that she was aware of this resistance and, more often than not, continued to follow his guidance. In that sense, we, as Course students, could view her life as quite inspiring. One final note: If you find working with the Course to be continually and consistently unbearable, it is possible that it is not the right path for you. Remember that the Course says, \"There are many thousands of other forms [i.e. spiritual paths], all with the same outcome\" (M- 1.4:2). Ultimately, it is not the form of the path you take that matters; only that you find one that helps you awaken to God's Love for you and yours for Him (T-4.III.6:3)."

    "text_input": "Q #1000: From \"There is no world!\" (W-pI.132.6:2), to \"What the world is, is but a fact\" (M- 11.1:9). Certainly in the illusion the world seems to us a fact and we experience it as a fact. I was surprised to find this reference to the world as a fact in the manual. Is this a reference merely to the natural world (grass, mountains, trees, etc.)? After all the references in A Course in Miracles to the world as an illusion, is this but one more example of another contradiction in words in the Course? Or is it an emphasis on informing us we must deal with the world we made as a fact? I am thinking here of: \"There are decisions to make here, and they must be made whether they be illusions or not\" (S-1.I:2:4). I found myself rather unsettled and somewhat confused after reading the statement in the manual. A: Yes, Jesus is making different points about the world in different places in the Course. This is why we stress the need to distinguish between the two levels on which the Course is written. Level One contrasts truth and illusion, wherein only God and Heaven are real (including His Son, Christ, and the creations of Christ). All else is illusory and not real: \"There is no world!\" But since we are too fearful of accepting that and living accordingly, Jesus talks to us about the",
    "output": "world as though it were real--because we think it is. This is not really contradictory, as the sentences preceding and following the one you cite about decisions explain: \"You have been told to ask the Holy Spirit for the answer to any specific problem, and that you will receive a specific answer if such is your need. You have also been told that there is only one problem and one answer. In prayer this is not contradictory ... You cannot be asked to accept answers which are beyond the level of need that you can recognize\" (S-1.I.2:1-5). Jesus is letting us know that this is a process--like climbing a ladder. He thus gently and gradually helps us change our minds about the reality of the world by having us see that our perceptions are really interpretations emanating from the prior choice we make in our minds to take either the ego's hand or his as we go through our day. This is the other level on which the Course is written--Level Two, which contrasts the wrong-minded (the ego's) and right-minded (the Holy Spirit's) ways of looking at the world. The process involves bringing our wrong-minded perceptions to the truth of Heaven reflected in our right minds. And when at last our perceptions are all right-minded--meaning we listen only to the Voice of the Holy Spirit-- our minds will no longer be split, and then love will just flow through us directing us in all we think and do. In that state of mind--what the Course calls the real world--we know the world is illusory and we will see all people as either calling out for love or expressing it. Jesus is gently leading us in that direction in all of his teachings and lessons."

    "text_input": "Q #1001: I am a high school drop-out. I have made an ego that never was able to make an adult life for herself. I feel so isolated and helpless to change the loneliness that I want to die. In my 55 years I have failed at everything that I have tried to do. Mental illness and emotional disturbance are what my life has been and I see no hope out of this living hell. But this is just the ego I made up. Jesus says I could see peace instead of this [Lesson 34] because I am not this wretched ego! I know that intellectually, but it doesn't make any difference--it doesn't stop the pain. Can you please point me in the right direction as I try to accept God's help and experience peace?",
    "output": "It may be of some comfort for you to know that you are not alone. The pain you describe is the inevitable experience of everyone when the mind chooses to believe that separation from God is possible and has been accomplished. The anguish is often denied, covered over, and camouflaged, but it is universal for all the separated ones. The pain of separation cannot be dismissed with an intellectual understanding of its origin as taught by the metaphysics of A Course in Miracles. In fact, using the principles of the Course to try to squelch the pangs of pain only exacerbates the problem. The Course's teachings are meant to be applied gently, beginning with the kind acceptance of oneself, no matter what the ego's baggage may look like in one's life. The Course's message of forgiveness is that the thought of separation is not a sin, whatever form it takes, nor is anyone a sinner who comes here seeking what cannot be found here. Jesus acknowledges the feelings the separation engenders when he tells us in the workbook: \"You think you are the home of evil, darkness and sin. You think if anyone could see the truth about you he would be repelled, recoiling from you as if from a poisonous snake. You think if what is true about you were revealed to you, you would be struck with horror so intense that you would rush to death by your own hand, living on after seeing this being impossible\" (W- pI.93.1:1-3). Notice he does not say some of you may think this. These words apply equally to those who view themselves as failures and to those who consider themselves great successes in the world's terms. Everyone holds this secret (or not so secret) thought about themselves. The key words in this statement are: \"You think you are ... \" Jesus is not saying that we are these things, but he acknowledges, without judgment, that we perceive ourselves in this way. This is a very important distinction and a very important passage. In it we find recognition of the condition in which we seem to find ourselves, acceptance of it as our experience, and most importantly, no judgment in its regard. This is one of the many ways Jesus provides us with a model for our learning. He does what he asks us to do: look honestly at how we truly feel, accept that these are our feelings, and not judge them as sinful. The real anguish does not come from being a failure in the world, but in the judgment that this failure is proof that you are a miserable sinner who deserves to die. It is always the interpretation of a situation that gives it meaning. These interpretations are what Jesus asks us to question so we may determine whether we have chosen to think with the ego, which fills our lives with conflict, or with the Holy Spirit, Who fills us with peace. Finding peace then requires willingness to exchange the ego's perception for the Holy Spirit's, which implies willingness to let go of the ego's interpretation. The Holy Spirit sets a standard for success and failure in direct opposition to what the ego teaches. The world bombards us with the message that we can, and must find happiness in this world, and our success is measured by this happiness. Our judgments against ourselves are founded on this belief. The Course teaches that this belief system is backwards and is based on the belief that the separation has not only occurred, but has been a smashing success. The ego views mental and emotional distress as failure; the Holy Spirit sees it and every aspect of our lives as a classroom in which to reinterpret everything according to His message. He is teaching us that the sickness we all suffer from is in the mind that believes it is a body which suffers emotionally and psychologically because it identifies with the thought of separation. The problem is not that we think monstrous things about ourselves, it is that we believe they are true, take them seriously, and more significantly, judge them to be sinful. The ego tells us that someone with mental illness is more in hell than someone who is emotionally balanced. Hell is hell. While the world offers many different Band-Aids with the illusion of relieving the pain of separation, none of them contributes to true healing. A successful life does not bring healing, and emotional distress does not prevent it. The only way to set yourself in the direction of peace is to be willing to accept that what you believe about yourself is not true, and to put your faith in the practice of forgiveness as the Course teaches. In the text, Jesus gently calls us to faith: \"Have faith in only this one thing, and it will be sufficient: God wills you be in Heaven, and nothing can keep you from it, or it from you. Your wildest misperceptions, your weird imaginings, your blackest nightmares all mean nothing. They will not prevail against the peace God wills for you\" (T-13.XI.7:1-3). If the pain and misery of your life have led you to the teachings of the Course, they have served a useful purpose. There remains only the choice to accept the hope it offers by taking the first small step of acknowledging that the mind that chose devastation can make a different choice. Since the ego has failed you, you now have the opportunity to succeed by pursuing the Holy Spirit's curriculum with an open mind. This requires only that you consider that maybe you have been wrong about who you are, maybe you are not a hopeless failure, and maybe the Holy Spirit is right. You have already set yourself in the right direction in seeking Jesus' message in the Course and are therefore \"no longer wholly insane, nor no longer alone\" (T-17.VII.10:2). This in itself is no small comfort."

    "text_input": "Q #1002: I am new to the Course and am confused about how to forgive, how to continue to work as a massage therapist since the body is an illusion, how to practice another belief system while learning the Course. I was intensely abused by someone who believed that their system was the only way and I was to go against my nature and be part of them. I am afraid that I may be misled again. Are there things here that can help us in our learning, even though we do not know where we are going? A: Since A Course in Miracles is a thought system that completely reverses the ego's thinking, it is important to be gentle and patient in applying its teachings to our lives. This reversal means allowing the Holy Spirit to transform every judgment we have about everything. Obviously this is a process that takes time, not because time is real, but because we believe it is real, along with everything else in the illusory world. The first change from the ego's perception to the Holy Spirit's is to see one's life as a classroom for learning the lessons of forgiveness. This lays the foundation for all subsequent steps in reversing our thinking. Each step requires that we not skip steps. Remembering how invested we are in identifying with the body helps to set the gentle pace of looking at everything differently. While learning to apply the principles of the Course to our lives, we continue to live and work as usual. It is not helpful to deny our experience as bodies, nor to try to believe that our perceived needs, experiences, and relationships are illusory, since we still believe they are real. The Holy Spirit needs them as teaching tools in His classroom for learning forgiveness. We are not being coerced or pressured in any way to do anything we are unwilling to do. \" ... God's Will cannot be forced upon you, being an experience of total willingness\" (T-8.III.2:3). In fact, there is a safeguard against coercion in the Course, for it tells us we will not learn anything we do not want to learn. Our practice and learning is therefore commensurate with our willingness. Willingness is the only requirement for our practice of the Course. Neither perfection nor complete understanding is required. It begins with willingness to look at every grievance as the projection of the mind's guilt for having chosen to believe the separation is real. Thus every relationship, indeed everything in our lives, is useful in the practice of forgiveness. Anything that is not perfect peace, from a slight annoyance to raging anger (see W-pI.21.2), reflects back to us the mind's decision to listen to the ego's tale of separation, rather than the Holy Spirit's truth of our oneness as God's Son. Forgiveness means recognizing that this decision is the true source of all pain and conflict in our lives and in the world. Thus, the problem is in the mind, not in other people or the world, or even one's own body. The solution, therefore, is found in the mind as well. The goal of the Course is to train us to look at everything in our lives from this perspective (see W-in.), and to gradually learn that nothing external to the mind has any effect on it.",
    "output": "The Course is not the only spiritual path that leads us back home. As we are told in the manual, it is one among many forms (see M-1.3,4). Every mind will eventually choose to accept the truth of our oneness with each other and with God. That is the content at the heart of the Course's teaching. As you familiarize yourself with its fundamental principles, you will find that they are distinct from the teachings of other spiritual paths. In many cases they are in striking contrast to most theological and spiritual disciplines. Trying to follow another belief system while learning the Course will eventually introduce conflict in your practice and impede progress. And since the ego already presents us with a vast array of distractions and obstacles, another conflict is an unnecessary burden. If you resonate to the Course's teaching and choose to take it as your spiritual path, you will find that it requires only that you proceed gently and patiently, one step at a time, at a pace set only by your own desire and willingness. This may mean combining the Course with other paths for a time. The Holy Spirit will never take them away from you. If we are willing to question our interpretation of things, and ask for help, the Holy Spirit will use everything as a learning tool, and \"will respond fully to [the] slightest invitation\" (T-5.VII.6:6)."

The authors usually claim to have seen and experienced these entities and to have evidence that proves they exist. I've seen so many of these books that I'm starting to believe them. But even if these things do exist, according to the Course, wouldn't they still be illusory just like the rest of the world of form, having all been created by the ego? Wouldn't it say that the real God has nothing to do with any of them, despite whatever seeming power they may have, and that their belief in their own power represents a failure to realize they are just ego fragments? A: Yes, everything you have said is correct. A Course in Miracles tells us that form is not reality, it is an illusion, and \"if you see it you must be mistaken\" (T-22.III.7:5). From a Course perspective, it does not matter whether we see the entities you mentioned with our physical eyes or only in our thoughts. Either way, if we perceive them as individual beings, separate from ourselves and from God, they are illusory. As a Course student, it could be very helpful to realize that whether they exist only in stories someone made up or in this physical world we all made up, vampires and werewolves are no more or less real than any of the other people who seem to inhabit our lives or even than our own individual identity. As you stated; people, animals, or combinations thereof who believe in their own power fail to recognize that they are split off fragments of God--the only true source of power. But remember: It is only you who needs to recognize this. Generally, vampires and werewolves find the Course a bit too threatening.",

Jesus says I could see peace instead of this (W-pI.34). What would he have me hear? What would he have me to do? What am I doing wrong? A: Jesus is teaching us all that we can be peaceful regardless of our limitations. Thus he says in the manual, \"Do not despair, then, because of limitations. It is your function to escape from them, but not to be without them\" (M-26.4:1-2). Escaping from our limitations means not giving",
    "output": "them power to take away the inner peace that is always present in our split minds. If we follow the ego part of our minds, we will see our limitations as a prison and then compare ourselves with others, winding up in the painful jaws of judgment. If we choose against the ego, however, we will see our limitations as a classroom, and as we take Jesus' hand instead of the ego's, we will develop compassion toward ourselves and others, and learn how to smile gently at the ego and not take it as seriously as we once did. The key is to be able to distinguish between form and content. Anything of the body-- including emotional conditions--is the form. The content is the decision you make in your mind as to how you will interpret the form. Choosing the ego results in feelings of victimization, guilt, judgment, anger, despair, and hatred of the body. Choosing Jesus or the Holy Spirit results in patience, compassion, and kindness towards yourself and others, and acceptance of the world and body as the curriculum Jesus or the Holy Spirit can use to help your mind be healed of its thoughts of sin, guilt, and fear. These themes are developed in our book, The Healing Power of Kindness.Volume Two: Forgiving Our Limitations. You did not say anything about having sought help from a therapist; that would not conflict with your work with the Course and might in fact help free you from the ego's uses of your limitations."

    "text_input": "Q #1005: I studied A Course in Miracles in the 1980s, but only within the past year did I start applying the workbook lessons. For the past several years, however, I have had awarenesses of God's presence. I know that love is the only truth in this illusion. Recently, I realized that I've forgiven all the people that I thought had wronged me, simply because I know that these wrongs never happened in the first place. When I read the daily lesson, I feel a sense of peace that stays with me throughout the day. This evening as I was bathing there were a few seconds in which I lost all association with my body. I felt as if I were mentally gazing down upon an alien and was left with a completely neutral sense of the body--neither disgust nor enchantment. Is the illusory world beginning to disappear for me? Am I beginning to wake up from the dream? A: It could be that you are beginning to wake up, but since we do not know you, we really cannot give you a definitive answer. People experience the process of disidentifying with the body and the world in different ways. Jesus talks about this experience in a series of beautiful paragraphs in \"Beyond the Body\" in the text (T-18.VI). He speaks of it in the context of the Identity we share that transcends all specialness and the limitations of the body. Thus he says of the experience:",
    "output": "\"What really happens is that you have given up the illusion of a limited awareness, and lost your fear of union ... There is no violence at all in this escape. The body is not attacked, but simply properly perceived. It does not limit you, merely because you would not have it so. You are not really 'lifted out' of it; it cannot contain you. You go where you would be, gaining, not losing, a sense of Self\" (T-18.VI.11:7; 13:1-5). In the workbook, Jesus tells us that \"to be without a body is to be in our natural state\" (W- pI.72:9:3). So it is not something special; it is merely natural. As the process of awakening proceeds through our practice of forgiveness, we thus will take the body and everything of the body less and less seriously, until we reach the point where we know we are not our bodies, even though we still appear as a body. This has nothing to do with death, as some students mistakenly think. It is a shift from false perception to true perception in our minds, and there may or may not be a physical correlation--most of the time, there is not. What is of prime importance is the shift we make in our minds about the purpose for which we will now use our bodies: to learn that we all share the same ego thought system, the Holy Spirit's correction of that, and the power to choose between them. We all share the pain of separation, and we are all calling out for the love we believe we have denied."

    "text_input": "Q #1006: I have read your answer to #15, yet somehow I need a little more help. I have a healthy son I am thrilled with, whom I had through in vitro fertilization. I desired more children, but since have lost two to miscarriages. I believe I have a great deal of guilt in that my age--past 40--would be a gamble and here seemed the proof: death of both embryos due to chromosome damage. I really feel like I murdered them both by seeking magic --the in vitro fertilization. So here is my issue: Almost daily, when I am with my son, someone asks if he is my \"only child.\" My mind instantly swings into guilt mode. I know the question is just a conversation opener, but it feels like an attack. I have issues around the miscarriages, older stepchildren, and adopting, and all my feelings bubble up. The last time I could only nod my head in shame and guilt. With my five-year-old son there and unaware of all the details, I could not attack back as my ego wants, \"No, he is not my only, the other two are dead!\" And I realize an attack would alienate everyone. But my internal buttons and feelings of sin, guilt, and fear are being pushed. I am still stumped as to how to cope with all this. I do acknowledge what is happening in the moment and how enraged I become. I do see how their bringing up this deep pain (which is just scratching the surface of the original pain of killing off God) makes me want to \"kill,\" through words or fantasy, the person I perceive as my attacker, even though they only have unintentionally handed me the mirror so I can look at my guilt. I also know intellectually that I did not murder my unborn children, but part of me must not believe it. I ask for help from Jesus and show him my negative thoughts, but I would like more healing than this. I find it difficult to accept the statement, \"Loss is not loss when properly perceived.\" I understand intellectually that this is all an illusion, that I am not a body. But when this stuff comes up they are just concepts to my ego. A: Where you are with all your feelings is okay. You don't want to try to use the intellectual concepts of A Course in Miracles to change what seems to be happening for you. You will know at a deeper level that they are true at some point on your spiritual path, but for now you simply want to be as honest as you can about your thoughts and feelings about your life circumstances-- they after all comprise your classroom. Mostly you speak of your guilt, but what also comes through very clearly is your anger. And although you acknowledge your rage at the strangers' inquiries, there almost certainly are layers to that anger that you may be missing by jumping to the ontological explanation that you killed God. And all these unrecognized and unacknowledged layers of defenses continue to operate below your awareness, keeping your focus outside yourself, which of course is their purpose, despite your best intentions to look at the guilt within. What might these other layers involve? Your anger at the strangers seems somehow out of proportion to the nature of their \"attack,\" as you acknowledge. It may feel safer to keep the focus of your anger on them than on other perhaps less conscious targets. For it seems likely from what you say that you are angry that you have not been able to have the children you want--perhaps angry at a spouse or ex-spouse, a lover, a parent, or God--someone else who is somehow",
    "output": "responsible for depriving you of what you so desperately want, requiring you to rely on your own creative attempts to have the children on your own that will make your life feel more complete. And there must also be great sadness and grief at the recurring losses. It's important that you uncover the anger and grief you are carrying, and all the hidden justifications for those feelings, not because they are true, but because you still believe at some level that they are true. And you cannot jump to the ontological explanation without looking at the ego's layers of defenses as clearly as you can, or you will simply keep the defenses unexamined and intact (T- 11.V.1,2:1-2). Once you can get in touch with the anger and the specific thoughts behind that anger, you can begin to take responsibility for the projection involved in those judgments against others. Now it is true that all the levels of anger are simply defenses against the underlying ontological guilt, but the thought that we believe we have killed God is mostly an intellectual concept for most of us, which is, as Jesus tells us, \"an instant so ancient that it is beyond all memory, and past even the possibility of remembering\" (M-2.4:1). But we relive its content every instant that we choose the ego, putting our own needs and desires above everyone else's. So we can at least begin to be honest about how much we want to have things our own way and how angry we can become at anyone else who seems to stand in the way of our getting what we want. There's the projection that most of us can begin to identify with. Others may be putting their own needs first, but that could not anger us unless we were doing the same thing but did not want to acknowledge it in ourselves. Ultimately, Jesus assures us, we will learn that \"it is not necessary to follow fear [and guilt] through all the circuitous routes by which it burrows underground and hides in darkness, to emerge in forms quite different from what it is. Yet it is necessary to examine each one as long as you would retain the principle that governs all of them\" (T-15.X.5:1-3). And that principle that we all still retain, even cling to, is that the separation and the accompanying guilt--and the resulting individual self that each of us identifies with--are real and require a defense. But until we can genuinely experience the guilt at that level, we will need to begin with all the specific expressions of our guilt, usually accessed by first acknowledging our anger at others and the judgments we are holding against them. Over time, we will begin to recognize the common thread running through all of our projections, and the ontological guilt will become more of an experience than an empty intellectual concept. But in each case, by looking with Jesus at our projections and accepting the underlying guilt as ours, we will begin to release the need for that defense. And the need for anything or anyone--adult or child--to fill the emptiness we feel inside will lose its power over us. And peace and joy will then fill the space left empty by the disappearing guilt and anger."

He frequently insists that we are one with him, can do what he did, etc. Yet, apparently, one of \"us,\" not Jesus, must be the \"one\" who wholly forgives at least one brother. Am I looking at this correctly? A: No, you are not quite looking at this correctly. The title of Lesson 108 is, \"To give and to receive are one in truth.\" This is a statement that makes no sense from the ego's perspective, which is that we are separate beings (i.e., bodies) with separate interests. The ego tells us that our",
    "output": "very survival depends on taking what we need at someone else's expense. For example, if I am hungry and there is not enough food, I need to find a way to feed myself. If you are there and are hungry too, I have to make sure that it is my body and not yours that receives whatever limited nourishment is available. In other words, I have it only if I keep it. If I give it to you, I lose it. As long as we believe that we are bodies and that this world is real, that dynamic appears to be true. But Jesus knows we are not bodies. We are not even separate minds. We are the one mind of God's One Son, dreaming we could be separate from our Source and from each other. So, in reality (because we are mind and not a body), we cannot really give anything away. What we give, we keep. The reflection of this within this dream world is that when we think hateful, angry, or fearful thoughts about another, we are filled with hate, anger, or fear. When we think loving thoughts about another, we feel love. This is the perspective Jesus is coming from when he states, \"One thought, completely unified, will serve to unify all thought. This is the same as saying one correction will suffice for all correction, or that to forgive one brother wholly is enough to bring salvation to all minds\" (W- pI.108.5:1-2). What he means is that one thought of total forgiveness will forgive everyone in our mind. This is so because true forgiveness means forgiving a brother for what he has not done to us--recognizing that we merely imagined that another's actions could take away our peace. And if we truly recognize this fact in relation to one person, we have to realize that it must be true for everyone--no one can hurt us because no one has the power to deprive us of the peace of God. Thus, within our mind, we will have brought salvation to all minds. This is, in fact, all we need to worry about because, in truth, there is no one--and, indeed, no world--outside our mind. The Course is not saying that one of \"us\" needs to forgive a brother in order to change the world. It is telling you that by completely forgiving one brother, you can entirely change your experience of the world. And in this way, you can remember that salvation is already there for you, in your mind, should you choose it. When, like Jesus, we have learned to let the Holy Spirit (the memory of God's Love) become our only internal Voice, we will become a consistent reflection of love and forgiveness within this dream. This could serve as a reminder to others that none of their imagined sins have had any effect on reality and that salvation is already theirs if they choose to experience it. But when, if, and how they make that choice need not concern us."

For instance, what should I do when people are dishonest or when we make plans to get together and then they don't show up and don't call to cancel? I don't want to be a doormat.",
    "output": "First, we need to be clear that A Course in Miracles does not tell us what to do behaviorally. The guiding principle of the Course is: \"seek not to change the world, but choose to change your mind about the world\" (T-21.in.1:7). However, Jesus is not telling us to become doormats. He simply recognizes that our behavior reflects our thinking; therefore, that is what we need to focus on. In fact, by changing our thinking we can entirely change our experience of this world. This does not necessarily mean that our experiences in this world will change --they may or may not--but rather that we can learn to be at peace no matter what is happening externally. The Course teaches us how to make this internal shift, which will result in our knowing how to handle every challenging situation we encounter. But before we can make it, we need to understand Jesus' healed perspective of our experience of conflict, summarized in the following statements: \"You cannot be unfairly treated ... The secret of salvation is but this: that you are doing this unto yourself. No matter what the form of the attack, this still is true ... you would not react at all to figures in a dream you knew that you were dreaming. Let them be as hateful and as vicious as they may, they could have no effect on you unless you failed to recognize it is your dream\" (T- 26.X.3:2; T-27.VIII.10:1-2,4-6). In other words, Jesus knows our lives here are merely dreams and that in reality we remain at home in Heaven, at one with our Creator. As real and as difficult as life in this world seems to be, it has no effect on God's Love for us. So the key to being at peace within this dream is to realize that the Love of God is still available to us anytime we choose it. The Course conceptualizes the process of making this choice as dropping the ego's hand and instead choosing the Holy Spirit (the memory of God's Love) as our internal Teacher. Every time we feel unfairly treated by another, we choose a teacher and learn a lesson. If we choose the ego (as most of us are accustomed to doing), the lesson will be that we are victims, that our happiness is dependent on the other person's action, and that unless he or she changes, happiness is impossible. And, of course, this guarantees that happiness is impossible because even if this particular person did change, it would not be long before someone else did something we perceived as unfair or unkind. Thus, the ego teaches us its ultimate lesson: My experiences, my pain, my very existence are someone else's fault. On the other hand, when we choose the Holy Spirit as our Teacher, He will teach us that we need not be in pain about what seems to be happening to us. He will tell us that the other person's actions have nothing to do with us. They are simply a reflection of the guilt and fear in that person's mind--the same guilt and fear that is in our mind. That person could not act in an unloving way unless he believed he was unlovable. And we could not be upset about it unless we unconsciously believed that we were getting the treatment we secretly think we deserve--again, stemming from the thought that, having destroyed God's Love, we are unlovable. Holding the Holy Spirit's hand, we reconnect with God's Love in us. And filled with that Love, we cannot help but react lovingly to anything a brother does. So, whenever we are upset, the one thing we need to do is ask the Holy Spirit to help us look at the situation through His loving and non-judgmental eyes. This does not mean we will not express to others our desire that they be honest with us; that they show up when they say they are going to, and so forth. But it does mean that we will express it without any sense of wanting to attack them. Knowing that we have not been hurt, we will automatically know what would be the most loving thing to say or do. And coming from this place of love, we truly model for others how we want to be treated."

The Course teaches us that up to this point, the vast majority of our thoughts have been driven by our unconscious guilt. It describes this kind of thinking as listening to the ego--an internal teacher that insists we destroyed God so we could exist as individuals and that now we are separate both from our Source and from each other.

    "text_input": "Q #1010: Within the world of form, in our daily interactions with people, how is it recommended we conduct ourselves without judgment? We meet people and carry on conversation of one type or another, but, invariably, someone else's name will come up and a \"judgment\" seems to be made; or in conversing about the current events-- political, spiritual, or otherwise--judgments are made. I have felt it very difficult to maintain a \"right mind\" while living in this world, and have wondered what I will talk about--if not about expressing an opinion about one thing or another, be it positive or negative.",
    "output": "It is normal within the world that emanates from the thought of separation to have a point of view and to express it; in fact, it would be impossible not to have preferences and to spend time with some people and not others. Right-mindedness does not mean you cannot have a point of view; you would just not take it seriously; and when you are called upon to make an objective judgment or evaluation, you would do so without the element of condemnation that reinforces differences and separation. A helpful guideline to follow--in terms of the content in your mind--is that if what you say about someone is not true of everyone, it must be coming from your ego, and therefore is an attack. People's forms differ of course--including opinions--but the forms have nothing to do with what is real about us. Content alone is meaningful, and that content is that everyone, without exception, has a wrong mind, a right mind, and the power to choose between the two. That is the vision that should inform the content in your mind. Once you are clear about that, and you have no investment in one side or the other in a discussion, you automatically will do or say whatever is most loving. That could mean participating in the discussion, not participating, or leaving the gathering. Course students many times reinforce separation and differences by not participating in conversations that involve judgments about others--gossip and the like. They assume it could never be the right thing to do, without their first having asked for help and remembering that the content of joining with others, not the form of joining is all that matters. They wind up judging people for judging others, thus making the very mistake they accuse others of making. In terms of content, it may be a loving thing to do what others are doing so that you do not make yourself separate. There is no right or wrong behavior in these situations--only on the level of thought. Jesus tells us to do the \"outrageous\" thing a brother asks of us (T-12.III.4:1), but he cautions us not to do it if it is going to harm oneself or someone else (T-16.I.6:4-5). Discernment is therefore needed. What will also help is to keep in mind that the emphasis in Jesus' teachings about judgment is that it is not sinful; it is just impossible--meaning we do not have the knowledge needed to make judgments. We got ourselves into trouble at the beginning by judging against what was in our best interests--we chose to listen to the ego instead of the Holy Spirit; so we should not put much stock in our ability to make good judgments. That is Jesus' point, and so he encourages us to proceed from a base of humility. These ideas are discussed in \"How Is Judgment Relinquished?\" in the manual for teachers (M-10), and in Lesson 151 in the workbook (W- pI.151). An attitude of humility helps keep our minds open to have the Voice for God judge through us. This common problem in students' processing of the Course's teachings is addressed in our audio albums, \"To Judge or Not to Judge\" and \"The Meaning of Judgment.\" #692 also is relevant."

    "text_input": "Q #1011: With numerous possible scripts to choose from, is it always the ego that makes the choice between one lifetime or dream and another? Although time is neither linear nor real, isn't there still some cause/effect relationship between \"lifetimes\"? Is the idea that the Holy Spirit determines when time will end for \"each\" just an example of poetic effect and metaphor? There were a few revelations a number of years back. Shouldn't there be a lessening of guilt? (There's not.) As a result of those experiences I know that I didn't destroy God--God is all there is. I didn't plan for those experiences the way one plans to go to a movie, but the consequence is that I can't honestly entertain that there is a Jesus figure or symbol helping me. A: It is not clear from what you say how your experience that you did not destroy God left you feeling that there is no Jesus figure or symbol helping you. Yes, God is all there is; but if you were fully aware of that--what the Course calls revelation--you would not also think you are a separate self in need of help. Jesus talks about the experience of union with God in the section in the manual called \"Can God Be Reached Directly?\" (M-26). There he says, \"If God were reached directly in sustained awareness, the body would not be long maintained\" (M-26.3:8); but he also explains that love may ask this healed mind to still appear as a body to others who are still caught in the dream, but asking for some sign of help. That mind, though, would be at peace always, and know that it is not in the dream at all. It would seem, however, that if you experience guilt and feel you are in need of help, there must still be a part of your mind caught in the illusion of separation from God. Then why not trust that the memory of your love for God and His for you can close that gap? In Jesus' beautiful, poetic rendering of this thought:",
    "output": "\"What better way to close the little gap between illusions and reality than to allow the memory of God to flow across it, making it a bridge an instant will suffice to reach beyond? For God has closed it with Himself. His memory has not gone by, and left a stranded Son forever on a shore where he can glimpse another shore that he can never reach. His Father wills that he be lifted up and gently carried over. He has built the bridge, and it is He Who will transport His Son across it. Have no fear that He will fail in what He wills. Nor that you be excluded from the Will that is for you\" (T-28.I.15:3-9). The practice of forgiveness under Jesus' or the Holy Spirit's guidance is the means this course uses to restore this memory of God to our awareness. With this as our daily purpose, living in this world would be joyful and hope-filled rather than painful and isolating. As part of his answer to the question, \"How Should the Teacher of God Spend His Day?\" Jesus says in the manual that \"there is one thought that should be remembered throughout the day. It is a thought of pure joy; a thought of peace, a thought of limitless release, limitless because all things are freed within it\" (M-16.6:1-2). This echoes so many other encouraging statements in A Course in Miracles that he wants us to remember as we continue our journey. Being in touch with the truth in your mind-- even if this is just intellectual--means that you know you are not alone and can never be alone. Each day can be unified around the single purpose of seeing everyone as sharing with you the same wrong mind, the same right mind, and the power to choose between the two--regardless of the different roles and tasks we all have. All of that is just form; the content in your mind of undoing the separation alone is meaningful. Rather than leading to a sense of isolation and pain, this approach to living in the world offers hope of real and lasting peace; in fact, it guarantees it, as you would be undoing the remaining interferences to your experience of union with God. The concern with lifetimes and how many more lifetimes we must go through always comes from the ego, as part of its strategy to keep us thinking we are really here as bodies and that our problems and pain are rooted in the world. At best, we can use analogies drawn from our experience to try to understand this aspect of our process, but it is essentially not understandable, not only because it is all part of the illusion of separation, but also because it does not correspond to our experiences as seeming individuals in a world of time and space. On one level (Level One), we are either awake in eternity or asleep in a dream of time. On another level (Level Two), as decision-making minds within the dream we are always choosing between the ego's script and the Holy Spirit's correction of that script. We, as decision-making minds, choose which part of the script we will choose to review. To use the analogy of a movie, each of us is the writer, director, producer, and actor. Yet we are always re-experiencing something that has already happened, even though our experience is that it is happening for the first time. Jesus teaches us that if we focus on learning and practicing forgiveness, we will eventually remember our decision to forget that we are dreaming, and then will be free of the dream's effects: \"The miracle establishes you dream a dream, and that its content is not true. This is a crucial step in dealing with illusions. No one is afraid of them when he perceives he made them up. The fear was held in place because he did not see that he was the author of the dream, and not a figure in the dream\" (T-28.II.7:1-4). \"The Forgiven World\" in the text (T-17.II) gives us a lovely, comforting view of what our experience will be like when we see everything and everyone through the eyes of forgiveness. And for an extended discussion of the metaphysics of time, please see our book, Time: A Vast Illusion."

    "text_input": "Q #1012: In 1985 I had an extraordinary experience of oneness with God. I have never considered myself a religious person and never understood why people were religious. I came away from this experience believing to my very core in things that I didn't really understand, i.e., there is no sin, God is mind, do not judge, we are all one, etc. The experience was one of profound remembering where I belonged, and it surely wasn't here on earth. My path since then has been convoluted. After attempting to adapt my personal \"knowledge\" to other religions, I read and attempted to practice A Course in Miracles, but soon gave it up to turn to other things. I have recently had a renewed interest in the Course, but have many questions about my own personal experience and no one to talk to about it. Is this type of experience a common occurrence? A: There is no way of our knowing how many people have had such an experience. Not more than a few have mentioned something like this to us. There certainly could be many others who have experienced their oneness with God and now live quietly in peace with love being the sole source of their thoughts and activities. They would not have a need to talk about their lives, although they could be guided by love to do so. Jesus talks about the experience of union with God in the section in the manual called \"Can God Be Reached Directly?\" (M-26). You might find it helpful to read that, and also the earlier one entitled \"How Should the Teacher of God Spend His Day?\" (M-16). The focus of A Course in Miracles is on forgiveness, not God, even though He is mentioned on just about every page. The Course is about our daily practice of its lessons, rather than on experiencing oneness with God. It is nice when one has such an experience, as that provides a glimpse of the end of the process. But reflecting that oneness in the relationships of our lives is the immediate objective of the Course's teachings. We do that by first recognizing our wrong- minded dedication to seeing our interests as separate from others,' and then asking for help to shift that perception to shared interests, whereby we realize that we are all--without exception-- joined both in the pain of separation from God, and in our common call for help to awaken from that nightmare. Then, when \"not one illusion is accorded faith, and not one spot of darkness still remains to hide the face of Christ\" (T-31.VIII.12:5), our minds will rest in the peace and stillness of Perfect Oneness.",

Our government seems to be tightening its noose around our necks at every turn with all the new laws --and even more are coming.

For he's outside the dream and knows that all such thoughts simply reflect the Son's identification with the ego mind, which puffs itself up with threats of calamity and chaos and crisis in the world, so that we don't see the ego itself in our mind as the source of these so-called perils. For if we looked to this source, it would not take much more looking to see that we are observing a very puny little mouse of an idea, cowering in its fragility and impermanence, at the same time attempting to roar as a cover for its vulnerability (T-22.V.4). And then we could not help but smile ourselves, along with Jesus. But while we still want the world and our insignificant, separate selves to be real, we will have our reactions--our judgments and our anger and our fear. And Jesus does not ask us to deny how we feel, but rather asks us to use our reactions as a means for recognizing and acknowledging our continuing identification with the ego. For the ego has us convinced deep down of our own sinfulness and guilt, which demand our punishment. But preferably, the disasters will befall others instead of ourselves, as proof that the guilt lies elsewhere and no longer upon us. It's a very nasty thought system and the suffering that we are willing both to endure and to see as if it were being inflicted on others only attests to our own insanity. But it is through our willingness to look honestly at what we believe we could make real that our motivation to turn to Jesus and ask for another way to look at the world's insanity, with a smile rather than a frown or a grimace, can be reinforced."

    "text_input": "Q #1014: I have had psychic experiences and never paid much attention to them until now. I am trying to understand what they were for. Is it the contention of A Course in Miracles that there are no coincidences--that we get exactly what we ask for, and in this sense there are no victims and victimizers on the level of form? Is it also true that everything that seems to be given by another on the level of form--\"good\" or \"bad\"--we have asked for consciously or not, and therefore it is no coincidence that it shows up? Their ego takes it and gives you exactly what you asked for and you do the same in turn? A: The Course tells us that we are always \"reviewing mentally what has gone by\" (W- pI.158.4:5). It seems as if we are experiencing everything for the first time and that the thoughts in our minds are our own private thoughts. But this is only because we have chosen to identify with the ego's thought system that rests on the premise that separation and time and space are real. Keeping in mind that this is all an illusion, the Course explains that at the moment the separation from God seemed to happen, every conceivable form of separation spun out from that thought, and simultaneously the correction for each of those thoughts also spun out. The separation seemed to occur and was undone in the same instant. Not that we can understand any of this in our present state! So, in this framework, there are no coincidences and nothing happens by chance--everything has already happened. And as decision-making minds we are choosing which part of the \"script\" we shall revisit, or to use the analogy of a video library, we are choosing which video to watch. Everything is on the videos already; we choose what we are going to watch. The point of the teaching and mind-training exercises in A Course in Miracles is for us to learn how to bring into our awareness our decision-making capacity, so that we will realize what our lives are all about. Realizing that we are minds, we can then continue to choose the ego's version of the truth, or switch our allegiance and choose the Holy Spirit's thought system of forgiveness that will eventually return our minds to their natural state of undifferentiated oneness in God. Jesus discusses psychic powers in the manual for teachers (M-25). He talks about them in the context of the communication levels necessary for the process of salvation: \"Communication is not limited to the small range of channels the world recognizes. If it were, there would be little",
    "output": "point in trying to teach salvation. It would be impossible to do so. The limits the world places on communication are the chief barriers to direct experience of the Holy Spirit ... \" (M-25.2:2-5). These limits are a consequence of the separated mind's intention to block out anything that would remind it of the illusory nature of its existence. Thus, Jesus goes on to explain that the relevance of psychic abilities lies in the purpose for which they are used: as part of the ego's plan or the Holy Spirit's undoing of that plan. We have discussed different aspects of these issues in questions #589, #644, and #682, which you might find of interest."

    "text_input": "Q #1015: What is the difference between looking at resistance and not fighting it and being \"unwilling\"? I am a bit confused. Should I look at the resistance to doing a lesson and do nothing, or see that I am unwilling and overcome the unwillingness? I find myself at times resisting practicing the lesson because I am into something else. I recognize that I am resisting, but then again am I unwilling? A: For all practical purposes, resistance and unwillingness are the same; they keep the ego thought system in place and prevent the mind from choosing the Holy Spirit. The important thing is to be aware of the resistance/unwillingness and to acknowledge the underlying fear of love, without judging yourself for it. Knowing the depths of our fear, Jesus anticipates our resistance in the instructions he gives in the Introduction to the workbook: \"Some of them [the ideas] you may actively resist. None of this will matter, or decrease their efficacy ... whatever your reactions to the ideas may be, use them. Nothing more than that is required\" (W-in.9:2-5). Implicit in this passage is the message that we should not be surprised by resistance, not struggle against it, not judge it, but simply practice as instructed. Skipping a practice is merely wasting time, delaying the return to the awareness of love's presence (T-in.1:7). Since time was made as a delay tactic, we have as much time as we choose to take. As Jesus tells us in the manual: \" ... it is all a matter of time. Everyone will answer [the call to accept the Atonement] in the end ... \" (M-1.2:8-9). When we become convinced by our own experience that resisting love is extremely painful, we will gradually cease to resist. Willingness and motivation will then replace resistance/ unwillingness. We will begin to relinquish pain (the ego) and accept peace (the Holy Spirit). Meanwhile, the only thing to do with resistance or unwillingness is not to deny or fight it, but to wait with the patience of one who knows the outcome is certain (see T-4.II.5).",

Let's say I go about my day referring to my body, in my thoughts, in the third person, regarding it as a \"puppet\" of my ego mind in my sad, sad dream. Is there a flaw in this approach in the context of A Course in Miracles? As a recovering perfectionist/workaholic I can look back and see how the body was abused when used as a tool for achievement (a role or goal misperception). There is a broader view of this arena, so I ask: How to perceive the body (role, purpose, goals) so as not to abuse it?",
    "output": "Yes, the body can be viewed as a \"puppet\" of the mind, since it merely acts out the mind's decision to identify with it, using it as the expression in form of the mind's choice for separation. It is also referred to as a dream figure, which is somewhat more to the point because, as we know from our experience of nocturnal dreams, the people and events in a dream are not real. Although it is a figure in a dream, it is important to pay attention to the body's thoughts, reactions, and feelings. These specifics have been purposefully designed to fulfill the ego's goal of making the body real and keeping from awareness the mind's power to choose. Dissociating oneself from them without recognizing this ego strategy could short circuit the process of learning to accept responsibility for choosing the ego's use of the body. The Course teaches us to relate to the body as a communication tool to recognize the choice that has been made in the mind. Since identity with the mind and its power to choose have been forgotten, the body serves to show us the effect of the mind's choice, if we are willing to look. This statement about the world applies equally to the body and gives us the Course's perspective on it: \"The ego made the world [body] as it perceives it, but the Holy Spirit, the reinterpreter of what the ego made, sees the world [body] as a teaching device for bringing you home\" (T-5.III.11:1). When the mind chooses separation, it identifies with the ego and with the body, thus becoming the body in its experience of itself. Yet, the mind that has forgotten it is a mind can use the body as a communication device to recognize the effect of its choice. In the choice to identify with the body, it is the mind that is abused. It attacks itself by denying its true nature as spirit, and then exacerbates the attack by projecting itself onto the body obliterating from awareness all memory of its decision-making power. The ego always uses the body to reflect the mind's attack upon itself. It does not matter whether the attack is experienced in the form of punishment or pleasure, laziness or workaholism. The attack consists in the mind's belief that it is a body that can act and be acted upon. Of itself the body does nothing; it cannot suffer or enjoy independently of the mind. In fact, Jesus tells us in the text: \"At no single instant does the body exist at all\" (T-18.VII.3:1). It has no purpose of its own. In the service of the ego, the body is used to separate and attack. In the service of the Holy Spirit, it is a means of communication to remind the mind it is not a body. The goal is to learn to see everything the body experiences as the messenger of a decision made in the mind to listen to the ego or the Holy Spirit. Anything but perfect peace means the mind has chosen the ego, and can choose again. As the text tells us: \"If you use it [the body] only to reach the minds of those [including, and especially, one's self] who believe they are bodies, and teach them through the body that this is not so, you will understand the power of the mind that is in you. If you use the body for this and only for this, you cannot use it for attack\" (T-8.VII.3:2-3)."

Quite simply, it is likely that lying down at the end of the day or just before going to bed will induce sleep, which then prevents one from spending the quiet time he is recommending. It is also probably more comfortable than standing up. This is a very clear example of how Jesus takes into consideration our resistance, the nature of the ego, and the body's needs. He is helping us to find ways to make our best effort at complying with the structure set up in the workbook and reinforced here in the manual. Jesus knows that we are not always eager to learn what he is teaching us in A Course in Miracles. One of the ways our resistance is expressed is by falling asleep while reading it. He assumes that we must have noticed that we come up with all kinds of excuses and distractions for not doing the workbook lessons. Sleep is just one of them. He also assumes we are serious about our commitment to the practice of forgiveness, and so he gives us these helpful tips. That is all that is meant in this passage."

    "text_input": "Q #1018: I have a question regarding Gloria's \"myth\" in Awaken from the Dream. I'd like to understand a bit more about a point where she as a representative of the \"middle group\" is looking at physical reality and pledging that she'll endure any amount of suffering to get back into the dream and help others awaken. This, to me, seems to be a really important moment. Is judging the pain and suffering we are seeing, and feeling that it must be fixed, and that we are the ones to fix it--is that a wholly fallacious judgment? Is viewing the scene in that way purely the result of guilt (which is always of the ego)? Is guilt the key to the continual recreation of the dream for people like us? Could return to the dream be motivated by love? Ever? I feel like this is a really crucial question and want to be sure I understand it correctly. Would a bodhisattva or a reincarnated lama who has pledged to return endlessly until everyone is freed fall under that category? Or is it something else with them? A: Returning to the dream could definitely be motivated by love. We need to distinguish between the healed and the unhealed mind to get the proper perspective on this; and we need also remember that this cannot be understood from our very limited human perspective. Our human experience is the effect of the mind's choice to conceal its life as mind outside time and space, and so it can never be a reliable link to the truth. We must start there, for that is all we have to draw on; but Jesus cautions us regularly about using our experience as individuals as a criterion of what is real. He leads us beyond that to the dimension of mind we have sought to deny. The healed mind is totally free of guilt--it is no longer split into a right and wrong mind with a decision-making power. The healed mind is identified only with love and knows that anything else is illusory. That unrestricted love could then appear in the dream in a form recognizable by other figures in the dream seeking salvation. But this extension of love--this healed mind, this Teacher of teachers (M-26.2)--would not be experienced as a \"coming into the dream.\" It would simply be the form love takes. There would be no sense of having been sent on a holy mission to redeem or rescue souls, etc., and there would be no sense of sacrifice--of reluctantly returning to an unholy place of sin, for example. That mind would be joyous and at peace, knowing it is not in the dream at all, and recognizing as well that that is everyone's true reality. It would not respond to anything as though it were real and in need of \"fixing,\" although in form it would appear to be just like everyone else. It is important to recognize that this way of being does not correspond to any motivation known to us who experience ourselves as limited individuals competing for survival in a world with an overwhelming number and variety of problems. An unhealed mind would continue to take form in the dream in order to carry out its ego-driven objective of proving the separation real, projecting responsibility for it in an attempt to flee the punishment it thinks it deserves. An unhealed mind could also take form in order to continue to learn to awaken from the dream (a right-minded motivation). Again, we need to be wary of trying to conceptualize this in terms of our experience as humans. We can use analogies, as Jesus does, but all of this takes place only within the mind. There is not some non-physical entity somewhere that enters time and space as a body. This is always about the dynamics in a mind",
    "output": "that never ceases being a mind. We need to remember as well that we are attempting to diagram something that is inherently illusory. For the unhealed mind--still guilt-ridden--the world of separation would be perceived as a battleground of opposition between those protecting the separation and those seemingly imprisoned and trying to free themselves. If one perceives oneself as here to free those still imprisoned, or to switch metaphors, to awaken those still asleep, then one is sharing the perception of the ego. If something needs \"fixing,\" then the separation has been judged real -- the fallacious judgment you referred to. Jesus is helping us realize that our only responsibility is to accept the Atonement for ourselves, which means to realize that nothing happened--\"Not one note in Heaven's song was missed\" (T-26.V.5:4)--the separation from God never happened: Yet, as we make progress in this, we will begin to perceive everyone else in the same way--as here solely to learn this same lesson. If we are truly undoing the separation in our minds, it could hardly be otherwise."

Recently, I came across A Course in Miracles and have incorporated it into my life. I have tried to forgive myself and him, but it seems like the pattern is repeating. Even though I experience more of a sense of peace and less worry, I still don't know how to end this cycle or how to find the answer to what to do.",
    "output": "Having the intention to forgive is usually not enough, unless we have some understanding of just what it is we want to forgive. When we are new to the Course--typically at least the first thirty or forty years of our study and practice of it--most of us think we are trying to forgive others for what they are doing, and ourselves for getting caught in the traps that they have set for us. And that may not be a bad place to begin, because we have to start somewhere. But this must not be what Jesus has in mind by forgiveness in his Course, since he gives the following definition: \"Forgiveness recognizes what you thought your brother did to you has not occurred\" (W-pII.1.1:1). The fact is, what needs to be forgiven has nothing to do with other persons. They are simply the screen upon which we see our own seeming sin and guilt projected. But our ego has given them the purpose of being responsible for how we feel, so that we don't look within to the real source of our disquiet and conflict--our foolish choice for the ego with its accompanying investment in separate interests, attack, anger and guilt. We all think our partners, and friends, and enemies do things that upset us and rob us of our happiness and peace. But that's just how we've tried to set things up so we don't see that we are the ones who have already chosen to be upset and to throw our happiness and peace away, while the other person is just the convenient scapegoat for how we feel--regardless of what they may seem to have done! That's not to say that others don't say and do unkind, even cruel things. But I can only react personally to what someone else says or does if I have already made sin and guilt real in my own mind, believing I am a separate individual who can be attacked and hurt. Is it really possible to accept that this is true and recognize that blame and anger are never justified? Yes, but not if I attempt to come to that realization on my own. This will be a process in which, each time I remember after I've become upset, I am willing to acknowledge that I have made an interpretation about the situation and I am wrong! And so I want to be able to take my faulty perception to Jesus or the Holy Spirit and allow them to cleanse it of all my judgment and self-centeredness. And nothing in this process has anything to do with the other person or with what I should say or do with them. Now most of us can't simply allow things to remain as they are in our relationships without attempting to fix them, as we believe they need to be fixed. While there is nothing bad about doing this, it will be our ego's attempt to usurp control in the situation and diminish or minimize Jesus' role in the healing process, which happens only in our own mind, and not in the relationship between our body and the body of the other person. As soon as we shift our focus from the guilt in our own mind to the problem with our partner, we have become mindless. And we may find a temporary solution that seems to resolve the conflict, but we will have done nothing about the root cause of the conflict--our own sense of guilt and sinfulness. And so, as you say, it will seem as if the cycles of conflict keep repeating themselves, and we will not understand why. But little by little, as we are willing to acknowledge our own complete responsibility for how we are feeling and reacting, we will begin to release our investment in our guilt. And we will not be upset when the same issue seems to cycle back, but we will welcome it as a further opportunity to practice forgiveness and heal the pain in our own mind that comes only from our choice to see ourselves as separate and alone. As Jesus points out near the end of the text, and notice that he makes no mention of the other person in this process: \"Trials are but lessons that you failed to learn presented once again, so where you made a faulty choice before you now can make a better one, and thus escape all pain that what you chose before has brought to you. In every difficulty, all distress, and each perplexity Christ calls to you and gently says, 'My brother, choose again.' He would not leave one source of pain unhealed, nor any image left to veil the truth. He would remove all misery from you whom God created altar unto joy. He would not leave you comfortless, alone in dreams of hell, but would release your mind from everything that hides His face from you. His Holiness is yours because He is the only power that is real in you. His strength is yours because He is the Self that God created as His only Son\" (T-31.VIII.3)."

    "text_input": "Q #1020: At times I feel depressed and a bit fearful with the reality that this is all an illusion. I know it is my ego mind that is weighing me down, but this feeling can be very intense. What is going on?",
    "output": "What is going on is a normal reaction when someone is told that everything they think about the world is wrong. The mind begins to suspect that if the world is not real, then neither is the body with which it has chosen to identify. Doubt thus enters the belief system that holds the world and the body together, and that can only mean trouble for the ego. Feeling attacked, it defends itself, thereby attacking the mind. The attack brings on guilt in the form of depression, fear, anxiety, and every other form of misery experienced by the body. What is depressing is not the fact that the world is an illusion, but the belief that it is real. The problem begins when the mind chooses the separation, causing it to split into a wrong mind that believes the separation is real, and a right mind that knows it is not. The wrong mind (ego) defends and maintains its choice by identifying with the body and making the world real. The mind then becomes the body in its experience of itself, and feels intensely threatened by the message of A Course in Miracles that its made-up world/body is an illusion. The wrong mind that has identified with the body feels threatened by the right mind that knows it is not a body. This conflict in the mind is the source of the depression and fear that you experience. They are the inevitable effects of the split mind that is in conflict over its identity and perceives itself as separate from its Source. There is a part of the mind that knows it is wrong in identifying with the ego, but it is enticed by the autonomy of specialness. This is a depressing and fearful condition because it rests precariously on the made-up belief that illusion is reality. The mind knows this belief can be as easily abandoned as it was chosen Herein lies the cause of the predicament in which you find yourself, and its solution as well. The problem has its source and its solution in the mind's ability to choose between the ego's belief in separation and the Holy Spirit's memory of the oneness with God that has never changed. The ego has us believe that somehow happiness is possible in the world, while the Holy Spirit reminds us that nothing but our oneness with each other and with God will make us happy. The world is brought into awareness and held together by the belief that happiness can be found in it: \"No one who comes here but must still have hope, some lingering illusion, or some dream that there is something outside of himself [outside of the mind] that will bring happiness and peace to him\" (T-29.VII.2:1). In spite of all the evidence to the contrary, the ego insists there must be some way to keep the body, specialness, and the world, and still be happy. It seeks relentlessly to have its cake and eat it too. The fear and depression engendered by the split mind are further exacerbated by the fact that on some level we know this is impossible. Thus, underlying every pursuit of specialness is an inescapable sense of futility. Each quest ends in bitter disappointment and loss, for no matter how deceptively satisfying special love seems to be, it cannot last. And since we are told that only what is lasting can be real, and only what is real can bring us happiness, the ego's maxim \"Seek but do not find\" (T-16.V.6:5) is fulfilled. The world will not disappear from awareness as long as we want it. In this regard, Jesus tells us: \"Fear not that you will be abruptly lifted up and hurled into reality. Time is kind, and if you use it on behalf of reality, it will keep gentle pace with you in your transition\" (T-16.VI.8:1-2). Keeping these comforting words in mind while working with the Course will not only lessen the fear that impedes progress, but do much to relieve the distress you describe. The pace is gentle because we are not being forced to accept anything for which we are not ready. In His curriculum of forgiveness, the Holy Spirit respects our belief that the world is real. In fact, He uses the world as a classroom to teach us to forgive ourselves for taking the \"tiny, mad idea\" (T- 27.VIII.6:2) of separation seriously. Thus, chosen by the ego as a place to hide and forget God, the world can be used by the Holy Spirit to remember God and return to the home we never left. Therefore, release from depression in the face of the illusory nature of the world is found in changing the world's purpose from the ego's goal to the Holy Spirit's. The world itself, then, becomes an opportunity to find our way out of it through forgiveness: \"Forget not that the healing of God's Son is all the world is for. That is the only purpose the Holy Spirit sees in it, and thus the only one it has\" (T-24.VI.4:1-2)."

At my school, I am a peer-mediator and have helped tons of people with their conflicts. But I feel I no longer have any good advice to offer, because I now  believe in A Course in Miracles, and how am I supposed to help my family and friends with their problems without mentioning the Course? What can I say? What should I do? It hurts me a lot to know that I am not doing anything at all.",
    "output": "It is never easy to watch people self-destruct, especially those you are close to. But if the content in your mind reflects the Holy Spirit's thought system of forgiveness, you will automatically respond with love, no matter what the situation may be. Importantly, that loving response could be to do and say nothing, and to simply love them in your mind by not seeing them as victims. And just as importantly, as a Course student you can offer advice without ever using the language of the Course. Its principles and message always pertain to the content in your mind, not the form of expression. The issue is whether you are seeing the situation through the eyes of the ego or through Jesus' eyes. When you are in your right mind, looking through Jesus' eyes, you will perceive people as sharing with you the same wrong mind, right mind, and the power to choose between the two. You will realize that everyone is in intense pain and desperately hoping they are wrong about what they perceive as their unredeemable sinfulness. The answer is in their right minds, as it is in yours; and when they are ready, they will choose it. When you thus empathize with the strength in them, they are more apt to perceive you as standing for that alternative (M-5.III.2:6), even though you might not have said a word to them. The message would have been conveyed through that instant of your ego-less presence; and if their fear of healing has subsided enough, they will hear that message (M-5.III). If they do not hear it now, they will later, or from someone else. That is the point of Jesus' teaching that choosing forgiveness is our responsibility, but the extension of forgiveness or the miracle through us is not (T-16.II.1). If you thus concentrate solely on the content in your mind, you will not feel frustrated that you are not doing anything. The assumption you are making is that you must fix the problem, having defined both the problem and its solution. You will feel much freer and will be more open to the answer in your right mind if you drop that assumption. That will also lead you to respect the power of these people's minds to choose their ego and not to judge them for doing that, as you will realize they can use that very same power to choose against the ego. In this they are no different from you and everyone else. The form is irrelevant. This is the essence of true compassion and true empathy. We have discussed some of these ideas in Questions #45 and #647."

I now realize that the Course is designed for me, and that others will find their own paths. I once attended A Course in Miracles group meeting, part of a Christian following, and was surprised when the facilitator asked all to join hands and for everyone to focus and see if we could channel an entity. Unfortunately, at this time my ego stepped in and I told the group what I thought of their folly. That was my first and last meeting. I have thought that it would be nice to share the Course with others, but other than this Web site I travel my path alone. A: There may be no better way to learn the crucial distinction between form and content! You can practice forgiveness and relate to everyone in the context of shared interests without ever",
    "output": "using the language of the Course or discussing its metaphysics. That sometimes can be a more effective way of learning than meeting regularly with other Course students to share experiences and discuss the theory. There is nothing wrong with that, but it is not a necessary part of the completely internal process of shifting from the ego as your teacher to Jesus or the Holy Spirit. And if you are focusing on the content of our--everyone's--common journey home to God, you would not feel you are traveling alone. That is the whole point of the mind-training dimension of the Course, as Jesus eloquently states in one passage in the workbook: \"You want the peace of God. And so do all who seem to seek for dreams. For them as well as for yourself, you ask but this when you make this request with deep sincerity. For thus you reach to what they really want, and join your own intent with what they seek above all things, perhaps unknown to them, but sure to you ... It is this one intent we seek today, uniting our desires with the need of every heart, the call of every mind, the hope that lies beyond despair, the love attack would hide, the brotherhood that hate has sought to sever, but which still remains as God created it. With Help like this beside us, can we fail today as we request the peace of God be given us?\" (W-pI.185.10:1-4; 14:1-2) To get closer to this ideal each day can lead only to the undoing of all sense of aloneness and isolation. Your reaction to the group was not untypical of so many other Course students' experiences with groups. It calls to mind the gentle admonition Jesus gave to Helen one day when she was being very critical of the spiritual path another person had taken. It can easily be adapted to your experience. As related in Ken's Absence from Felicity, \"she suddenly heard the non-judgmental voice of Jesus say to her, cutting through her judgments: 'Don't take another's path as your own, but neither should you judge it.' In the presence of this loving and gentle correction for her judgment, Helen's anger quickly dissipated\" (p. 430). This is one of those directives that should be in the foreground of our minds as we meet the challenging situations of daily living."

I can tell myself the illness is an illusion all I want, but the little voice inside my head keeps telling me there is no God and A Course in Miracles is a hoax. I don't want to feel this way. I have asked the Holy Spirit to give me my own \"burning bush.\" How do we know God exists and that the Course is the word of God?",
    "output": "When going through something like the terminal illness of a loved one, most of us desperately long for comfort. While the message of A Course in Miracles--that the entire phenomenal world is a dream and we remain at home in Heaven--can be comforting, it is anything but comforting to the part of our mind that gets upset by events in this world. To the ego, the idea that everything here is an illusion is the most upsetting thought of all. Therefore, when we are in the midst of a major upset, the last thing we want to do is beat ourselves over the head with the idea that it is not real. Instead, we need to do whatever it takes to comfort and care for ourselves. Remember that the Course tells us \"it is almost impossible to deny [the body's] existence in this world\" and that to do so is \"engaging in a particularly unworthy form of denial\" (T-2.IV.3:10- 11). It further lets us know that anything we see as real in this world \"would persuade the holy Son of God he is a body, born in what must die, unable to escape its frailty, and bound by what it orders him to feel\" (T-31.VIII.1:2). In other words, the Course recognizes we are in a great deal of pain and does not ask us to pretend that we are not. Quite the opposite, the Course asks us to look at our pain honestly. We need to do this because we cannot pick and choose parts of our experience in which to believe. As long as we believe anything here is real--for example, that we see someone when we look in the mirror each morning--we have to admit that we think everything here is real. The very fact that we feel physical and psychological pain tells us how much we believe in the reality of our bodies and of this world. In truth, every time we take a breath, there is a little voice telling us that the Course is a hoax and God does not exist. If there were not, we would not need the Course and probably would not be here. So, one benefit of difficult times is, by amplifying the fear and pain that we always carry, they can make us keenly aware of what we really believe and how much better off we would be if we believed something else. The question is: What should we believe and how do we get ourselves to believe it? The Course does not claim to be the Voice of God. In fact, it tells us that \"God does not know of separation\" (P-2.VII.1:11). This means God could not possibly know about this world. Further, it states that \"the world was made as an attack on God\" and to be \"a place where God could enter not\" (W-pII.3.2:1,4). So, the Course does not come from God. What it comes from is the memory of God's Love that Jesus embodied and that remains in each of our split minds. The Course is not the ultimate truth, nor the only truth. It is a tool, inspired by God's non-specific, all encompassing Love. Its sole purpose is to remind us of that Love. And we could not be reminded of it (and moved by the Course's teaching) if we did not already know it. Jesus, the Holy Spirit, and God's Love: We need them, not in the world, but in our mind. Fortunately, that is exactly where they are. In other words, everything we need is already in our mind. This is why the Course makes statements like \"You always choose between your weakness and the strength of Christ in you\" (T-31.VIII.2:3) and tells us that \"the Holy Spirit is in the part of your mind that always speaks for the right choice\" (T-5.II.8:1-2). The Holy Spirit cannot give you a burning bush because the Holy Spirit is not external to you. But a burning bush is not what any of us needs. What we need is a way out of our pain. And for that, all we have to do is be willing to say, \"Maybe I am wrong\" and ask Jesus or the Holy Spirit in our mind to hold our hand and simply watch our pain with us without judgment. In so doing, we will see that though pain can feel crushingly real; even in the midst of it, there is a source of love, strength, and peace to which we can turn. That is all we need to believe. And what could be more comforting than that? So, let yourself be comforted--knowledge and understanding will follow."

    "text_input": "Q #1024: I have a question about Helen Schucman. I have noticed a lot of negative comments made about her final years. And the implication being that she died with an unhealed mind. And to me it seems that there is no way anyone could accurately determine what was going on in her mind, as we always judge by external appearances. And A Course in Miracles does tell us: \"Nothing so blinding as perception of form\" (T-22.III.6:7). Could you address this issue, and give your own feelings on this? A: Yes, it is not usually a good idea to make judgments about anyone--including oneself-- based on form or external appearances. We really don't know our own or another's path or where one is on it. A very moving account of Helen's final months and days appears in Ken Wapnick's Absence from Felicity, Chapter 18 \"Helen's Final Months and Requiem.\" As he did for the last eight years of her life, Ken spent considerable time each day with Helen and her husband Louis during her final days. Ken knew her well--especially the internal conflict between what she herself described as Heaven and Helen, and beyond even that dimension, her trans-human priestess Self. That priestess Self is the key to understanding everything else about her life. Ken thus states, \"And yet even though it did not appear to be so, I was certain that at the actual moment of her death Helen finally reached a peaceful resolution to her lifelong conflict with God\" (p. 471). He was with Louis when the call came from the hospital telling them that Helen had died. \"We returned to the hospital, and Helen was still in her bed. Her face had a remarkably quiet expression of peace, so different from the tortured disquiet we had grown so accustomed to seeing these many months. I suddenly recalled what Helen had shared with me on several occasions, a thought that always brought her great comfort. Jesus had told her that when she died, he would come for her personally. Who can really know what was in her mind in those closing instants? Yet her peaceful face was unmistakable, and spoke convincingly for an experience of knowing, at the very end, that her beloved Jesus had indeed kept his promise, as she had kept hers. The priestess had returned home\" (pp. 471, 472). Helen never thought of herself as a model to be emulated by other people. It made her most uncomfortable--to put it mildly--when people approached her in that light. She was never really a student of the Course--she knew it from within, as Ken has observed. She always directed people to their own inner guidance as their main source of strength. And that is Jesus' emphasis throughout his teachings as well. We can decide right here and now in this present instant to accept the Atonement. Nothing and no one outside us can deter us unless we want it so. In that sense, it should make no difference whether Helen got past her ego or not. Jesus tells us that \"our success in transcending the ego is guaranteed by God\" (T-8.V.4:4). The ego would seize any opportunity to invalidate anything that has the potential to expose its lies and deceptions. What holds us back is not Helen's or anyone else's seeming failure, but our own fear of the power of our minds to accept full responsibility for our condition of separation, and then to correct our mistaken decision and return home to God. What other people do or do not do should not influence one's own spiritual advancement.",

The more I understand this concept the more I find fault and people generally seem so pitiful in a  disgusting way to me. It was a lot easier when I thought I was so kind and loving towards others. I give it to the Holy Spirit for transformation and ask to see this as Jesus does, but some days I have to do that many times and it doesn't seem to be improving as time goes by.",
    "output": "It sounds like you have achieved two of the workbook's most important goals: paying attention to the mind, and awareness of the attack thoughts that are covered over with layers of \"niceness.\" This is no small accomplishment, however disconcerting it may be. Your study of the Course is paying off since you are no longer deceived by the \"loveliness\" of the ego's disguise. The Holy Spirit's thought system, as put forth in the Course, has the ego turned inside out. It is not easy to become aware of the hateful feelings that hide behind the socially acceptable and politically correct behavior the world requires. What appeared to be kind and loving in the past has been exposed as an attack. Such it is, simply because it is based on the perception of difference that emanates from belief that the separation is real, which is an attack on the Sonship by obliterating from awareness the oneness God created. Becoming aware of this attack is a very important step on the journey back to the mind that can choose against separation, just as it chose in favor of it. This is how we will find our way out of the ego's insanity to return to our home with God. So, you are heading in the right direction. Looking at your predicament in this light and without judgment will lessen the guilt that elicits the negative judgments towards others. Thus, what appears to be the descent into the darkness of negative feelings is actually an ascent out of the ego's mire. The important thing is not to judge yourself, but to acknowledge that what the Course reveals about the ego is true. By the same token, what it tells us about the memory of love in the right mind is also true. Therein lies our hope. Although it may seem to be quite powerful, the ego's hatefulness is not real. It is made up as a defense against the love that lies buried beneath it. Thus, it is fear of love that has brought forth awareness of the hateful feelings toward others. This can only mean that on some level you have acknowledged the love, otherwise you would not defend against it. Jesus reveals the ego's true fear when he tells us: \"You do not like it, but it is not your desire to attack that really frightens you. You are not seriously disturbed by your hostility. You keep it hidden because you are more afraid of what [love] it covers\" (T-13.III.1:6-8). If the viciousness of the ego's defense strategy is kept hidden behind the \"niceness\" of its deceptive ploys, it will never be brought to the healing light of forgiveness. Allowing yourself to see the hateful judgments brings the truth that much closer. In fact, looking at them without judgment is how to give them to the Holy Spirit, Who sees them as the projection of guilt for mistakenly choosing to take the thought of separation seriously. The ego, on the other hand, sees them as sinful, and relishes both the guilt and the hatred as proof that God's Son is no longer one with Him and the world is real. This is the Course's explanation for the feelings you describe. The next step is willingness to accept that this is what is going on, and that the feelings of disgust have nothing to do with the \"pitiful\" people out there. Thus, whenever you become aware of the judgments against others, all that is required is the simple acknowledgment that you chose the guilt of hostile feelings because you are afraid of love. If you do not judge yourself, the intensity of the feelings subsides. Little by little, the air is let out of the ego's inflated guilt balloon and it eventually goes flat. It can then be seen as \"a frightened mouse that would attack the universe\" (T-22.V.4:3), not a roaring lion to be feared. Therefore you are not more hateful since you have been studying the Course, you have simply tuned in to the roaring mouse. If you learn not to take it seriously it will grow weary and cease to roar. This will lessen guilt, which in turn will diminish the hateful feelings because they come from guilt. One of the most loving things we can do for one another is to acknowledge our mind as the true source of our judgments, and not the perceived \"pitifulness\" of others. Since this includes everyone, no one will be excluded from the true kindness of the non-judgment that follows. This, more than any of the false sweetness of the ego, is what we all truly need and long for."

    "output": "There are two parts to this statement. The first part--\"The ego is trying to convince you that it is real and I am not\"--is what we would expect of the ego, that it would try to convince us that separation, which the ego symbolizes, is reality, and oneness, which Jesus symbolizes, is not. The purpose of A Course in Miracles is to lead us to accept the Atonement for ourselves, which means that we come to recognize that the separation never happened. So if Jesus, as the symbol of oneness, is real, then the ego is not. Since the ego's only purpose is self-preservation, regardless of the truth, it must make every effort to persuade us that the Jesus of the Course is not real. The second part of the statement--\"because if I am real, I am no more real than you are\"--is another way of saying that if Jesus is real, we are all the same, and ultimately we are all one. The ego, confronted with the reality of Jesus, can only hope to persuade us that he is very different from us--God's only Son, divine, innocent while we are guilty, existing before us through all of eternity. If the Jesus the ego is willing for us to embrace were real, the ego could remain in business, for the separation would be confirmed. That is what has made Christianity and its central figure Jesus so popular across the centuries--they affirm the reality of separation and differences and sin, as well as attack and victimization. But the Course's message is that we are all the same because we are all one. There are no differences that mean anything. If the Jesus who is like us is real and exists, then the ego and all its perceived differences are meaningless. And sin and guilt are nothing but idle fantasies with no effects. And all of this, to the ego, is blasphemous."

I feel like I'm supposed to surrender my will and life over to the Holy Spirit and let Him run the show, but every time I try, I end up back making lists. I feel like I'm doing something wrong and it's creating a lot of tension in my life.",
    "output": "Fortunately, nowhere in A Course in Miracles does it say you cannot make to-do lists. Nor does it tell us to change our behavior or personality traits in any way. The Holy Spirit has indeed come to help us, but He will not pay the bills, wash the dishes, or clean the garage. Putting ourselves under the Holy Spirit's guidance means becoming mindful of the thoughts of judgment about ourselves and others that continually re-cycle the guilt in the mind for not choosing the Holy Spirit. The true source of tension is in the split mind that is in conflict between choosing the ego and the Holy Spirit. That is the real problem. The first thing on the Holy Spirit's list is to see the problem where it is (in the mind), not where it has been projected (making or not making lists). As long as we believe the world is real, there is a place for making lists and setting goals. Things need to be done. Jesus acknowledges this in The Song of Prayer: \"There are decisions to make here, and they must be made whether they be illusions or not\" (S-1.I.2:4) The important question to ask is with whom the decisions are made (see: \"Rules for Decision\" T-30.I). Guided by the ego, making lists and setting goals are activities driven by compulsion and need. The underlying belief is that salvation lies in the security of having lists and accomplishing tasks, and peace is lost when task goals are not set and met. They are thus used as attacks against peace. The Holy Spirit's goal is the healing of the mind, and the only task needed to achieve this goal is forgiveness. His help is not directed toward behavior of any kind, but with the mind that chooses to believe that certain behaviors are valuable and then judges that decision as sinful. Lists cannot keep you from Heaven any more than they can get you in, unless, of course, returning to Heaven is on the list. In that case, the work to be done is the practice of forgiveness, which begins with awareness of the judgments against oneself and others. Looking at these judgments with the Holy Spirit means seeing that their true purpose is to keep Him away. That is how we beat the ego at its own game, so to speak, and invite the Holy Spirit to be in charge. It is a process of learning to see everything, from making lists to accomplishing the tasks on the lists, as opportunities for forgiveness. If that is at the top of the list, everything will serve the Holy Spirit's purpose of healing, thereby putting Him in charge, rather than the ego."

I have been on this journey going on 8 years, and just when I think I finally got it, my whole world crashes in and I have to start all over again.",
    "output": "Many people feel the same way you do about their spiritual journey. And we agree with you that God would never subject His children to any kind of misery. That is exactly what the Course teaches. The true God only loves His Children and shares totally with Them all that He is. Any experience of feeling separate from Him must therefore be illusory. Unlike other spiritualities and most religions of the world, A Course in Miracles teaches that the true God has nothing to do with the world of separation in which we appear to live. Beseeching God's help and then trying to rationalize His apparent non-response to our plea rests on entirely false premises. It is a very difficult lesson to learn, but the essence of the Course's teaching is that it is only our own choice to be apart from God that is the cause of our lack of peace. Our resistance to learning this is far greater than we realize; but that is the source of our pain and what seems to make this such a difficult path. So our prayer to find God should really be addressed to ourselves; and what that means is that we would become more vigilant for the ways in which we are expressing the largely unconscious decision to prefer our existence as individuals with a special, autonomous identity rather than be the non-specific Self that God created at one with Him. This is what being a student of the Course entails. The lessons and exercises in the workbook are geared toward training us to see that our outer world is a reflection of this inner world of opposition to God's Will. The content of our wrong minds gets projected so that we wind up experiencing conflict, guilt, fear, victimization, despair, etc., and always fixing blame somewhere. But if we consistently choose against the ego, we will eventually be at peace regardless of the conditions in the external world. That is the ideal toward which we strive. Jesus assures us so many times in the Course that we cannot fail in this effort, for we are simply undoing a false belief system, and ultimately something that never truly happened in the first place. He tells us, for example: \"The outcome is as certain as God\" (T-2.III.3:10; T-4.II.5:8); \"Our success in transcending the ego is guaranteed by God, and I share this confidence for both of us and all of us\" (T-8.V.4:4). So you want to try to be more patient with yourself, accepting that your fear of being without your ego must still be too great; but that as you practice seeing your interests as the same as everyone else's, this fear will gradually subside. Then the peace of God abiding in your mind will return to your conscious awareness."

    "text_input": "Q #1029: In A Course in Miracles Jesus says: \"Make no one fearful, for his guilt is yours\" (T- 13.IX.2:2). I am a school teacher and I hate to say it but the only way that I can keep my classroom full of middle-school students orderly at times is to indeed make them fearful. For example, if my students do not fear that I will lower their grade or call their parent if they misbehave, they will have no motivation to behave as I need them to in class. How do I reconcile your oft-stated suggestion to not forget to be \"normal\" with Jesus' statement that I quoted above about not making others fearful? I see no other practical way to control my classroom at times but to use fear. I guess what I am really asking is: Can we lovingly be guided to use fear? A: You're suffering from another one of those form versus content confusions so common to Course in Miracles students! (You may wish to look at Questions #371, #452, #484 and #584 for further discussion of issues related to the ones you raise here.) First of all, to answer your closing question, we will never be lovingly guided to use fear as a way to change or control anyone for any purpose--not even 12- and 13-year old brats! For fear is the emotion/thought that is triggered and reinforced by our belief in our guilt (T-19.IV-A.10:1-4), which says we are deserving of punishment (T-26.VII.3:1; W-pII.259.1:4), and Jesus' main purpose in the Course is to help us undo our guilt and all its various expressions. So any intervention or manipulation intended to reinforce guilt and fear to achieve a specific end could never have originated from the right mind. Now that is not to say that we would never be lovingly guided to be firm or use discipline or the possibility of negative consequences in our dealings with others, especially with children and adolescents. And this brings us back to the central issue in the Course of purpose, which is always the determiner of the content of any of our decisions and subsequent actions. If our purpose is to see others as responsible for how we feel, then we have chosen to reinforce our own belief in separation, and we have turned to the ego as our teacher in the situation. But if our purpose is to remember that we all share the same interests, and acting out is only ever a call at a deeper level for the love that we all long to experience, then we have chosen to listen to the Holy Spirit as our guide. So how would this look in your classroom situation? If you are aware of some degree of anger towards your students for their misbehaving and feel a need to threaten them and punish them to get them to do what you want them to do, you can be certain that your ego is in charge. But if",
    "output": "you simply recognize that they are acting their age and that they need guidelines and limits, as well as consequences for crossing those limits, in order to be able to benefit individually and as a group from their learning environment that could very likely be a right-minded perspective. At the level of form, you may do and say the same thing to your students as you would when your ego is calling the shots, but your intent or purpose would be different. To set limits from a right-minded perspective, you must first be very honest with yourself about any ego-based feelings your have towards the class as a whole or towards any individual student or students. If you are aware of anger or even mild annoyance or irritation, any action against your students that you take in response to those feelings will be coming from your ego. And so you are the one in need of help. Your first step then would be to recognize that your upset has nothing to do with how your students are behaving or misbehaving. Anger is never a reaction to anything external, regardless of how justified it may seem (T-30.VI.1:1-2; M-20.3:3-4), but always represents a projection of our own unresolved internal conflict over the separation (T- 6.in.1:2-7). This is perhaps the most difficult step in the correction process to accept, given the value accorded to projection as a defense within our ego thought system. But once you can recognize and accept that your reactions are not to your students but to your own guilt, you can withdraw the projection from your students and begin to address the real issue in your mind. And that simply involves acknowledging that the anger has been a defense against accepting responsibility for how you feel, but that now you are willing to acknowledge that you are the one who decides how you will feel and react. Your next step simply involves taking the inner guilt that is behind your anger to Jesus and looking with him at its insubstantial nature (T-18.IX.5:2-4; 6; 8). Our guilt does not seem like nothing to us, and that is why joining with Jesus, who symbolizes the memory of oneness for us--which means he is the reminder that the separation and guilt are not real--is so essential to the looking process. When we allow ourselves to take that step, our anger and guilt disappear. It is at this point that you can then return your attention to your students, knowing more clearly what is the kindest, most loving way to keep or bring the class under control, since you no longer have any anger invested in the situation. It may involve setting limits, or you may also at times find that there could be a different way of structuring the class or framing the lesson that more readily elicits your students' participation and cooperation. And a different overall approach may evolve over time, as you are able to release your own obstacles to seeing more clearly. And should your guidance be to set some limits with consequences for your students, it may be helpful to know that you are not responsible for your students' reactions. Should they experience fear at the possible outcomes for crossing the boundaries you establish, their fear, much like your anger, is not the result of the external limits you have set, but rather is a projection of their own unresolved guilt. Fear after all need not be the only reason for respecting the limits, and you can set clear limits without intending to arouse guilt and fear, if you have done your part first to recognize and release your own ego investments in the situation."

    "text_input": "Q #1030: I've stopped thinking about inconclusive questions that we cannot answer with our minds. One thing that did it for me is that I realize that we find a witness to our own innocence, not in ego but as in Self. And most of all, I read A Course in Miracles as a prime source of our  understanding/perception, until we arrive with knowledge which just IS. Herein lies forgiveness of the world. What do you think?",
    "output": "Yes, the process is easy in this sense. We first choose to identify with either the hatred of the ego in our wrong minds or the love of Jesus or the Holy Spirit in our right minds. Then our experience of the outer world will reflect this experience of our inner world. It is a significant step forward to realize that our internal experiences are never anything other than expressions of the choice we have first made in our minds. Our unfortunate mistake has been to take for granted that our experiences are caused by what happens externally, and so our lives have been geared toward changing the world so that we may be happier and more peaceful. In \"The Savior's Vision\" Jesus tells us: \"For holiness is seen through holy eyes that look upon the innocence within, and thus expect to see it everywhere. And so they call it forth in everyone they look upon, that he may be what they expect of him. This is the savior's vision; that he see his innocence in all he looks upon, and see his own salvation everywhere\" (T-31.VII.11:3-5). The world is thus forgiven, because we no longer see it as the cause of our problems and lack of peace. This is what is meant when Jesus says in this same section in the text, \"The savior's vision is as innocent of what your brother is as it is free of any judgment made upon yourself. It sees no past in anyone at all\" (T-31.VII.13:1-2). When you identify with your innocence (the Atonement principle), you know that everyone else is included in that innocence, as God's Son is one; and therefore you see past all the differentiating forms that would tempt us to think otherwise. The varied conflicts and problems may continue in the world, but you would have released them from all responsibility for your internal condition. And you may be participating in resolving some of those problems, but you would be doing so solely as a means of having that vision of innocence encompass everyone, without exception."

    "text_input": "Q #1031: This question is with reference to #724ii. Many religious beliefs and spiritual paths say that God created this world or constantly creates it through us. The Course says otherwise, and I think this is what distinguishes it from other belief systems. However, if you say that we cannot think apart from God, then the \"little\" things we witness in this world must also be part of, not just us as dreaming Sons of God, but also of God Himself, from Whom we never separated. So one could be tempted to say that the world is made of (part of) God having fallen asleep rather than \"only\" the sleeping Son of God. Would it be apt to say that God is \"the canvas\" upon which all the playings and going-ons of the world take place? A kind of background picture that never changes? God is Love, and then we cease to speak? A: If the world, in any sense, were part of God, the world would be real. And the Course states unequivocally that it is not real: \"There is no world! This is the central thought the course attempts to teach\" (W-pI.132.6:2-3). The teachings of A Course in Miracles are presented on two levels. Level One teachings state the absolute truth: The world of Heaven alone is real--God, Christ, and His creations; all else is illusory and not real--anything with limits, which includes everything material, temporal, and spatial. We think we are real as bodies existing in a physical world, so Jesus speaks to us on that level (Level Two), but only so that he can help us realize that our identity as individual selves is part of a delusional thought system intended to keep the truth",
    "output": "about us concealed. God would not be God if a delusional system were in any way part of Him or even known by Him; and certainly He would not be perfect as God if part of Him fell asleep. To say that \"we cannot think apart from God\" is to say that our reality as Christ alone is real, and therefore any thoughts we seem to have as autonomous individuals cannot be our real thoughts. This is the point of two lessons in the workbook: \"My mind is part of God's. I am very holy\" (W-pI.35) and \"God is the Mind with which I think\" (W-pI.45), where Jesus speaks to us on Level One: \"There is no relationship between what is real and what you think is real. Nothing that you think are your real thoughts resemble your real thoughts in any respect. Nothing that you think you see bears any resemblance to what vision will show you\" (W-pI.45.1:3-5). The \"you\" Jesus is addressing is the decision-making aspect in our minds that has denied our true Identity and made up another identity as an individual self in this world. In the exercises, therefore, Jesus helps us get back to that decision-making power of our minds so that we would realize another choice is available to us--we can choose to identify with our right minds where the Holy Spirit holds for us the memory of our true Identity. Thus, our thoughts right now can be reflections of the ego's thought system of separation or the Holy Spirit's thought system of oneness. That distinction reflects the Level Two teachings in the Course. When we no longer choose thoughts of separation, which means we give no credence to the differences in form among us, our minds will be one with the Holy Spirit's and then our thoughts will reflect only the perfect Oneness of God's Love. In sum, then, in truth we cannot think apart from God, because there is no \"we\" apart from God. If we think we are apart from God, then our thoughts are not real thoughts."

    "text_input": "Q #1032: Would the following concept be consistent with the teachings of A Course in Miracles?: \"We live in the spirit; mind is the builder; and the physical is the result\"?",
    "output": "Not exactly. The mind that knows itself as spirit lives in God, it would not, therefore, build a world to escape to. Because only the mind is real (T-6.V.A.3:2), and the world is but an hallucination (T-20.VIII.7:3), they cannot be set equally in the sequence. It is more accurate to say that the mind hallucinates the world into awareness in order to defend its choice for the ego. Thus, the statement could read: we are Mind/spirit, the mind chooses against its identity as Mind/spirit, forgets its choice, projects the guilt outside of itself, and experiences an illusory world that it then uses to prove it is not a mind. Therein lies the insanity of the ego thought system. Once the mind believes this thought system is real, its only activity is choosing between it and the thought system of the Holy Spirit. When the split mind chooses separation, guilt for that choice is projected out resulting in the illusion of the physical world. Thus, the mind \"builds\" only in the sense that the world is the effect of the mind's projection of guilt. It then identifies with the body in which it thinks it lives, forgetting that it is a mind. When the mind chooses the Holy Spirit, it identifies with the part that knows the separation is not real. This choice is then extended and experienced in the world as right-minded thinking. When the mind chooses only the Holy Spirit, it will be completely healed and cease to perceive anything outside of itself. It then lives in the spirit, aware only of its oneness with God. That is how the world disappears from awareness (C-4.4). In reality, none of this is true because the separation never happened (T-6.II.10:7). There is no separated mind, no world (W-pI.132.6:2), nothing to build. While we choose to believe the separation is real, the world will remain real in our perception. Belief in separation and belief in the world go hand in hand as cause and effect. Each depends on the other for its seeming existence. The goal of the Course is to teach us to see the world as the projection of the mind, and to replace the mindlessness of the body with the mindfulness of paying attention to the thoughts of separation that fill our days with judgment. Looking at these thoughts with willingness to let the Holy Spirit transform them is the only useful purpose for the world we perceive. It is the way we live in the spirit until we return to our true life in the spirit of God."

    "text_input": "Q #1033: Music, especially classical music, is an aspect of that state I like to think of as pertaining to my right mind. Jesus uses such terms as a song of thankfulness, praise, union, gratitude, Heaven; and in \"The Forgotten Song\" (T-21.I) there is a particularly lovely analogy to help us understand the beauty of what we have forgotten. Sometimes I wonder if there is some subtle reference in A Course in Miracles to a particular type of music or composer or work that would reflect these melodies to which he refers as we dream our dream of beautiful music here. A: It is always the content of what Jesus is saying that he is trying to draw us into, never the form. Form is always specific and even though we would love for him to deal with specifics, that really would not be in our best interests. Our record with specifics is not very impressive, when you think about it. Isn't it true that if he gave us specific musical references we would immediately get into comparisons, debates, etc., and just stay stuck on that level? Then, too, different forms appeal to different people; one is not better or more inspirational than another. One person may have an instant of selfless joining while listening to a Neil Simon song and not relate at all to Beethoven's \"Ode to Joy.\" So form can never be prescribed universally. Love may guide one person one way and another person in a completely different way. The real reason Jesus does not get into specifics, however, is that he does not recognize them as meaningful. Specifics and form always pertain to the body, whereas content pertains to the mind. The Shakespearian meter of the Course's form makes for lovely reading, but it has nothing to do with the content--it could have been expressed in any number of other forms. Jesus reminds us in \"The Forgotten Song\" that \"the notes are nothing\" (T-21.I.7:1). This is consistent with his pattern of bringing us ever closer to the essence of love--oneness--that transcends anything in this world of form. But if a certain type of music or certain composers or pieces inspire you and help you to be more peaceful, then it would be foolish not to enjoy listening to them. Just try to relate to the content, which in some way should remind you of the ego-less Presence within you that lovingly embraces everyone, without exception.",

That is its function. Never attempt to overlook your guilt before you ask the Holy Spirit's help. That is His function. Your part is only to offer Him a little willingness to let Him remove all fear and hatred, and to be forgiven\" (T-18.V.2:1-5) Does this mean that we do not need to forgive ourselves before we approach the holy instant and that we do not need to forgive ourselves before we ask the Holy Spirit's help? Does this mean that all we need to do is open ourselves a little bit with our \"little willingness\" and the Holy Spirit will take care of the rest? That the Holy Spirit will then teach us how to forgive ourselves and will then teach us how to change our fearful dreams to \"happy dreams\" on the way to awakening?",
    "output": "The first part of your question is asked by just about every student of A Course in Miracles. It is founded on a belief system that tells us dreams are real, that they have an unhappy effect on the dreamer, and that God is to blame for this miserable state of affairs. This belief system is shared by all the Sonship once the thought of separation is taken seriously. It rests on the declaration that the separation did indeed occur and has had disastrous effects. Furthermore, God is not only responsible for this, He won't do anything about it. Herein lies the ego's woeful tale of separation. Once the mind chooses to believe that separation is possible, the creative power that it shares with its Source is expressed in the ability to choose between separation and Oneness. However, choosing between what is real (oneness) and what is not real (separation) is not a real choice. It is the denial of one and acceptance of the other. Denial of truth is what the Course calls a misuse of the mind's creative power, while free will is defined as the choice for truth/denial of error: \"Denial of error is a strong defense of truth, but denial of truth results in miscreation, the projections of the ego. In the service of the right mind the denial of error frees the mind, and re- establishes the freedom of the will. When the will is really free it cannot miscreate, because it recognizes only truth\" (T-2.II.2:5-7). Thus, choosing the ego's unhappy dream is the denial of free will. Since \"God does not know of separation\" (P-2.VII.1:11), He is unaware of the Son's \"choice\" or of any will that is not the Will He shares with him. Neither can we speak of God as desiring anything for His Son, for desire implies need or some sense of lack. In the non-dualistic state of perfect Oneness that God shares with His Son, there is no need or lack of any kind. He knows only perfect Oneness, perfect Love, one Will shared with His Son. This is a unitive state that is impossible to understand from within the dream of duality. While we still believe the separation is possible, the Course meets us where we think we are by describing our seeming separated condition as a dream the Son has while he remains at home with His Father (T-13.VII.17:7), Who is unaware of the nightmarish escapades and adventures of the dream. You are absolutely right, all that is required of us is willingness. In fact, the passage you quote is saying that we should not do anything except be willing. We cannot forgive ourselves, nor remove the guilt, fear, and hatred from our minds. What we can do is become aware of our need for forgiveness by being willing to look at our judgments as projections of guilt for having chosen separation. The choice is forgotten until we see the judgments. The miracle of forgiveness begins with willingness to recognize them as the projections they are, rather than justify them by shifting blame outside the mind and on to external agents. That is enough for us to do because in itself it is not as easy as it may seem. The world is a fertile battleground, bombarding us with \"legitimate\" external reasons for lack of peace. It is no small thing to learn to accept that nothing external to the mind can take peace away. That is probably why Jesus thought \"miracle\" was a good word for his teaching on forgiveness. When we do our part, the rest follows without further effort. Trying to do anything more, simply means we have put ourselves in charge of the Atonement, which ensures that we will not accept it. In this regard it is always helpful to remember the one task we have been given: \"Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all of the barriers within yourself that you have built against it\" (T- 16.IV.6:1)."

    "text_input": "Q #1035: Lately I've been observing my \"sleeping dreams\" versus \"waking dreams\" from the point of view of A Course in Miracles and my understanding of \"dreaming\" has deepened a bit. Although not always, it sometimes helps me to put \"the problems in this world\" in the right perspective. In Kenneth Wapnick's audio album \"Cause and Effect,\" he mentions this line: \"A dream is a wish fulfilled.\" Could you please elaborate?",
    "output": "A significant part of Freud's work is based on his theory that the dreams we have at night are fulfillments of wishes--that we hold secret wishes in our minds which then manifest in our nocturnal dreams. Jesus is saying the same thing, except that he generalizes this to include our entire lives, as well as the \"life\" of the entire physical universe. Thus, we \"are at home in God, dreaming of exile but perfectly capable of awakening to reality\" (T-10.I.2:1). Our lives in this world are parts of this dream of being separate from God. This is illusory, of course, as separating from Infinity and Perfection is impossible; but since we think we are really alive in this very real world, Jesus uses the analogy of the dream to help us return to our original, unchanged state as one with our Source. He teaches us how to become \"lucid dreamers\"--a gradual process of bringing back into our awareness the power of our minds to decide to awaken from this dream of separation or to stay asleep, oblivious to the fact that we are the dreamers of our own dreams. What keeps us from awakening, however, is our secret wish to keep our individual existence but to project blame for it onto something or someone else. This is the cause of our feeling victimized and unfairly treated in our lives (the effect). It is an absolutely bizarre strategy, but our secret wish is fulfilled within the dream every time we feel we are suffering unjustifiably at the hands of another. Because we keep this wish buried, it appears as if we are innocent victims; but we are anything but innocent. Contrary to our experience, the world is not the cause of our misery and problems. \"Perception is a result and not a cause\" (T-21.in.1:8). The world with its potential for inflicting suffering and the bodies within the world that can be so afflicted are both the fulfillment of the mind's secret wish to have an existence of its own but to make it appear that it is not responsible for it. Correcting this delusion is the objective of Jesus' curriculum in his course. But the effectiveness of this correction rests on our willingness to question the validity of our perceptions about ourselves and the world. We must get to the point where we are open to viewing ourselves and everyone else in the world--and the very world itself--as figures in a dream. For further study, we refer you to some sections in the text that discuss these ideas: \"The Basis of the Dream\" (T-18.II); \"The Dreamer of the Dream\" (T-27.VII); \"The 'Hero' of the Dream\" (T- 27.VIII)."

    "text_input": "Q #1036: I have only been studying A Course in Miracles for six months but previously have read David Hawkins, Ken Wilbur, and studied some things on quantum physics. Before I came to A Course in Miracles, I was having strong feelings of love for everything from bugs to trees to people. I saw their forms as cute, implying childlike innocence. It wasn't as if I was denying their propensity for attack, but I found people responding to me with kindness and friendliness so I didn't see this side to them. You stated in an audio program that in the ego world we created children to appear innocent so that the blame can be projected outward. (I hope I'm interpreting you correctly here). Now, I'm confused on how to feel love toward people and animals. Am I  loving their form? Am I able to see spirit in form even if form doesn't exist and is just a projection? Where do I direct the intense feelings of love that sometimes wash over me?",
    "output": "If these intense feelings of love embrace everything and everyone and exclude nothing and no one, then they are coming from the part of your mind that remembers the oneness of God's Son, which transcends form. Spirit is never in form, as form is inherently illusory. Form issued from the separated Son's mind as a means of obliterating any awareness of oneness, thereby validating his existence as separate from God. Jesus describes this mistake as \"the substitution of illusion for truth; of fragmentation for wholeness. It has become so splintered and subdivided and divided again, over and over, that it is now almost impossible to perceive it once was one, and still is what it was\" (T-18.I.4:2-3). Bodies, with their senses, were made to perceive only form, and so we cannot rely on them to put us in touch with the truth. We can turn inward to our minds, however, where we can choose to regard everything of form as symbols that can either reinforce our belief in the reality of separation or help us undo that belief. In other words, our focus shifts from the forms themselves to the purpose they serve--the purpose of the ego or the purpose of the Holy Spirit. This is the shift from form to the content in our minds, which is the function of the miracle. Even though, on one level, all form represents an attack on the perfect formlessness of reality--\"the body is a limit on love ... it was made to limit the unlimited\" (T- 18.VIII.1:2-3)--on another level, \"love does not condemn it and can use it lovingly, respecting what the Son of God has made and using it to save him from illusions\" (T-18.VI.4:8). This is the gentle way of the Course and of Jesus, the teacher in our minds to whom we can turn for help in making this shift. Lesson 151 in the workbook is especially helpful in contrasting these two ways of perceiving. It helps us see how we have gotten ourselves stuck by using our senses as the chief means of judging what is real and true and lovable, and why we did that. Then Jesus teaches us to turn to the Holy Spirit within, Who will help us perceive truly, a process that will gradually \"bridge the gap between illusions and the truth\" (W-pI.151.9:7). Near the end of this journey, as we advance spiritually, our perception will be one with the Holy Spirit's, Who sees everyone as either expressing love or calling for it. In the earlier stages of our spiritual growth, Jesus tells us that we \"cannot safely make this division, for ... [we] are much too bound to form, and not to content\" (T-14.X.7:2-3). Learning to thus distinguish between form and content is an essential step in the process of restoring to our awareness our true Identity as God's one Son. So your intense feelings of love can be directed inward to the content in your right mind, where you go beyond form and differences to the love that reflects the perfect Oneness of God's Love."

Since that time, I have been reviewing my life and experiencing and reevaluating every relationship, both painful and joyful. I understand so much, and still I am longing for that \"feeling\" again. I have a difficult time sharing my journey back to Heaven with those I come in contact with. Some believe me, but doubt my sanity; some ignore me, some want to believe me but are afraid of change; many misunderstand me and my intentions. I feel like Jesus did during his time. Wasn't he alone and frustrated? How do I help heal all our wounds when others don't seem to want any help and resent any implication that they need help?",
    "output": "The way you can be most helpful to others in your life is to remain vigilant in your own mind for anything that keeps them separate from you, and then to trust that when they are ready they will let go of their egos and accept back into their awareness their true Identity. It could be that you are reinforcing the differences between you and your friends by focusing on their \"wounds,\" instead of identifying with the power of their minds to choose their egos, and respecting that choice. Identifying with the power of their minds and respecting their choice to choose their egos is an effective way of joining with them in your mind, as that would reflect your own process, and then the differences between you would fade away. In that instant of joining, love would simply flow through you and take the form that is most helpful right then. It is not necessary to explicitly call attention to other people's wounds. Most people would not take kindly to that. When you are beyond your ego, you would know that they are as well: \"When I am healed, I am not healed alone\" (W-pI.137). Jesus was not frustrated, nor did he ever feel he was alone--those are effects of believing you are a body, and Jesus knew he was not a body, even though everyone related to him that way. The major lesson he was teaching, and still is, is that nothing happened in reality to separate us from our Father; we only believed something happened. So by focusing on people's wounds and then trying to heal them, we would be doing exactly what he wants us to avoid doing: making the error real. In the Course he uses the term unhealed healers for those who see error as real and then set out to correct it (T-9.V). Just as he instructed Helen, the scribe of A Course in Miracles, he urges us not to decide on our own who needs healing and how to go about it, but rather to ask him which miracles we are to perform. If our own minds are not healed--for just an instant of being beyond our egos--our perception will be distorted, and we will not be clear and clean channels through which his healing love can flow. Jesus stood for the Alternative (M-5.III.2:6). He reminded others--just by his presence--of their wholeness and innocence. His non-judgmental presence was enough; words were not necessary, and if there were words, as there are in this course, they would simply be the form that love takes for those too fearful of love's direct, formless presence. He asks us to do that with the people in our lives--just be the loving, non-judgmental presence that stands for the Alternative. Remember Jesus' description of forgiveness: \"Forgiveness ... is still, and quietly does nothing ... It merely looks, and waits, and judges not\" (W-pII.1.4:1-3)."

    "text_input": "Q #1038: At the beginning of A Course in Miracles, Jesus talks about mind and spirit. Could you please explain, as I always thought it was mind ... but either wrong mind or right mind?",
    "output": "The terms Mind and spirit refer to the true identity of God's Son, and are used in contrast to the body identity of the ego thought system. Though both terms are contrasted to the body, there is a slight distinction between them as they are used in the Course: \"Whatever is true (our identity as spirit) is eternal, and cannot change or be changed. Spirit is therefore unalterable because it is already perfect, but the mind can elect what it chooses to serve\" (T-1.V.5:1-2). Thus, spirit refers to our true identity as God's one Son, which is changeless, and remains unaltered by the mind's seeming escapade into the insanity of separation. In truth, God's Son, whose only reality is spirit (T-1.III.5:5), cannot split off and be separate from his Source (T- 7.V.6:15). The term mind, however, is used to help us understand the seeming separation. We are told that a \"tiny, mad, idea\" (T-27.VIII.6:2) entered the mind of the Sonship, and was taken seriously. When the mind chose to believe that separation was possible, it split into a right mind, a wrong mind, and the power to choose between them. This is the Course's explanation of an event that never occurred (M-2.2), in which we believe we can have an identity (body) other than the one given us by God. One of the important goals of the Course is to teach us that we are mind/spirit, and that neither is found in the body. That is why the most frequently repeated phrase in the Course is: \"I am not a body\" (W-pI.84.1:4). Clearly, Jesus is making a point. In fact, the practice of forgiveness rests on learning to see every experience as the reflection of the mind's choice to believe in the ego's separation (wrong mind) or the Holy Spirit's oneness (right mind). It is only in practicing forgiveness in this way that meaning is given to the terms used in the Course. Each application of the mind training we are taught in the workbook breathes life into our forgotten identity as spirit. Eventually the body will be forgotten, the mind will be healed, and only spirit will remain."

    "text_input": "Q #1039: As a mail man, I meet the public daily, and I am in a quandary about my brother who asks me for money daily. I know there are no chance meetings. At first I perceived he needed monetary assistance. I then JUDGED that he was freeloading. Is my lesson to give all the time (he looks for 5-dollar bills) because the Son of God has it all? I finally told him I couldn't give any more because I can't afford it. I felt terrible about it for a while, until I conceded I just don't have the faith required to give like that, and knowing the One Who Knows keeps working with me. My brother stopped asking me but I know I'll come to this crossroads again. A: Your decision to stop giving away money you can't afford to give seems to be a good one. When A Course in Miracles tells us we have everything, it is referring to the only need we truly have, which is our need for the Holy Spirit, Who represents the right mind. In other words, having a right mind that holds the memory of God is everything. It is all we truly need. Obviously, this has nothing to do with meeting physical needs, our own or someone else's. However, while we identify with the body, its needs must be met. Having our one true need met through the presence of the Holy Spirit does not mean that we have an unlimited supply of physical things, such as money. So, there is nothing wrong with using common sense in the distribution of funds, while at the same time seeking the guidance of the Holy Spirit to search the mind for thoughts that reflect the choice for separation. Whenever guilt enters awareness, it means the mind has chosen separation, regardless of the apparent external catalyst for the guilt feeling. In choosing to be separate from God, the mind decides to be author of a separate identity, thereby stealing authorship from God. The insanity of this delusion of creative power is the source of tremendous guilt that is projected out of the mind onto a situation in the dream; e.g. meeting a brother in need of financial assistance. In the ego's twisted thinking, his need is perceived as the result of his somehow having been robbed of his rightful share of earthly goods. Fundamental to the ego's thought system is the belief that in order for someone to gain, another must lose. Thus, if this brother doesn't have what I have, I must have stolen it from him. Since stealing power from God is how the separated self came into being, whatever I have, I stole. That is why it is so common to experience guilt when confronted with those who are deemed less fortunate. Once this system is set in motion, one misperception follows another. Resentment for having been exploited by a freeloader follows the choice to give",
    "output": "money; guilt for being selfish and unkind follows the choice not to give money. We come to this vicious circle whenever we decide to listen to the ego. You can't win on the ego's turf. The only way out of this unwinable situation is willingness to pay attention to the feelings and judgments that come up in any situation, seeing in them the effect of the mind's decision to be separate. What the ego ultimately goes for is the turmoil of guilt that keeps the mind rooted in the world's dilemmas, rather than the quiet peace of the right mind. Every situation can be transformed when a decision is made to choose the Holy Spirit instead of the ego. The question then becomes, to whom will I listen: the ego or the Holy Spirit? The specific behavior of giving or not giving is of no concern to the Holy Spirit. His agenda is only the content of the mind that has the power to choose to remember or forget its identity as mind. The crossroads in every situation consists in one road that leads to the guilt of the ego's thinking, and one that leads to the peace of the Holy Spirit. Whether you give or don't give, the ego's road is paved with the guilt that originates in the mind that chose the ego, not from the act of giving or withholding a hand- out. Likewise, choosing the Holy Spirit brings peace whether you give or not. The mistake lies in thinking that the external circumstances can generate or abolish guilt, or have any effect on the mind whatsoever: \" ... all external things are only shadows of a decision already made\" (P-2.IV.2:4). This fact rests on a very fundamental principle of the Course's teaching: \"Ideas leave not their source\" (T-26.VII.4:7). That is why there are no specific guidelines for behavior in the Course. Rather, it teaches us to see everything in our lives as an opportunity to shift the focus back to the mind by becoming aware of its thoughts and judgments. That is how we begin the practice of forgiveness in every situation in which we find ourselves, which is the only meaningful thing we can offer another. What we all truly need is the healing of our minds of the thought of separation, and until our minds are healed we are all begging for forgiveness. Remembering this frees us to be guided by the Holy Spirit to give a few dollars or not, without the burden of the ego's guilt."

    "text_input": "Q #1040: Regarding parts of #167: Since we are only ever \"reviewing mentally what has gone by\" because \"this world was over long ago,\" what is the point of forgiveness unless through forgiveness one (any individual mind/body) can actually skip over part or all of this dream/illusion by forgiving everything all at once, if that is possible, and just really let this whole world/cosmos truly be over and done with?  And the concept of enlightenment/awakening is a conflict-maker for me because I do not understand how one can be both awake and asleep (this \"awake in the dream\" concept), because either one is awake and not dreaming or one is asleep and dreaming.  And since both Jesus and A Course in Miracles are also illusion/dream, which is telling the illusory student/reader that he/she doesn't really exist as anything other than a dream character in some dreamer's dream, how can one trust anything at all in this worldly experience, including Jesus and the Course? It seems to me that all dreams are unreliable since they can and do change in an instant and if we are truly just dream characters, everything that seems to happen to us isn't up to us dream characters at all.",
    "output": "Addressing your questions in the order you present them: yes, forgiveness, also referred to in the Course as the miracle, allows us to skip over part or all of the dream. For most of us, our forgiveness in any instant is incomplete or partial and so we skip over only part of the dream. Jesus discusses this time-saving nature of the miracle a number of times very early in the text: \"The miracle is a learning device that lessens the need for time. It establishes an out-of-pattern time interval not under the usual laws of time\" (T-1.I.47:1-2). And a few pages later: \"The miracle minimizes the need for time. In the longitudinal or horizontal plane the recognition of the equality of the members of the Sonship appears to involve almost endless time. However, the miracle entails a sudden shift from horizontal to vertical perception. This introduces an interval from which the giver and receiver both emerge farther along in time than they would otherwise have been. The miracle thus has the unique property of abolishing time to the extent that it renders the interval of time it spans unnecessary. There is no relationship between the time a miracle takes and the time it covers. The miracle substitutes for learning that might have taken thousands of years. It does so by the underlying recognition of perfect equality of giver and receiver on which the miracle rests. The miracle shortens time by collapsing it, thus eliminating certain intervals within it. It does this, however, within the larger temporal sequence\" (T-1.II.6). In the next chapter, Jesus elaborates further: \"Just as the separation occurred over millions of years, the Last Judgment [the \"final healing\"] will extend over a similarly long period, and perhaps an even longer one. Its length can, however, be greatly shortened by miracles, the device for shortening but not abolishing time\" (T-2.VIII.2:5-6). In reality, it would be possible to let go of the whole illusion at once, a complete and total collapse of time if you will, if our fear of losing this self we believe to be ourselves were not so great. For it's not simply that \"this whole world/cosmos [will be] truly over and done with\" but so will this self we identify with, or any specific self we may wish to identify with, for that matter. And then, our ego self asks, who would we be? That's why Jesus assures us, \"Fear not that you will be abruptly lifted up and hurled into reality\" (T-16.VI.8:1). I am not sure where you have drawn the conclusion that the Course says we are \"awake in the dream.\" Jesus does say that, \"You are at home in God, dreaming of exile,\" but this is not the same as saying we are awake and dreaming at the same time, for he adds to that thought, \"but perfectly capable of awakening to reality\" (T-10.I.2:1). Repeatedly through the Course, Jesus contrasts the alternative states of dreaming and waking, as in the following passage: \"Could it be some dreams are kept, and others wakened from? The choice is not between which dreams to keep, but only if you want to live in dreams or to awaken from them. Thus it is the miracle does not select some dreams to leave untouched by its beneficence. You cannot dream some dreams and wake from some, for you are either sleeping or awake. And dreaming goes with only one of these\" (T-29.IV.1:4-8; italics added). The Course does say that we cannot change our reality (T-19.II.3) and the Self we truly are continues on, unaffected by our nightmarish dreams (e.g., T-30.III.10; W-pI.190.6; W-pII.6.1). But awakened does not describe our state in Heaven. It is a dualistic term that refers to the state of the final correction in the split mind for the dreaming of the ego, when we recognize it is all a dream (T-17.I.1). Another term Jesus uses to describe the awakened state is the real world, but this is still part of the illusion (e.g., T-26.V.12:3). In the real world, we know that the separation has never happened and that to think that it could happen is only silly. We are still aware of the dream, but we are no longer personally identified with any of the figures within the dream, although others who are still asleep and dreaming may continue to see us as a figure within their dream. There may be an intermediate step, before we awaken, when we become aware that we are dreaming, much like the state of lucid dreaming some people experience at night, when we are still asleep but become aware that we are asleep and dreaming, but choose to continue to sleep and dream. As for your final concern, you have been ensnared in the ego's very deliberate delusion that you are \"the dream character in some dreamer's dream\" (e.g., see T-27.VII.8) rather than the dreamer yourself of the dream (T-27.VII.9). If you keep your identification and focus on the dream symbols, the dream figures, of which the self you think you are is just one, you're right, nothing in the dream can be relied on, for none of it is true, not even Jesus and the Course. But symbols can be used to serve either of only two contrasting purposes, and it is at the level of purpose that we can distinguish between what can and cannot be relied upon. The purpose for the dream is always assigned, not within the dream itself, but in the mind outside the dream. And quite simply, symbols within the dream may be used either for the purpose of keeping us asleep and dreaming by supporting the mind's identification with the dream figures, or for the purpose of awakening by helping the mind disidentify from the dream and its figures (T-28.II.4). Clearly people can and do use Jesus and the Course for both purposes. So we're not being asked to trust or believe Jesus or the Course as figures/symbols within our dream. Our only concern should be whether those symbols are being used in our own mind to maintain our belief that something of value is happening within the dream, so that we remain content with continuing to dream, or are being used to point to a reality beyond the dream that reinforces our desire to awaken. We are the only ones who can make that choice. In the end, we will all awaken, and that outcome is certain, since sleeping and dreaming are only illusions. But we can continue to believe we are asleep and dreaming for as long as we want, with all the sorrowful consequences of a seeming life lived outside of love. Yet, to return to the point we made earlier, we can always choose to shorten the duration of the nightmare through the practice of forgiveness, or the miracle. For further discussion of the nature of the dream and awakening, you may wish to refer to #893."

    "text_input": "Q #1041: My 8-year-old granddaughter has Tourette syndrome. I feel I am in her life to help her, but I'm not sure how. I am new to A Course in Miracles. I know the answer to my quest is in there somewhere! Can you speed up the process for me? How do you help a child with a debilitating disorder overcome her fears when you find it hard enough to face your own? I think she is here to teach as well as to learn. And can you also address the issue of the Indigo Children. Are they real or just another figment of our imagination? A: First and foremost, just be a normal grandmother, doing what loving, caring grandmothers do for their grandchildren. Along with that, the Course can be helpful to you in terms of looking within to the content in your mind--there is nothing in the Course about behavior. You put your finger on the core of the problem by recognizing that you cannot be of genuine help to anyone when you yourself are in a state of fear. If you are afraid for another person, you are seeing that person and yourself as an ego--as a vulnerable, weak, victimized body. That is the temptation practically all of us succumb to, and with good reason, for that is why there is a world in the first",
    "output": "place--so that we would be blinded by form (bodies) and forget all about content (our minds) (T-22.III.6:7). So the first step in your thinking about this is to ask for help to correct your own distorted perception of yourself and your granddaughter. In this sense, she is your teacher, because she is reflecting back to you--through your reactions to her--what is going on in your own mind, the thought system you are using to interpret the situation. Feeling fearful, which is quite normal, is telling you that you are looking at the situation through your ego's eyes. This course is teaching you that fear is a choice, and that you can make a different choice: to see through Jesus' eyes, or the Holy Spirit's. So to begin with, you just want to acknowledge that you are following the ego's interpretation of the situation-- that this is a tragedy and that your granddaughter is an innocent victim. Again, these are normal perceptions in this world. When you switch to Jesus as your inner teacher, you will begin to realize that you can be peaceful in the face of what appears to be sad misfortune. Most people find this terribly difficult to accept, because--having identified with the ego thought system--we instinctively feel that inner peace is dependent on external circumstances. That is totally false. It is the big lie of the ego that what God created can be changed. Jesus repeats in different ways throughout the Course the essential thought that \"I am as God created me. His Son can suffer nothing. And I am His Son ... You are as God created you, and so is every living thing you look upon, regardless of the images you see\" (T-31.VIII.5:2-4; 6:1). You can thus use this situation in your life as a means of learning this for yourself, and in so doing, you will be conveying the same sought-for message to all who come into your presence--without ever uttering a word about it. Your peaceful presence will remind them that they, too, can make the same choice. We cannot see our own or anyone else's full Atonement path, so we should be extremely cautious about judging situations as tragic, and people as innocent victims. Although we do not know this, it could be that your granddaughter (as a mind) is using this physical condition as a way of learning that the body is a projection and does not define her. If that is the case, then that is her means of getting beyond her ego and remembering her true Identity; therefore, from that point of view it would not be a tragedy at all. However, this does not mean that you and her family should not pursue medical treatment, etc., but in your mind, you would be seeing the situation from a different perspective. When you can set your fear aside--if just for an instant-- the love in your right mind would flow through you and guide you in what to say or do, which could be nothing, other than being a non-judgmental, peaceful presence. With regard to your question about the Indigo Children who are reported to be enlightened beings that have come to the planet to help us ... This is best thought of in the same context as above--that is, on the level of mind we are all one. Everyone is here to teach and to learn. There may be some extremes on the scale, as reflected in your question, but in truth everyone is here to both teach and learn."

    "text_input": "Q #1042: What exactly is meant by littleness? It is not contained in the glossary of terms. I have an idea but I would really appreciate a confirmation. If the separation never really happened, then why are we still perceived to remain in a separated state?",
    "output": "At one point in the text Jesus says something absolutely startling about us: \"The truth about you is so lofty that nothing unworthy of God is worthy of you\" (T-9.VII.8:4). This same evaluation is echoed in a later statement: \"God is not willing that His Son be content with less than everything. For He is not content without His Son, and His Son cannot be content with less than his Father has given him\" (T-15.III.4:10-11). Littleness, then, is anything not worthy of God, which means that anything of the ego would fall into the category of littleness--any kind of limitation, individuality, fragmentation, or imperfection. Thus, we belittle ourselves and each other when we think of ourselves as bodies--incomplete, needy, conflicted, sick, special, superior/inferior, etc., etc. And when we seek for things in the world, Jesus says, \"Here does the Son of God ask not too much, but far too little. He would sacrifice his own identity with everything, to find a little treasure of his own. And this he cannot do without a sense of isolation, loss and loneliness\" (T-26.VII.11:7-9; see also W-pI.133.3). The entire Course, in a sense, is about helping us realize what we have done to ourselves by preferring an illusory existence of specialness and individuality over our true Identity, eternally at one with God's Love. Never does Jesus say this is sinful and deserving of punishment. It is simply a silly mistake that we should not want to choose to uphold an instant longer. There is no intellectually satisfying answer to your second question--it presupposes the reality of the \"we\" who perceive ourselves in a separated state. This is totally baffling to us, as \"we\" seem quite real, and \"we\" often evaluate situations as \"life threatening\"--implying our lives here are real. Fortunately, the focus of A Course in Miracles is not on getting us to see everything, including ourselves, as illusory. Forgiveness applied to our daily relationships and interactions is its focus: seeing shared, not separate interests, and that nothing has power to take away our peace. Yet, ultimately, the Course's unique understanding of forgiveness can be properly comprehended only within the framework of its metaphysical non-dualism. Jesus assures us, though, that it will all come together for us if we just become more consistent in choosing him as our teacher, rather than the ego. Withdrawing our faith and trust in the ego's version of reality and placing it in his is the one alternative that is always open to us."

I want people to know this about me because I feel it is \"who I am.\" This has become a very big part of my life and I feel that by trying to \"blend in\" and be \"normal\" I am not being true to myself. Can you please comment on this? A: This is an issue many students have raised over the years in many different ways. While it probably is true that others will not understand the Course and why you chose it as your path, this need not be something fearful to you. You did not mention specifically what you are afraid of should they not understand, but in some cases people have feared being rejected for believing in a thought system that is not reconcilable with traditional biblical religions. That has happened to many students, but they were able to deal with it. What will help you a great deal is to keep form and content distinct. On the level of content, to say that A Course in Miracles has become a big part of your life means that you have chosen",
    "output": "Jesus or the Holy Spirit as your inner Teacher, and are now dedicated to seeing everything in your life as a classroom in which you will learn that your interests are not separate from anyone else's. Your life now has this as its purpose (content), having relinquished the ego's purpose of seeing everything in the context of its principles of one or the other and kill or be killed. Being true to yourself thus means living this way, and forgiving yourself when you discover you have reverted to the ego's way--of judgments, differences, specialness, victims and victimizers, etc. You are being true to yourself by recognizing separating thoughts and actions, and then not judging yourself for them. There is no need, really, to explicitly let others know that you are approaching your life differently now. It doesn't matter if they know or not, for your focus would still be on the thoughts in your mind about yourself and others--wrong-minded or right-minded. In a sense, this will keep you more honest with yourself. You will not feel that you are hiding anything from anyone or sacrificing something of yourself. If spiritual paths come up in a conversation, or others see you with \"the book,\" then you would just talk about its meaningfulness to you, without any investment in their responses. Again, if your focus is always on bringing your wrong-minded thoughts to the loving presence of Jesus in your mind, then you would not be focusing on bringing \"the book\" to others. The love of Jesus is in their right minds, just as it is in yours; and they have the power to choose it, just as you do. If that is the content in your mind, then you are being true to yourself as a student of this course. That is where your passion and excitement should be directed--the joy of seeing yourself and others as Jesus does. When you are thus centered in loving content, you will have less and less sense of a separate self that needs to communicate as one self to another self. The love in your mind will naturally extend itself through you in whatever form is helpful at that time in those circumstances."

I believe that Jesus would never speak for such things.",
    "output": "It is important to know the context of Helen's comment in order to understand it properly. On the same page you cite in Absence from Felicity, Kenneth states that Helen was keenly aware of her inner conflict--between \"Heaven and Helen,\" as she described it. Within this framework, \"Jesus' will and her own were always separate,\" and therefore she would be aware of what was coming from her--meaning the part of her that was terrified of accepting his love--and what was coming from that loving presence she knew to be Jesus. She was aware that she was resisting the emotional acceptance of what she had accepted intellectually from Jesus. \"Helen did believe in the truth of the Course's teachings, not to mention in the existence of its author. However, she was not able emotionally to accept its truth into her own personal life\" (p. 156). This is a crucial distinction. She knew that she would be better off doing what Jesus asked of her; she was just afraid of the consequences of accepting his will unconditionally at all times. Jesus was not speaking against her peace, as you have interpreted her comment to mean. Quite the opposite--she knew she would be better off if she integrated into her daily life what she knew to be the truth intellectually. Kenneth concludes that this integration came \"all at once at the moment of her death\" (p. 157; see also Chapter 18 where Kenneth describes her final days and death). Every student of A Course in Miracles is bound to run into this same dilemma. We all have minds split between wanting Jesus to be the central figure in our journey, and a fierce resistance to letting go of the self we think is our identity but which is a false self determined to keep the true Jesus as far away as possible. This intense fear will inevitably cause us to have a distorted experience of his love. That is why he emphasizes so much the need to become aware of these two parts of our minds. It is vital to our progress with the Course to come to know and respect our fear of the truth about us, so that we will not erect even further defenses against it, thus burying it deeper and deeper in our minds. This is what Jesus wants to help us with more than anything, if we will let him. If we do let him, we will be more peaceful, more often, as together we walk the pathway home."

It opens me up to all kinds of self-hatred--\"I should have had different thoughts than I have.\" And a second question: when pain is here, I should not relate to them with love and mercy and care, because that would make them real to me? Please help me out here!",
    "output": "Your confusion and fear are common among students of A Course in Miracles because we want to read its words from the perspective of the self we think we are--a vulnerable body, with its own specific personality and personal history, that makes choices affecting the quality of its life here in this world of time and space (T-27.VIII). But when we read it this way, the Course's words can be turned into a tool of the ego, reinforcing rather than undoing guilt. And so long as we do, we will not understand what the Course means by sickness, why there is no hierarchy among illusions, including physical illnesses, what is the real cause of all our suffering and pain, where the suffering and pain is actually experienced, or just who it is that is responsible for choosing what seems to happen to the body, including illnesses. Identified with our body, we come to the Course with a variety of intentions to make our lives here better, perhaps improving and maintaining our health and avoiding or at least minimizing future sickness and disease and decline, resolving our financial concerns, and healing our relationships with our families, lovers and friends so that we may be happier in the world. And some of these things may in fact occur in our lives as we begin to practice the Course at whatever level we understand its message of forgiveness. But Jesus and his Course are not concerned with the world, our lives and our bodies, or the relationship of our bodies to other bodies. Jesus is only concerned with our minds and the thoughts that they are holding, and which teacher we are inviting to look with us at those thoughts. From his perspective, sickness, as well as death, is nothing more than a thought of separation and guilt in the mind that has nothing to do with the body (M-5.II.3). With the ego as our teacher, we will attempt to hide the guilt from ourselves, disguising it by projecting it onto a made-up world as either sickness within our body or conflict with other bodies, either of which then seems to be the cause of our suffering and pain. But the pain and suffering, just like the thought of guilt, remains in the mind that continues to identify with the ego--that, again, is the only sickness (T-28.II.11:7). And so from the ego's perspective the specific bodily problem and its severity do not really matter--it can even be simply the fear of a future malady-- so long as the focus remains, not in the mind where the only real healing can happen, but outside the mind on the body and the world, where no meaningful change can be effected. So long as we continue to identify with the body and take its needs seriously, we are sick. Not because there is anything bad or sinful about the body, but only because we obviously are still needing a defense against the thought of guilt and separation in the mind, or we would know we are a mind and not a body. As we begin to make the shift in identification to the mind, with the Holy Spirit or Jesus as our teacher--a process which for most of us will be gradual--we will become increasingly less concerned with what specifically is happening with our body and more focused on how we can use whatever seems to be happening as a means for getting back in touch with the underlying thought in the mind that is behind the projection. To feel guilty about anything that seems to be happening to the body simply means that we have once again turned away from the Holy Spirit and are looking to the ego for guidance (T-13.X.6). And that may not be very smart, but it's likely to happen and certainly is nothing to feel guilty about. Now it will be much more helpful to notice any concern you have right now with any current problem with your body and to recognize it as a classroom for looking at the buried guilt right now, than to be concerned about an imagined and imaginary state of your body at some point in the future near the end of your life. For the more you are able to practice the Course's principles in the present, the less fear you will have about what may seem to happen to your body in the future. And if your goal increasingly becomes, not to have a healthy body, but to have a healed mind, you will be able to rest in the assurance that you are okay no matter what seems to be happening to the body. Such peace of mind may seem still to be off somewhere in the distant future, but the steps to make it a reality are available to all of us now. As for your second question, the issue is not whether to relate to our pain and suffering with mercy and love and care, but rather whether we can relate to ourselves with mercy and love and care for foolishly having chosen pain and suffering. Please understand that once you are experiencing pain, you have already made that pain real. So to decide at that point that you will avoid looking at it and addressing it out of fear of making it real is simply a form of denial that serves no helpful purpose. And remember, our pain and suffering has nothing to do with what's happening to our body and everything to do with the teacher of separation and guilt and fear that we have chosen in our mind. Jesus would never judge or condemn us for making the wrong choice, so why should we? It's only the ego that condemns us for choosing the ego, because nothing better serves its purpose than convincing us that the ego needs to be taken seriously. Jesus' teaching is much gentler and so we would be wise to ask for his help in learning how to be gentle with ourselves."

    "output": "This idea of transcending the body is the subject of \"Beyond the Body\" in Chapter 18 of the text (T-18.VI). There Jesus speaks about it as the experience of \"escape from limitations ... a joining of yourself and something else in which your mind enlarges to encompass it ... What really happens is that you have given up the illusion of a limited awareness, and lost your fear of union ... You have accepted this instead of the body, and have let yourself be one with something beyond it, simply by not letting yourself be limited by it\" (T-18.VI.11:3-4,7,11). The Course's process of getting us back to our natural state as spirit beyond the body (W- pI.72.9:3) involves reversing the steps we took to \"become\" bodies. As the above passages indicate, Jesus is telling us that because we have such a fear of union (oneness), we cling to our perception of limitations in ourselves and others; and it is the body that serves this purpose of limiting our awareness. We can never know love as it truly is or ourselves as we truly are as long as we are convinced of the reality of the body: \"The body is a limit on love. The belief in limited love was its origin, and it was made to limit the unlimited ... it was made to limit you\" (T- 18.VIII.1:2-4). But the way to reverse this, Jesus is teaching us, is to focus on the purpose of what we do with our bodies, rather than to try to talk ourselves into believing we are not bodies. Your insistence on experiencing yourself without a body could well be an ego setup--a way of making the error real. In other words, you would not be making this into a condition of accepting the Course as true unless you were not already convinced that you are a body. So if we use the body to keep ourselves separate from others--through specialness, comparisons, competition, judgment, etc.--then we will always be limited by it and bound to it, for that is the secret wish behind our perception of separate interests. On the other hand, we can change that purpose by asking Jesus or the Holy Spirit to help us see that our interests are the same as everyone else's. That would be to affirm our underlying will to regain awareness of our true state of oneness: God's Son is one. The Course's means of having us get beyond the body is first to train us to think in terms of the purpose for which we use the body, and then, having chosen Jesus or the Holy Spirit as our Teacher instead of the ego, use the body for the purpose of dissolving the separation we thought existed between ourselves and everyone else--this is always a matter of our mind's perception, not behavior. Again, this is accomplished through the recognition that our interests are the same, regardless of the different forms our lives take. As our perceptions of separation gradually change to true perception of our oneness, then the importance of the body starts to fade. Our awareness of the body as our real identity, thus, is entirely dependent on the choice we make in our minds to see separation as real or unreal. If we choose to minimize in importance the differences among us, the body's importance to us will likewise diminish, for our awareness will be flooded more and more with what joins us. The body's reality in our awareness disappears to the extent to which our \"fear of union\" disappears. That is why the process of A Course in Miracles focuses so intently on undoing our perception that we are separate from one another. This process--forgiveness--does not focus on having us transcend the body through meditation or some other means, as do other spiritual paths; it has us focus on the cause of our thinking we are bodies in the first place, which is to maintain our existence as separate, special individuals. Again, that is not our natural state (W-pI.72.9:3). The \"proof\" of immortality that you are seeking will occur in these experiences of the holy instant and in true perception, where you realize that the boundaries that seem to separate you from others are totally false. This experience can be sustained for long periods of time, and indeed is the natural outcome of the practice of forgiveness. The sense of invulnerability that is our natural state as God's Son will be restored in this way. But to have no awareness of the body at all is not the goal of our practice; it would be impossible to stay here without some awareness of the body. The difference would be that as your mind is healed, you would know for certain that you are not your body, and therefore that nothing in this world can affect the inner peace that is the permanent content of your mind."

    "text_input": "Q #1047: Did the Jewish People have a \"collective consciousness\" experience of God at Mount Sinai when they received the Torah? Or were they tapping into some illusory transmission of a set of rules to guide societal living, perhaps even a \"close encounter,\" so it could have been a very real feeling experience but not one of God if \"He\" has nothing to do with our dream of separation? And if any group relates to the idea of separation/good/evil it is certainly the Jewish People! It just bothers me, as a 10-year convert to Judaism and as a new student to A Course in Miracles, that as long as one insists on the existence of \"good\" in the world, it continually recreates its opposite of \"bad,\" so one can be \"right\" about others being \"wrong.\" And yet God IS good, light, and love, correct? A: It can be fun to speculate on what the source may be for ideas and teachings that seem to allow mankind, or parts of mankind, to take steps forward in its thinking and understanding of where it has come from and where it is heading. But at this level of explanation, we can not go much beyond speculation. However, from the perspective of mind, as the Course describes it, there can be only two possible sources for all ideas that appear within the world's dream--either the right mind or the wrong mind. And regardless of the source, there are also only two choices for how those ideas can then be used and justified in the world--either to reinforce or to undo the belief in separation and guilt. The Torah, like nearly all of the world's spiritual teachings, no doubt drew some of its inspiration from the right-mind, translated into symbols that were especially meaningful to the specific time and place into which it was received, at a level at which it could be understood. Read symbolically, despite a theology very different from the Course's, the Torah can lead the individual to look beyond himself to Something that transcends his limited existence. But as its teachings over time became the foundation for codifications and rituals, it fell into the same spirit-denying strictures that have bedeviled nearly all of the world's formal religions, elevating form above content to justify a belief in differences, specialness, and separation. There is no reason, by the way, to believe that the Course should be immune to such a fate, and it is not difficult to see how this is already happening with its teachings. Never underestimate the power of the ego to use all duality-based symbols for its own duplicitous purposes--self- preservation after all is its only motivation. And that, as you point out, is the problem for any spiritual teaching that keeps its focus on the world and getting things right here. Once that is the premise and the purpose, there is no way to avoid the trap of opposites, and the ego's continued existence has been assured. That is why the Course, in contrast to nearly every other spiritual teaching, insists so uncompromisingly that God has nothing to do with the world (e.g., T- 8.VI.2,3; T-11.III.3; T-11.VII.1,2; T-12.III.9; T-16.V.3:6), for the Love that He is has no",

    "text_input": "Q #1048: Coming into contact with A Course in Miracles over 20 years ago, a doubt bothered me early on: did Helen and Bill make this up? like a project/experiment, all with good intentions. Helen's influences like Freud, Plato, Shakespeare and the Bible seems like someone could make this up. I know it was just my fear of having the answer to my personal hell (the Course) not be true. Am I the only one with such doubts?",
    "output": "There are very few people who have not experienced some doubts along these lines. Jesus probably had you in mind when in the Epilogue at the end of the clarification of terms he says that doubts--and even despair--will arise, but not to fret, because the ending is guaranteed: \"Forget not once this journey is begun the end is certain. Doubt along the way will come and go and go to come again. Yet is the ending sure. No one can fail to do what God appointed him to do. When you forget, remember that you walk with Him and with His Word upon your Heart. Who could despair when hope like this is his? Illusions of despair may seem to come, but learn how not to be deceived by them. Behind each one there is reality and there is God ... The end is sure and guaranteed by God\" (C-ep.1:1-10). More than likely, your doubts are linked precisely to what you suspect: your fear that this way out of hell is not valid. In line with what Jesus says in \"The Fear of Redemption\" section, however, it would probably be more accurate to say that your fear is that the Course is valid, and that it will work (T-13.III). As egos, the last thing we truly want is to be free of our egos! And therefore we will seize on anything at all that would justify our remaining in an ego state, even at the cost of our peace of mind. Insane? Yes! But that is exactly why we need to learn to trust a teacher who is not caught in the same thought system as we are. \"Trust\" is the very first characteristic that Jesus cites in the manual for teachers as a mark of an advanced teacher of God, and then he goes on to discuss the various stages that one goes through in the process of learning to trust (M-4.I). Just accept your doubting as normal, and as a stage that most students go through as they begin to take Jesus' message seriously and decide to put it into practice. Our resistance to seeing this process through to the end is far stronger than we ever imagined, which makes patience and gentleness, along with trust, essential for any student on this path of thought-reversal. As you begin to experience hope and peace, your assurance that this is the right path for you will increase, and your doubts will lessen, or you will be guided to another path. Jesus himself tells us that we don't have to believe his ideas, or accept or even welcome them: \"You are asked only to use them. It is their use that will give them meaning to you, and will show you that they are true\" (W-in.8:5-6). How can we not trust in such a teacher, who has such trust in us! In the end, what difference would it make if the Course did come from Helen and Bill? Only its ideas--what it says --are important. The material stands on its own. This is what Jesus means when he tells us that it is only his message, not him, that will help us, although he would love to have us accept his love in a very personal way in our lives (C-5.6)."

I don't understand why the world was referred to as \"Your world.\" We made the world which needs forgiveness. The \"world\" the Father created is Heaven and doesn't need forgiveness. So why would we need to forgive \"Your world\"? I would have understood it if it had read \"our world.\" There's just something here that's confusing me.",
    "output": "You are correct, the Father's world is Heaven, which of itself does not need forgiveness. We need to forgive Heaven/God's world because we have projected responsibility for the separation onto it, and thereby onto God. In an effort to escape responsibility for the mind's choice to be separate, the ego tells us God banished us from Heaven as punishment for taking the thought of separation seriously. We forgive God's world by accepting that the decision to be separate is a choice in the mind, about which God knows nothing. His changeless world remains unaffected by the choice, as Jesus tells us: \"not one note in Heaven's song was missed\" (T-26.V.5:4). The need to forgive Heaven arises when the mind that would believe that the separation did indeed occur, and has had devastating effects, takes offense at the changelessness of Heaven, and the immutability of God's Love. In the mind's choice for separation, God, His Love, and His world are perceived as threatening because in Them all specialness vanishes. Directed to the mind, rather than to God Who does not hear prayers, the beautiful prayers in the second half of the workbook are poetic, meditative ways of restating the principles taught previously in the workbook. Like the single voice with which the Son sings to the Father, and He to the Son (S-1.in.1), the prayers are expressions of the mind reflecting back to itself its willingness to live the ideas contained in the prayer. In this case, we remind ourselves that we want to remember Heaven, releasing it of the judgments projected onto it by the guilt-ridden mind. Our desire is to remember that Heaven did not abandon us; we abandoned Heaven by our choice. Just as it was forgotten it can be remembered, and thus it is forgiven."

    "text_input": "Q #1050: After reading fully the text of A Course in Miracles and committing myself to the students' program for a year, I find myself in a position of \"belief,\" but want to go to the level of \"knowledge.\" I ask for something to show me that I am on the right path, that I am going in the right direction. I have looked at the various aspects of my life, be it career, creative projects, or relationships, and all things seem at a standstill. I let go and give the future to God to lead me ... and nothing happens ... I have worked through being anxious about the future and ask that what I feel inside be reflected on the outside somehow, but, there does not seem to be congruency. I want so much to have my beliefs validated because I don't want to believe that God would withhold happiness and fulfillment from one of his Sons who wants so much to be joined with Him. A: In the simplicity of its message, the Course offers only one path for its students: the practice of forgiveness. This will lead to knowledge, which lies beyond forgiveness and beyond any path. The one-year study program of the workbook is only the beginning of a lifetime of practice: \"This course is a beginning, not an end\" (W-ep.1:1). So, although the Course is a \"fast track,\" the process of applying its teachings to our lives is a slow road that requires patience and practice. The process is slow only because resistance is great, and attachment to the ego's belief system is deeper than we think. That is why Jesus repeats his message in many different ways throughout the Course.",
    "output": "What seems to be a lack of congruency in your process, therefore, is only evidence of the inevitable resistance. This is no cause for distress. Jesus acknowledges our resistance and recommends that we proceed gently and patiently. He assures us that God is not withholding anything from His Son. Nothing is missing in the equation of oneness; rather, something has been added that blocks awareness of the oneness: the decision to be a separate self. The mind's choice to believe in separation is the only thing that keeps knowledge of our oneness with God from awareness. Thus, the way to return to knowledge and love, is to accept the mind's healing of the thought of separation through forgiveness. That is all we are asked to do. Jesus tells us the plan will not fail because its success lies in the power of the mind that chose separation, and can choose differently: \"God's guarantee will hold against all obstacles, for it rests on certainty and not contingency. It rests on you\" (T-20.IV.8:10-11). To further lighten our burden, we are not asked to evaluate our progress. In fact, Jesus tells us: \"Put yourself not in charge of this, for you cannot distinguish between advance and retreat. Some of your greatest advances you have judged as failures, and some of your deepest retreats you have evaluated as success\" (T-18.V.1:5-6). Clearly, then, we are most gentle with ourselves if we agree to proceed calmly in the simple, though not easy, practice of forgiveness. Diligence in this practice is what will make the inner and outer more congruent, as every relationship and experience in daily life become opportunities to apply the principles of the Course's teaching, thereby unifying their purpose in service of a single goal. Having found the right path and a curriculum that guarantees results, the only thing to do is stay with the program. The pace of the learning process is commensurate with willingness to look at the ego's arsenal of resistance techniques without judging them. Jesus offers encouraging words to every student of his Course: \"If the way seems long, let him be content. He has decided on the direction he wants to take. What more was asked of him? And having done what was required, would God withhold the rest?\" (M-22.2:6-9)."

    "text_input": "Q #1051: I suppose I do not get it, i.e., that consciousness came into being after the separation. Would not consciousness have been born before the separation? Because if there were a fusion of Cause and Effect or Creator and creations there would not have been an awareness of distinction that could precipitate a separation. The conscious Son was tempted by the ego- maniacal idea that it should resent being just a mere creation and not be grateful to the Creator. The ego told the Son that it would always be second best. Thus was born the separation. We now have the real world of God and His only Son. We also have an unreal world, the only world we know and the fact that it is called unreal does not seem to make any difference. Like I said, I guess I just don't get it. A: Consciousness could not be part of perfect Oneness because consciousness implies duality: subject and object. In a sense you are asking a version of the most commonly asked question-- how could this have happened?--and there really is no fully satisfying answer. The problem is that your question itself arises from a mind that believes the separation happened, otherwise there would be no question. Jesus thus says in A Course in Miracles:",
    "output": "\"The ego will demand many answers this course does not give. It does not recognize as questions the mere form of a question to which an answer is impossible. The ego may ask, 'How did the impossible occur?', 'To what did the impossible happen?', and may ask this in many forms. Yet there is no answer; only an experience. Seek only this, and do not let theology delay you\" (C- in.4; see also T-4.II.1:1). In this same place Jesus explains that his course \"remains within the ego framework, where it is needed. It is not concerned with what is beyond all error because it is planned only to set the direction towards it. Therefore it uses words, which are symbolic, and cannot express what lies beyond symbols\" (C-in.3:1-3). Jesus must use language we can understand, otherwise there would be no communication at all; and the language we understand is the language of duality-- real distinctions, separate beings, consciousness of things, etc., as well as the language and concepts of the Judaeo-Christian tradition. But as he says here, as well as in other places (see especially T-25.I), he regards words as symbols that point us to something that cannot be expressed in words or any other kind of symbol. He therefore asks humility of us, and not to rely on our own understanding as a measure of the truth of what he says (T-18.IV.7:4-6). We cannot rely on our own thinking because of our concealed commitment to uphold the ego thought system rather than the truth held for us in our right minds by the Holy Spirit. Our understanding is prone to distortion because of what we have hidden from the light of truth. That is why Jesus says, \"Do not let theology delay you\"--for centuries we have argued and fought over which theological systems are valid and which are not. So he is advising us to seek only the experience that is the outcome of our practice of forgiveness--that God loves all people without exception, and that we never lost the innocence in which He created us. All questions and doubts will simply vanish then."

I experience such joy, wonder, and appreciation of what I have always perceived to be God's creation! What now if He didn't create all this--the beauty of nature, etc., and none of it is \"real\"? I will be very disappointed.",
    "output": "You have understood the Course's explanation for the physical universe correctly. God did not make the world, it is a miscreation of the mind that brought it into awareness by projecting on to it the guilt for having chosen to believe in the separation. This insight is not only disappointing, but a shock for everyone who has held traditional beliefs in God, and it is usually not the only shock in studying the Course. The ego has done a very good job of teaching its thought system, which includes a God who made the world, put us in it, and takes us out whenever He chooses. One of the important goals of the Course is exposing the secrets and hidden lies of this thought system. One such secret is the mind's wish that there be a world to replace the home that seemed to have been lost when separation was chosen. Although the world has great physical beauty, Jesus explains its origin and purpose as established by the ego: \"The world was made as an attack on God. It symbolizes fear. And what is fear except love's absence? Thus the world was meant to be a place where God could enter not, and where His Son could be apart from Him\" (W-pII.2:1-4). Uncovering the ego's scheme involves questioning long-held values that support belief in the reality of the body and the world. Since the thought of separation is not true, it requires heavy defenses to maintain belief in it. One of the convincing arguments in favor of belief in the world is its physical beauty. However, its beauty does not beautify the mind's decision to use it to defend separation. This information may be experienced as disappointing or worse, but a closer look reveals the ego's thought system at work in a world that offers much suffering and devastation along with its beauty. If God made one, He must have made the other, which makes Him a cruel Creator indeed, and that is precisely what the ego would have us believe. It feeds our fear that what God gave He can snatch away in an instant without warning. This thought covers an even deeper secret; i.e., that what the world offers was not really given to us by God but was stolen from Him, and He will \"appear\" suddenly and take it all back. The source of this belief is the mind's guilt for having usurped God's creative power by deciding to identify with the ego (and thereby with the body), instead of accepting the Identity God bestowed upon us as His one Son. In this choice for the ego the mind \"steals\" authorship of itself, believing it is the father, not the son. This is one example of what the Course refers to as the reversal of cause and effect. The ego was made out of the wish of God's Son to father himself: \"The ego, then, is nothing more than a delusional system in which you made your own father. Make no mistake about this. It sounds insane when it is stated with perfect honesty, but the ego never looks on what it does with perfect honesty. Yet that is its insane premise, which is carefully hidden in the dark cornerstone of its thought system. And either the ego, which you made, is your father, or its whole thought system will not stand\" (T-11.in.2:4-8). With the ego as father, the Son now identifies with the body and is in need of a home. The mind then brings the world into awareness to serve as the home of the father/ego and his son/body. The problem is, as Jesus tells us in the text, \"You do not really want the world you see, for it has disappointed you since time began\" (T-13.VII.31). That is not to say that you cannot enjoy the beauty you find in the world any less than other pleasurable things of the body, such as music or art. Though born to serve the ego, the world can become the means to undo belief in the ego. It can serve the Holy Spirit's purpose, which begins with the recognition that the world came into being with the mind's belief that separation is not only possible, but has been accomplished and has had real effects. Your surprise is an indication that this new perspective has already occurred to you. From here the important thing is to proceed gently in the process of exchanging the ego's thought system for the Holy Spirit's. Learning to see the beauties of nature differently does not mean not enjoying them. When you choose the Holy Spirit as your Teacher, the world becomes a classroom that has a beauty all its own by giving us a place wherein to apply the teachings of His curriculum. Then, whether the world shows its beautiful side or the devastation effects of nature (e.g. Katrina), the Holy Spirit's lessons can be applied equally. Thus, for the ego, both the beauty and the devastation of the world serve to make it real. For the Holy Spirit, neither the beauty nor the devastation can serve to detract from the peace of God, nor impede progress on the path to the beauty of our true home. See Questions #70 and #121."

It seems that we are on a journey with multiple steps only because our fear of awakening is so great. We therefore proceed gently, \"step by step\" through the healing process.

Since we think in terms of linear time, and believe that the separation has been accomplished, we perceive the need for a gradual process of undoing. Our only concern is the steps of forgiveness we are asked to take. We don't even have to refrain from the last step. It is a given, once the blocks of resistance are removed. In the end, we will awaken from the dream of separation and remember the first and only step that God took in creating His Son.

    "text_input": "Q #1054: Over the years I've had an experience from time to time while sleeping, where my mind wakes up and I feel I'm in an astral plane racing up to higher levels. It feels very real and I feel cool air and my mind feels very electric, like I've left my body. I get a little fearful and try to pull myself back and wake up my body. This has shown me that there are much deeper levels in my mind that I normally wouldn't experience in my everyday life. It seems like I really fear letting go of my body and the world when I have this experience. Now I see why no matter what good intentions I have for letting go of my ego and being at peace, I'm so entrenched in my ego/body identity. For 40 years it's a chipping away process, little by little, because of the deep rooted fear/guilt I don't even notice on the surface. Is this why we rarely experience the deeper levels of our mind because of the massive block of guilt and fear? A: Yes, the guilt experienced by the mind for choosing against itself, and thereby against God, is very deep. It has been covered over by layers of denial spurned by fear of God's punishment. Experiences that indicate we are not physical bodies, such as the one you describe, often evoke feelings of fear that reflect the mind's fear of recognizing its identity as mind. Your insight into the fear of losing the body's identity is very helpful. It explains why it is so difficult to understand the Course, regardless of Jesus' assurance that it is very simple (T-11.VIII.1:1). Though it is difficult, practicing it and applying its teachings to our lives is much more so, due to our tremendous resistance to letting go of the ego's thought system. The process begins with the recognition of resistance by an honest admission of how firmly we hold on to the ego. Seeing the blocks of resistance makes the need for setting a gentle pace in the undoing process obvious. It also accomplishes one of the most important steps in learning the Holy Spirit's curriculum: \"Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all of the barriers within yourself that you have built against it\" (T-16.IV.6:1). In the manual, Jesus refers to resistance in a way that applies to your experience. He tells us that resistance to healing is \"enormous\" because it requires the acceptance that our experience of the world is the result of a choice in the mind (see M-5.II.1). This returns responsibility for it to the mind, and in the process undoes all belief in the decision-making power of the body. The ego has taught us (and we have learned the lesson well) that the body makes decisions and \"rules\" the world. This belief makes both the body and the world real in our experience. Clinging to this belief we resist Jesus' teaching in order to protect the world and the body, and to maintain the thought of separation. An experience of the astral body, although still within the realm of the ego, may serve as a reminder to the mind that it cannot be contained in a body. Indeed, it does not belong to the body at all, neither astral nor physical. Therein lies the threat to the body's \"existence\" that evokes fear in the form of resistance calling to mind Jesus' words of caution: \"Trust not your good intentions. They are not enough\" (T-18.IV.2:1-2). A healthy respect for the intensity of",
    "output": "attachment to the body sets a firm foundation for proceeding with patience and gentleness through the learning process. It helps dispel the fantasy of instant success and keeps the mind calmly focused on the path of forgiveness. Your insight into the depths of the searing guilt that permeates the dream of separation is therefore of great value. Neither the guilt nor the resistance will prevail. Acknowledging them can only save time by not wasting it on escapades into deeper forays of denial. We are not asked not to have the blocks of resistance, but countless times we are asked to look in order to find them. In few words Jesus puts the simple task before us: \"Be vigilant ... \" (T-6.V-C). And when you find the blocks it will not be the ego that has led you."

Is the \"communion with God\" the Course speaks of not also an illusion in that it implies one (separated) aspect of God is talking to another separated aspect?",
    "output": "This \"question\" always pertains to content, not form. Thus, it would always be about our accepting the Atonement, or some variant of that. As an example, Jesus twice pleads with us: \"Why wait for Heaven?\" (W-pI.131.6:1; W-pI.188.1:1); and again in the workbook he tells us that we should ask \"a thousand times a day,\" \"'Who walks with me?'\" (W-pI.156.8:1-2). Then, in the lovely prose poem \"The Gifts of God,\" Jesus directs our thoughts to the gifts we can give to God. In one of many beautifully moving pleas to us, he exclaims, \"Child of Eternal Love, what gift is there your Father wants of you except yourself? And what is there that you would rather give, for what is there that you would rather have? ... What trifling gifts made out of sickly fear and evil dreams of suffering and death can be the substitute you really want for the rememberance of Christ in You?\" (The Gifts of God, p.125) Since imploring God's help with our world and our lives has been the focal point of prayer in practically all religions, East and West, Jesus uses that form in his process of correcting our thinking about who we are and Who God is. But he obviously does not think real communication with God occurs in the dream; it can't. This becomes clear as you comprehend the thought system of A Course in Miracles in its fullness. We are really praying to ourselves to recognize, first, our unquestioned commitment to the ego, and then to turn to the memory of truth in our right minds--symbolized by Jesus and the Holy Spirit--for help in seeing our mistake, so that we may make the choice to end our self-imposed exile from Love, now that we realize that that is what we have done. As our minds are healed of all thoughts of separation from God and from each other, we simply become Love, once again, God's gift to us in our creation"

    "text_input": "Q #1057: Lately I've become aware that I hold a lot of resentment against white people. I even think it may have past life roots! Every time I think I can be at peace or stop judging what I see  as gross insensitivity or outright hostility, things occur that bring me right back to square one. When I ask Jesus about it, all that seems to come to mind is the idea that I shouldn't judge, yet neither should I be blissfully ignorant of these behaviors. Then I get \"mad\" because it's like watching a persistent re-offender with no judicial recourse! Believe it or not, I'd finally like to heal this. Any ideas?",
    "output": "One last piece you can add to the excellent ideas you already have--don't judge and don't deny--is to become aware of the cost of judging, a prominent theme in A Course in Miracles. When you are being judgmental, you may have the temporary good feeling of being right and being the innocent one; but you would not be truly peaceful. The ego's peace never lasts, which tells you it is not the peace of God. You therefore can remind yourself when you are tempted to judge, or even after you have engaged in a massacre of judgment, that you are choosing to divest yourself of God's gift of eternal peace by seeing others as sinful. There is no doubt that people do and say very hateful things, but why must that evoke a response of condemnation and anger? That could happen only if you had already made the decision to throw away the peace that is your natural inheritance; and you would do that only if you valued something else more. If you saw this process clearly, you would have to ask yourself what means more to you than being as God created you. The answers could be enlightening--but they would always have something to do with wanting to preserve your individuality and, through projection, getting rid of the sense of sin and guilt associated with it. This approach would be more beneficial than just getting mad at yourself for being a repeat offender, because getting mad at yourself is itself a judgment, and as you are aware, you cannot get past judgment by judging. So you need to simply watch yourself succumbing to the same temptation, and then, instead of getting mad at yourself, just acknowledge that this is costing you the peace of God; and that you are willing to pay that price in order to be right and to denounce the \"evil ones.\" Separating yourself from others that way leads only to guilt and misery, never peace. But that makes you only a mistaken Son of God, not a sinful one. Hate is a call for love-- everyone's call."

Can you expand on this? I think the person who wrote this is talking about a realm of existence, but he is not talking about God's formless Love.",
    "output": "This view is different from what A Course in Miracles says of God and Heaven. Heaven is \"an awareness of perfect Oneness\" according to the Course (T-18.VI.1). Nothing other than this perfect Oneness exists; anything else is totally illusory. If anything could \"fall\" from this state to another state, there would be something besides perfect Oneness. This is what is known in the Course as the Atonement principle--that separating from God is impossible and therefore never happened in reality."

    "text_input": "Q #1059: Because of sexual abuse from several men, I have all my life experienced demonic \"entities\" in dreams, and also as a \"presence\" now and then as \"awake.\" They have a specific energetic radiation: the absence of love and good. Aware that I have to deal with this and not flee, I have used many ways to \"combat\" them. When I know they are not real, when I \"see\" them, they transform or disappear; but there are times when their appearance is so terrifying that  the fear is stronger than my clarity of mind, and I just \"run.\" This terror from childhood seems to have become symbiotic with my ego-identity. I would like to know if the Course has any suggestions as to how these beings still are in my consciousness when I already have succeeded in \"melting them\" in the light of reality?",
    "output": "Entities such as the ones you describe are different aspects of the ego, and therefore can be let go of as you would any other aspect of the ego: through forgiveness. Forgiveness, in theory, means that we are forgiving an illusion of separation--one form of illusion is not harder to let go of than any other. The practice of this principle, however, must be directed to the level of our experience at any given point in our lives. In terms of our experience, in other words, some aspects of the ego dominate our thinking so intensely that it is necessary to turn to external sources of help that could get us to the level where we can then apply the principles of A Course in Miracles more meaningfully and effectively. This is most often the case when there have been years of fear and terror from abuse, whatever the form. We need to be able to accept help at the level at which we need it; otherwise it will not be truly helpful. Early in the text Jesus teaches us about this important part of our process: \"The value of the Atonement does not lie in the manner in which it is expressed. In fact, if it is used truly, it will inevitably expressed in whatever way is most helpful to the receiver. This means that a miracle, to attain its full efficacy, must be expressed in a language that the recipient can understand without fear ... The whole aim of the miracle is to raise the level of communication, not to lower it by increasing fear\" (T-2.IV.5:1-3,6). So just be sure that you are not skipping this crucial step in you work with the Course. The ultimate lesson is that we can be at peace, regardless of what the world may have done to us. We need only remember that the world has no power over the mind; the dream no power over the dreamer--as we learn in this passage: \"For you would not react at all to figures in a dream you knew that you were dreaming. Let them be as hateful and vicious as they may, they could have no effect on you unless you failed to recognize it is your dream\" (T-27.VIII.10:5-6)."

    "text_input": "Q #1060: Is it possible that once the \"tiny, mad idea\" of separation from God entered the mind of spirit, it produced an illusory Big Bang that we think led to the formation of the phenomenal universe with time and space as coordinates? In this way, the ego could \"explain\" the origins of the universe and therefore perpetuate the notion of separation. Is it also possible that a portion of the Sonship never entertained the idea of separation, never participated in the dream, and is able to maintain continuity of oneness with God despite the fact that another part of the Sonship is dreaming? A: We always need to keep in mind when we engage in speculation that there never was, nor could be, any separation from God. That is the principle of the Atonement--separation from God is impossible. But in the context of the myth of separation and its undoing presented in A Course in Miracles, the Big Bang could be associated with the decision the Son of God made, once he believed the separation really happened, to heed the ego's advice to deal with the resultant overwhelming guilt and terror in his mind by making up some other realm outside his mind in which he could exist as separate and also elude capture and punishment by what must now be a furious, wrathful God. The instant the Son decided he was not a mind by projecting himself",
    "output": "outside it could be thought of as the instant the world came into being--the Big Bang. This occurred following the earlier stages of the ego's dynamics that convinced the Son of the reality of sin, guilt, and fear. In this approach, the \"tiny, mad idea\" does not enter the Son's mind at the level of spirit, which would be impossible. The Course teaches that the Sonship \"fell\" as one--not in reality, of course. The continuity between God and His Son is eternal. It can never be ruptured. There is nothing in the Course that says part of the Sonship \"never entertained the idea of separation, never participated in the dream.\" But the clarification of terms states that Jesus \"remains a Savior because he saw the false without accepting it as true ... In His complete identification with the Christ--the perfect Son of God, His one creation and His happiness, forever like Himself and one with Him-- Jesus became what all of you must be\" (C-5.2:5; 3:1). This is a way of saying that Jesus accepted the Atonement for himself; however, there is no indication of when he did this. Perhaps it was in the very instant of the \"tiny, mad idea\"; so that in that sense it could be said that Jesus was one of the fragments that never took the idea seriously. There could have been others as well (C-5.6:1-3). For us as students of this course, however, Jesus is the teacher in our minds who, at every instant, reminds us that we can make the same choice he did: to remember to laugh at the tiny, mad idea as it manifests in our lives. He reminds us, too, that we were with him when he arose (C-6.5:5). Thus, always present in our minds, awaiting our acceptance of it, is the memory of our true Identity as Christ, forever one with His Source. For further study of this aspect of the Course's theory, we refer you to All Are Called, Volume 1 of The Message of A Course in Miracles, and our audio album, \"Separation and Forgiveness: The Four Splits and Their Undoing.\""

Every time we make an effort to do what a lesson prescribes, we are taking a \"giant stride\" toward release from our ego (W-pI.94.5:9)--\"another step toward quick salvation\" (W-pI.194.1:1).

The beginning lessons are quite short and could be read and the exercises done several times during the day, but is this advisable? Or should each lesson and exercises be done only once during the day?",
    "output": "The instructions for doing the workbook state that only one lesson be done and it can be assumed that it means only once. Some of the lessons have further instructions about repeating or recalling the thought for the day. In some lessons Jesus asks that we make specific applications throughout the day. The instructions as given in the workbook are the only guide we need for practicing. It is very important to do your best to follow the instructions as they are given, but not to judge yourself when you fail. If you could do the workbook perfectly you would not need it. Since it is a mind-training program, it is understood that we are in need of training. And no trainee is expected to perform flawlessly. The temptation to set expectations of perfection is an attempt by the ego to place itself in charge of the Atonement process. If you find it helpful, there is nothing wrong with rereading the lesson to reflect and meditate on its message, as long as you do not feel compelled or obsessed with doing the lessons. Frequently, Jesus reminds us that we should not feel any strain. His advice in Lesson 12 can be applied generally to the practice of the workbook: \"Terminate the exercises whenever you experience a sense of strain\" (W-pI.12.6:4). A sense of urgency, compulsion, or strain is an indication that the ego has snuck in to take command. That is nothing to be upset about. It only means you have become afraid. And since you cannot force yourself through fear, it is best simply to stop. Being willing to tell Jesus you are too afraid to go on, and not judging yourself for it, is more in keeping with the goal of the workbook than straining to practice perfectly. The goal is to go \" ... from one apparent lesson to the next, in easy steps that lead you gently from one to another, with no strain at all (T-31.I.2:4). We can only take one step at a time, and that is all we are asked to do."

    "text_input": "Q #1063: If I feel joy with someone for something he or she has received, I used to think this is a \"good\" thing, in that I feel with that person. But lately, through working with the Course, I had a sense of, maybe this is only fostering the illusion that we are all living in. Is this really real? Why would I want someone \"special\" to me to receive a certain award or be knighted, etc.? I feel that idols stand decidedly for \"special relationships\" serving our egos sometimes too well as means to project on good and bad things.  I don't know any more which is the ego's voice, the one which feels joy with that--special-- person or the one that says, it all means nothing. What is the Course's stance on this issue? Certainly the Holy Spirit would just go with me and say, okay, feel joy and idolatry and admiration? But then I might never let go of the illusion and projection because that person would then stand for something I would like to do/live? Or is it just my ego trying to use the Course to get me away from feeling joy?",
    "output": "Nothing in the Course asks that you not feel happiness for someone's good fortune. In fact, the Course tells us we should not only feel our emotions, but should pay attention to them as well as to the thoughts that accompany them. That is how we become aware of the mind's choice for separation. The feelings are not the cause of attachment to specialness; they are its effect. The mind's choice for separation gives rise to specialness that is then expressed in all the emotions experienced in our lives. Paying attention to your feelings and questioning them as you are is precisely what we are asked to do, for behind them are the values and beliefs that sustain the ego. Jesus' directive in this regard is very clear: \"To learn this course requires willingness to question every value that you hold\" (T-24.in.2:1). Another very important step in the learning process of the Course is to become aware of the two voices that express mutually exclusive interpretations of everything in the dream. Correctly identifying the two voices, as you have, is a significant accomplishment in itself. It means recognizing that every external situation is nothing but the reflection of the mind's choice to listen to one of the two voices. This is the foundation of the forgiveness process. The next step is to evaluate the feelings, thoughts, and judgments that are associated with every situation in this light, rather than be deceived by the specifics. You are fulfilling your part in the Atonement if you are willing to be honest with yourself about how you perceive the attainment of an award, without guessing at what the Holy Spirit's perspective would be, or thinking that you should be feeling differently. When Jesus tells us \"seek not to change the world, but choose to change your mind about the world\" (T-21.in.1:7), he is not only referring to the planet, but to the tiny world of our experiences. Changing our minds about it means seeing beyond the form to the content (the two voices). This opens the mind to the possibility of change, which is an invitation to the Holy Spirit. That is all we are asked to do. In this process of forgiveness the ego's perspective is not given full credit or credence, which weakens it. Questioning its interpretation gradually reduces the ego's hold on the emotions that flood our lives, thereby loosening their grip. They are gently changed by the simple process of questioning them, rather than by trying not to have them. This will eventually lead to the true happiness that is the goal of the Course. In contrast to the ego's roller coaster of feelings, the Holy Spirit's happiness is constant, not bound by the specialness of specific situations or relationships. Jesus distinguishes true happiness from pseudo happiness for us: \"Elusive happiness, or happiness in changing form that shifts with time and place, is an illusion that has no meaning. Happiness must be constant, because it is attained by giving up the wish for the inconstant. Joy cannot be perceived except through constant vision. And constant vision can be given only those who wish for constancy\" (T-21.VII.13:1-4). When we are ready, this happiness will be ours. Meanwhile, knowing that the learning process leads us gradually to true joy is itself a source of happiness."

    "text_input": "Q #1064: There is a lot of media coverage about alleviating world poverty. Also many people seem to be on a mission to change this world. Dr. Wapnick often points out in his audio, videos, and text that this is a mistake, as we can't change the world. Whilst I know that this is true on the level of truth, when I pray about it and ask Jesus what to make of it, I find myself reading parts of the text like \"For They Have Come\" and I get the impression that Jesus is ecstatic about it (collaboration). Jesus didn't not heal the sick or raise the dead just because sickness and death are part of the illusion (and I like to think he did do these things). On a practical level, I'd like to think if I were starving to death, someone was desperate to help me. Has this got something to do with true empathy? I almost feel guilty writing this, as I know people die of poverty as we speak.",
    "output": "Let's begin by clarifying what you think you heard Dr. Wapnick say, and what the Course is saying, about changing the world. It's not that we can't change the world--at this level people do it all the time. The point is, the world is not the real problem and to focus on it is to attempt to change effects rather than getting to the root cause of our unhappiness, which is in the mind (T- 21.in.1). The world, from the perspective of the Course, is nothing more than a projection of the thought of separation in the mind and, in the end, we will come to realize that neither of them is real. To seek to change the world outside is to avoid solving the real problem within. This kind of admonition is directed to students of the Course and has meaning only from the perspective of the Course's metaphysical principles. For someone who resonates to a different spiritual path, it most likely will make little or no sense. And so it would certainly be a mistake to use the Course's teachings to judge others who are seeking to bring about what they perceive as meaningful change in the world, such as alleviating suffering. We simply have no way of knowing what will be most helpful for others on their Atonement paths. It's important to understand that the Course is never speaking about behavior, but only about the thoughts in the mind and, in particular, what purpose those thoughts are giving to whatever we seem to find ourselves doing in the world. The Course would never say don't help others in need, or don't try to eliminate world hunger, for example. But it would say pay attention to whatever thoughts are behind your actions. And if, for example, you are seeing the poor and the helpless at the mercy of unscrupulous governments and corporations or impersonal forces of nature, you are reinforcing your belief in victims and victimizers, as well as in differences, separation and loss. And that kind of false empathy, which makes distinctions between the innocent and the guilty, truly helps no one for it denies the power of each mind to have chosen its external circumstances as a way to protect its decision for individuality and specialness, and therefore to make a different choice for healing and wholeness (T-16.I.1-2). And this is what we all continue to do until we are at last willing to ask for another way, which has nothing to do with changing the world and everything to do with changing our own mind. Following up on this third point, it is a misunderstanding of Jesus' meaning in \"For They Have Come\" (T-26.IX) to interpret it as if he were speaking about what bodies do with each other. He is referring to a change in perception, which happens in the mind, which may or may not then be expressed in actions. Yes, he does speak of how \"no one on earth but offers thanks to one who has restored his home, and sheltered him from bitter winter and the freezing cold\" (T-26.IX.7:3), but only to make the point of how much more grateful we will be to have our true Home restored to us. As for whether Jesus performed the miracles reported in the gospels, it is important to remember that the gospel writers, whom many biblical scholars believe were not eyewitnesses to his life, were writing their accounts to demonstrate that Jesus was special, different from everyone else, divine. If persons experienced healings in the presence of Jesus' love, it seems very unlikely that it would have happened in the magical ways described in the gospel stories. Rather, being reminded of the love that was within them, they would have released the guilt in their minds and no longer have needed to maintain its projection in the form of their symptoms (M-5.II.2). Jesus' compassion was not for the suffering and crippled bodies the eyes see, but for the suffering and crippled minds that were choosing to believe that illness and pain were somehow necessary for salvation. That those who witnessed his compassion two thousands years ago misunderstood his message and interpreted it in terms of expressing care and concern for those less fortunate than oneself--reinforcing a belief in real differences and separation--is not surprising. For just look at how Jesus' students today continue to misunderstand his message in the Course, even though it is presented in much more direct and unambiguous language."

    "text_input": "Q #1065: I started working really hard on myself spiritually about 20 years ago, using the Course for the last ten years. I thought that the fact that my life had evolved from one of extreme difficulty, pain and hardship to one very much improved signified I was on the right track. All that ended when I lost the one really good job I've ever had due to a downsizing six years ago. Since then, I have had three very long periods of unemployment in between two horrible jobs that also were eliminated.  These past six years have been a real \"dark night of the soul\" for me, and I have faced some even deeper and more horrifying things about myself than I had realized were there. My guilt seems so vast, and my ego seems to be especially vicious. Despite my attempts to have a relationship with Jesus, I feel that I receive no help from him or from anyone else.  While I realize that I shouldn't expect to see any outward manifestation of my spiritual efforts, I do need to be able to support myself financially. I would give anything to understand what happened inside myself to suddenly change my circumstances. I feel that I have been doing everything I possibly can to help myself, but I feel as though I am at the mercy of something I have no control over.  What does it take to put an end to extreme circumstances caused by (what I am guessing to be) an ego investment in victimhood/martyrdom? I feel that \"I\" am not choosing these situations for myself, yet I am forced to deal with the consequences. Is it really enough to say, \"Oh, that's just my ego acting up and causing trouble,\" and then just do whatever I can to feel at peace? Please tell me specifically step by step what my thoughts should be.  Is there any validity to the idea that feelings of worthlessness are broadcast to the universe as an invitation for mistreatment (in order to intensify guilt)? What concept, idea, or lesson from the Course could I focus on to make the biggest difference to me right now? How do I convince myself that Jesus does care, even when I see no reason to believe he does or to have faith in him?",
    "output": "There really can be no satisfactory answer at this level to explain why each of our lives plays out in the specific form that it does. And so to look for specific causes in our thoughts, such as \"the ego's investment in victimhood/martyrdom\" only serves to reinforce our feelings of guilt, as you are experiencing. The Course has no prescription for changing our life's circumstances. Rather it offers a different way of perceiving or interpreting the events of our lives, whatever they may be, which will allow us to be increasingly peaceful and eventually to disidentify with the self we have believed we are. As Jesus says early in the text, \"How else can you find joy in a joyless place except by realizing that you are not there?\" (T-6.II.6:1). You are right, the self you believe you are is not making the decisions about what will happen in your life. While there may at times seem to be some correlation between our conscious thoughts and our external circumstances, the correspondence is by no means consistent nor predictable. And believing that there should be some congruence, as you thought when your situation seemed to be getting better as you integrated various spiritual teachings into your life, can be a real ego setup, as you then found out. Yet we are not victims of some powerful mind over which we have no control. It is just that, because of our own fear of accepting responsibility for the ego, the part of our mind that is making choices is usually out of conscious awareness for most of us other than for the briefest instant (W-pI.136.3-5). And so it is unlikely that we will understand all of what is involved in determining our specific experiences as bodies in the world, nor is it necessary. So judging ourselves and laying a guilt trip on ourselves for what we judge to be our difficult life circumstances is both misguided and counterproductive and you should stop doing it right now! The notion that our feelings of worthlessness invite mistreatment from the universe may be part of other spiritual teachings, but not the Course. The Course would say that we believe that guilt calls for punishment (T-26.VII.3:1-2) and so we seek to suffer in order to atone for our sinfulness, but the suffering is always simply the result of a choice for separation in the mind and not the consequence of anything external. In other words, a mind identified with guilt will interpret an external event or situation as punitive, while a healed mind not identified with guilt will see nothing punitive about the same external circumstance. These alternative ways of viewing the same event are clearly contrasted in Jesus' discussion of the crucifixion (T-6.I). And so it is most helpful to think of guilt as dictating our interpretation of what seems to be happening to us in the world, rather than as dictating what the events themselves shall be at an individual level. Having said this, your external circumstances nevertheless can be used by the Holy Spirit if you allow yourself to see, not the externals themselves, but your reactions to them as expressions of your identification with the ego in your mind, which is the one thing you have a real choice about. What is most challenging and difficult about this process for most of us is that the outer situation may not change and most of us want to see \"positive\" change in our lives as proof we are healing our mind. But the Course's purpose is to lead us to an ever-deepening experience of peace (T-8.I.1:1-2; T-13.II.7:1), no matter what may seem to be happening to our bodies. As for the vastness of your guilt, that is your perception simply because you are looking at the guilt with your ego, which must see it as huge and serious in order to maintain its own existence in your mind. The ego can not tolerate your considering it as insignificant or silly. And that specifically is what Jesus can help you with. If you're looking to him to help you get your life back on track, you'll be sorely disappointed in the long run. But if you're looking to him to remind you that your guilt is not real and that you already have what you need to be happy in your mind-- you're just blocking it from your awareness--he's always ready to help. You just have to ask. And so the specific steps you ask for would be first to acknowledge, whenever anything in your life circumstances seems to be upsetting you, that the real problem is that you have chosen the ego as your teacher to help you interpret what seems to be happening to you, and the ego's only teaching goal is to reinforce the buried guilt in your mind by viewing the situation as a punishment for that guilt. The next step is to recognize that, if the ego is a choice, there must be an alternative teacher available in your mind, and Jesus is simply waiting on your invitation. His purpose will not be to change the external situation but to help you look at the guilt you have made real in your own mind and see its insignificance. When you are willing to join with him, this is what he will help you see, or rather, not see! Then, when you look back at the external situation, you will no longer be looking at it through the lens of guilt and you will no longer need to see it as punitive. And what is called for is not faith in Jesus that he will help you, but faith in your own power of choice, that you will be willing to look at the guilt you have made real in your own mind and then ask for the help to see through it and beyond it to the love that is always there. You may find the section in the text \"The Real Alternative\" (T-31.IV) a helpful one for reflecting on the issues that you are confronting. In very clear and direct language, Jesus addresses the futility of looking for any answers in the world, but also reminds us of where the happiness we are looking for can truly be found."

    "text_input": "Q #1066: From an ego vantage point, most ego-based activities are male oriented. For example, traditionally and most frequently the areas of sports, war, politics, business, wealth accumulation, prestige cars, boats, airplanes, sexual promiscuity, construction, attack mentality, are all male-oriented values and activities. Women participate in all of the above but in much diminished ratio. Perhaps ego-based drives are hormone driven, and that what we ascribe to the ego may well be a condition of testosterone presence--our bodies influencing how our mind thinks by its innate chemistry. Many studies confirm this indeed. If this has some truth to it, then it would seem that we have two different types of egos: one male and the other female. Could it be that as we are not equal in our bodies, we are not equal in our ego strategies either?",
    "output": "In A Course in Miracles, the ego is ascribed exclusively to the mind, which is totally independent of physical organs and systems. \"The ego is the part of the mind that believes your existence is defined by separation\" (T-4.VII.1:5). Ego-based activities and values thus are expressions of the mind's decision to sustain an autonomous existence as an individual apart from God. To secure this, the mind disowns its identity as a mind, so to speak, by projecting itself into a complex bodily system that is part of a larger much more complex physical world. The mind's goal, once it has identified with the separation from God, is to protect itself by remaining oblivious of its origins and the dynamics by which it became essentially mindless. It obliterates from its awareness the proper relationship between cause and effect, so that it now believes that bodily states and conditions (chemical, for example) are causal--they cause mental experiences. This is what Jesus describes as \"level confusion\" early in the Course (see T-2.IV.2), and the restoring of the proper relationship of cause and effect is the objective of a major part of his teaching throughout the Course (see, for example, \"The Responsibility for Sight\" [T-21.II]; \"Reversing Effect and Cause\" [T-28.II]). In a section on healing in the manual for teachers, Jesus defines sickness as a \"faulty problem- solving approach\" (the problem being our fear that God will take back our identity as individuals, which we granted ourselves at His expense); and as such, it must be a decision made by the mind, not the body (M-5.II.1:5-6). Then he says something of paramount significance: \"The resistance to recognizing this is enormous, because the existence of the world as you perceive it depends on the body being the decision maker. Terms like 'instincts,' 'reflexes' and the like represent attempts to endow the body with non-mental motivators. Actually, such terms merely state or describe the problem. They do not answer it\" (M-5.II.2:7-10). We can easily add hormones to the list. The mind (the ego) is neither male nor female, as it transcends all materiality. Sexes and the chemical systems that define them are the effects of the mind's decision to block its awareness of itself as a decision-making mind, making it appear as if external causes now are responsible for how we think and what we do. Our activities, therefore, are traceable not to a decision-making mind intent on remaining separate from God, but to a complex physical/chemical system that itself is affected by external forces and systems. Male and female hormonal systems are part of the ego mind's strategy to focus our attention on form rather than content. Thus, though different in form, the content of all ego-based activities is the same. That is the function of the miracle--it is a shift in our thinking that gets us beyond the differences in form to sameness of content so that we can focus our attention on the \"real\" problem, which is the decision we made as minds, and continue to uphold, to remain as individuals, as God did not create us."

    "text_input": "Q #1067: As I understand it, the process of A Course in Miracles' is to look at painful feelings, understand they are not the effect of the situation from which they seem to spring, but that they are the ego's way to try to keep us focused on our bodies rather than our minds. Am I right? I believe Ken has said that when we look at those feelings in that way, we're automatically looking with the Holy Spirit. However, if in following this practice, the negative feelings do not dissipate and we do not feel a sense of peace, does that mean we are doing it wrong? I'm asking because of this passage in the Course: \"How can you know whether you chose the stairs to Heaven or the way to hell? Quite easily. How do you feel? Is peace in your awareness?\" (T- 23.II.22:6-9).",
    "output": "A clarification of the process as you've described it--it's not the painful feelings themselves that are the ego's way of keeping us focused on the body, but the ego's interpretation of those feelings, which deceptively looks to the body and the world to account for them. The pain is actually a thought in the mind (T-13.III.6-7) that comes from embracing the \"tiny, mad idea\" of separation (T-8.IV.5:7-8), having nothing to do with the body and the world (W-pI.132.10). As Jesus unequivocally notes, \"The cause of pain is separation, not the body, which is only its effect\" (T-28.III.5:1). But so long as we look to relieve our pain only by changing things about our body and our circumstances in the world, we remain mindless. And the pain--and the thought of separation, which is the ego-- remain protected and beyond the possibility of change. Whenever we look beyond the ego's subterfuge and recognize that we are responsible for what we feel, and that the decision for pain rests in our mind (T-21.II.2), we must have chosen the Holy Spirit rather than the ego as our teacher in that moment of awareness or we would never have recognized the real source of our pain. However, our fear of letting go of everything that comes with the pain--including the self we believe we are--may lead us to vacillate between the Holy Spirit and the ego. As a result, pain may remain in our awareness and in our experience, until we can in a holy instant release it completely to the Holy Spirit in our mind. In general, if we are honest with ourselves in acknowledging the truth about what we have been feeling and why, even if the feelings do not dissipate completely, we will begin to experience a release from the rigid hold that those feelings had seemed to have over us, and we will have at least taken the first step up Heaven's stairs. For the possibility of peace will now be in our awareness."

    "text_input": "Q #1068: A Course in Miracles seems to say that the Holy Spirit both perceives (e.g., that I am sitting here at my computer) and has knowledge. It is a bit strange that the Holy Spirit seems to unite contradictories. Generally only God and Christ have knowledge.",
    "output": "This is a question of language inconsistencies in the Course. Jesus is correcting our long-held misconceptions about God, Christ, the Holy Spirit, and himself. But he must do so using language and concepts we are familiar with and can accept. Above all, Jesus wants us to know that God and the Holy Spirit are not part of a conspiracy of some kind to lure us into a trap and then destroy us because of our sins. However he can get this loving message across to us is how he will proceed. Thus he will use language that says that the Holy Spirit perceives us as either calling out for love or extending it--this is part of his larger message that sin is not real. He is speaking to our needs--our longing to be assured that God loves us and never condemns--and therefore he must speak in ways we can relate to. If you study the Course with this in mind, you will not be confused by the language. You will see there is no contradiction in its content. Jesus is getting a loving message across to us, and his language will be relative to the point he is making. In the clarification of terms at the end of the manual for teachers, Jesus tells us: \"The Holy Spirit is described as the remaining Communication Link between God and His separated Sons. In order to fill this special function the Holy Spirit has assumed a dual function. He knows because He is part of God; He perceives because He was sent to save humanity. He is the great correction principle; the bringer of true perception, the inherent power of the vision of Christ ... He seems to be a Guide through a far country, for you need that form of help. He seems to be whatever meets the needs you think you have\" (C-6.3:1-4; 4:6-7). But when we awaken from the dream, we will not need a Voice (form) to remind us that we are only dreaming we are separate from God: \"And then the Voice is gone, no longer to take form but to return to the eternal formlessness of God\" (C-6.5:8)."

    "output": "You do not have to die to reach Atonement. Atonement is a shift that takes place in your mind whereby you now see with Christ's vision, not the ego's. What that means is that you see everyone as the same instead of as different, with different and competing interests and goals. You clearly see separation as an illusion. You can still be here with a healed mind, but you would realize that living as a body in a physical world is not your real identity, and you would also realize that that is true of your loved ones as well, which makes loneliness impossible. You do not have to die to have this realization. It is a state of mind that A Course in Miracles calls the real world. You do not disappear in the Heart of God the instant you accept the Atonement: \"Fear not that you will be abruptly lifted up and hurled into reality,\" Jesus assures us (T- 16.VI.8:1). The process of awakening is a gentle one: \"God willed he waken gently and with joy, and gave him means to waken without fear\" (T-27.VII.13:5). Only when the world and all forms of separation are meaningless to you will they disappear from your mind--but not before then. We are never asked to sacrifice what we still want (T-30.V.9:4-5)."

    "text_input": "Q #1070: About 8 or so years ago, I had several strange experiences. I felt an energy come over me, up my back and into my head. At first I was frightened and said no to it. After a time or two I gave in to it. What happened next took a second or two. I had a glimpse of--what? I'm not sure; it was so fast. But I think I knew everything. It was like a revelation. I remember saying, \"So, that's what it's all about!\" Then I promptly forgot what I saw. This happened about 4 or 5 times--I had no control over when. One time I was at the movies. Another peeling potatoes at the sink! The feeling went away as quickly as it came. I haven't had that experience since, yet I can't forget it. Can you shed any light on it?",
    "output": "It is difficult to know for certain what these experiences may have been. Generally speaking, if an experience leaves you feeling less guilty, fearful, and judgmental, and kinder and more loving toward everyone, it came from the part of your mind that is linked to the truth about reality and the Love of God that is its source. A Course in Miracles teaches us that our minds are split between that part and the other part that fiercely and even viciously protects its perceived independence from God. The decision-making aspect is always choosing to identify with one or the other. One manifestation of choosing the right-minded part would be an experience such as the one you had, where you suddenly realize \"what it's all about.\" We are not usually aware of these instants of decision, although the point of the mind-training dimension of the Course is to help us become more aware of them; and since linear time is part of the ego's strategy to keep us away from our mind, the fact that this happened 8 years ago is not important. Your promptly forgetting what you saw could be interpreted as a reaction of fear to what you saw since your ego defends with all its puny might against such glimpses of truth, as it knows its existence is threatened should you see the truth and then choose for it instead of against it. These dynamics are going on all the time, and in the early stages of our work with the Course, our objective is to see our lives in that context, with our focus on which teacher we are choosing to direct us in our daily interactions: Jesus or the ego. So the experience you had could be used as a reference point, a kind of confirmation of your right-minded self; but it is best not to try to re- create it or go back to it. Just focus on the present, that right now in this instant you are choosing; try to become aware of which teacher or thought system you are choosing. Don't judge your choice, just observe it, and as you go on, evaluate the effects as something that is bringing you peace or more conflict."

    "text_input": "Q #1071: Is the decision maker in \"me\" different from the decision maker in other people? Who is the \"I\" who is responsible for the decision, the \"you\" that A Course in Miracles addresses? On that same note, does this decision maker continue in some form, even after death, until he has made the decision to relinquish the separation? Would any progress in this \"lifetime\" carry on?",
    "output": "When thinking about these kinds of issues, it is always helpful to recall that we are attempting to provide a rational context for something that is inherently illusory and originally spawned from the wish to oppose what is eternally true. Our human framework of explanation is the only one available to us, but as part of the attempt to deny truth, it is necessarily limited. Jesus cautions us about these limitations in different ways throughout the Course. Yet he must meet us where we are so he can help us identify our mistakes and then correct them once we have accepted him as our teacher. Our primary mistake has been to believe that something other than the perfect Oneness of God's Love is real. As is evident in our reactions to everyday occurrences, we rarely question the reality of multiplicity--that we are all real as separate individuals in a universe of diverse entities of all kinds. Skipping over the ego dynamics hidden within our minds, which include the terrorizing fear that we are going to be punished for our existence as individuals, let us look at Jesus' description of this situation. He speaks of it as a process of substitution: \"It has taken many forms, because it was the substitution of illusion for truth; of fragmentation for wholeness. It has become so splintered and subdivided and divided again, over and over, that it is now almost impossible to perceive it once was one, and still is what it was. That one error, which brought truth to illusion, infinity to time, and life to death, was all you ever made. Your whole world rests upon it. Everything you see reflects it, and every special relationship that you ever made is part of it\" (T-18.I.4:2-6). Jesus is clearly speaking to a mind that is living out the effects of its decision to substitute \"illusion for truth\" and \"fragmentation for wholeness.\" He could not be talking to us as bodies because he knows bodies are nothing more than projections of the mind, and therefore are lifeless. All that is important is helping us recover our awareness of ourselves as minds. Given our investment in separation and fragmentation, it appears that we are individual decision- making minds, different one from another; and it is not wrong to think this at the beginning stages of one's work with the Course. But the natural outcome of practicing forgiveness is the gradual dissolving of this sense that we are separate from each other, which means we will be moving back in the direction of oneness--first in terms of recognizing we all share a common interest, and then in realizing we share the same Identity as God's Son. At this level of correction we would know there is only one mind. We no longer would be choosing to substitute fragmentation for wholeness and illusion for truth, and therefore we would gradually accept oneness as the truth, and experience separation as less and less attractive. #663 also discusses this issue and cites relevant passages in the Course. Death is a decision made by a mind for either a right-minded or a wrong-minded purpose. In other words, it is part of the continuum of the mind's ongoing decision either to uphold the illusion of separation or to undo it. The mind is not in the body, so the mind is not changed in any way when the body dies. It is affected only by its own choices. From this perspective, death is irrelevant, although from the perspective of the world clearly it is not. See Questions #68 and #494 for further discussion and references. To ask whether we carry with us what we learn in this lifetime is to assume that time is linear, and A Course in Miracles teaches that it is not. We always have to return to the reference point of a mind that is outside time and space deciding between two teachers and their thought systems. It is very humbling to be asked to disregard our experience as a reference point for understanding issues like these, but we really must raise ourselves to Jesus' level if we are going to make progress in understanding his teachings. Time and space are part of the ego's strategy to convince us that we are bodies--to substitute fragmentation for wholeness, as quoted above. The learning takes place only on the level of the decision-making mind outside time and space--and it is essentially learning that its choice for the thought system of separation was a mistake, which can now be corrected."

    "text_input": "Q #1072: When we seem to die, that is, lay aside our body in one of many possible ways: accident, suicide, being murdered or after a prolonged illness, and we have not learned forgiveness, is it mandatory that we return to this world to learn our lessons? If we do not wish to return and since forgiveness occurs only in the mind, does the mind have to project itself into a phenomenal world to learn forgiveness? The reason for this question is that I seem to be going backwards in learning the Course and I have reached the biblical three score and ten with questionable health issues. I have no wish to return in a projected material form and would prefer to work out my salvation in the abstract or mind state of existence. This question by the way, along with my other questions, will be manifest confirmations of my backwardness in understanding the Course. That is not false humility begging for contradiction but simply a recognition of my limitations. But as the Course says, I planned it that way. Better stop while I'm not too far behind.",
    "output": "Cute. But you may first want to remember that you are never in a position to evaluate your progress with the Course along your Atonement path (T-18.V.1). In fact, acknowledging your difficulties in mastering and applying Course concepts and principles probably puts you a good deal farther along than those students who believe they are progressing quite nicely on their path, thank you. For you at least are not in denial about how challenging this set of teachings can be to understand and put into practice! But your mistake comes in believing that you are here in projected material form now and would prefer not to return to such a state in the future after this lifetime has been completed. The fact is, like every other seemingly separate aspect of the Sonship, you always have been, are and will remain in the mind, and that is the only \"place\" where salvation can be found. This mind has created a vast array of symbols, some of which it has chosen to identify with (e.g., T-6.V-A.2:2; T-12.III.8:4; T-13.in.2:4; T-28.VI.3:10; 4:1; W-pI.161:5,6), but the fact is that the mind never resides within any of its symbols. Rather the symbols remain always within the mind, at least for as long as we wish to believe that we are separate from our Source. And so, rather than being concerned with how much longer you may continue to experience the particular set of symbols that you currently identify as yourself and this lifetime, or what symbols you may relate to in an imaginary \"future\" life, you could do better to watch what you have made real right now with as little judgment as you can, simply observing the self you think you are and all the other selves that this self seems to be relating to. And by that very process of observing, without valuing either positively or negatively, you are actually, little by little, distancing yourself from the symbols and reinforcing your identity as mind, which is all Jesus is inviting you to remember. We all in fact are dealing with seeming abstractions of mind--sin, guilt, fear and attack--that we have sought to make into concrete and specific symbols so that we might avoid the truly abstract nature of mind--the rarefied atmosphere of total oneness in which the ego can not survive (W-pI.161.2-4,7-8)."

    "text_input": "Q #1073: I am relatively new to A Course in Miracles. I am wondering if it might not be more beneficial for a student to use magic in the illusion to address the ego's threat before trying to incorporate the Course into our daily lives. If we use the magic of psychology to address issues such as self-hate and destructive behaviors, and come to a place where we love and forgive ourselves fully in this illusion, will it not help to see the Course as a method to change the mind and not so much as a source of help in this illusion? For example I am going through a tough time at the moment and am looking for small miracles to help me through it. But I fully understand that the Course is not intended for this illusion. It leaves me feeling alone and fearful (the ego). But if I come to accept and love and forgive myself through magic it will be easier to aim for the higher purpose.",
    "output": "The use of magic is never wrong, and in fact Jesus tells us that it is a wise choice when we are so gripped by a condition that we cannot effectively deal with the ego dynamics in our minds. He calls this a \"compromise approach to mind and body, in which something from the outside is temporarily given healing belief\" (T-2.IV.4:6). This approach is summarized in a passage we often quote: \"The value of the Atonement does not lie in the manner in which it is expressed. In fact, if it is used truly, it will inevitably be expressed in whatever way is most helpful to the receiver. This means that a miracle, to attain its full efficacy, must be expressed in a language that the recipient can understand without fear\" (T-2.IV.5:1-3). Thus, external intervention often is the kindest and most helpful direction to take when there is a pattern of destructive behavior triggered by intense self-hatred. But you would not necessarily have to reach the level where you love and forgive yourself totally before you can work with the Course and benefit from it. Even without the element of destructive behavior, most people have not reached that level. If they did, they would not need the Course. Jesus is addressing people at the bottom of the ladder of spirituality, not the top. As is indicated in dozens and dozens of passages, he clearly is aware of the wretched self-images we all carry around with us. (See, for example, W-pI.93 and W-pI.191.) It could not be otherwise, given the means by which we acquired our existence: attacking and rejecting perfect Love and Oneness. Once our behavior is under control and we can function reasonably well in the world, the Course can be helpful in teaching us how to relate to ourselves and others in a way that would gradually diminish self-hatred, guilt, and judgment, and bring about a more peaceful way of proceeding through our everyday interactions. In this sense, the Course is helpful in the illusion. It helps us who are rooted in it to gently begin the process of easing ourselves out of it."

    "text_input": "Q #1074: Do we keep our learning into the next life? I am finding judgment to be so pervasive, that it seems almost impossible to find my way home in just this lifetime.",
    "output": "A lifetime is but a classroom with a set of lessons on the Son of God's return to his true home. There will be lifetimes as long as the mind believes the thought of separation is real and that there is a choice to be made between truth and illusion. Each time the mind chooses the illusion of separation it projects its guilt for making that choice in the form of judgments. The single thought that the separation did in fact occur, and therefore the world of illusion is real, stands behind the myriad of seemingly different judgments and lifetimes. From this single thought, all judgment and every lifetime is brought forth. The goal of A Course in Miracles is to teach us to distinguish between what is true and what is false, and to train our minds to recognize the effects of the mind's choice. This process may take lifetimes because of the unwillingness to choose to believe that only truth is true, and what is false will never bring happiness. Every judgment brings misery; every lifetime ends in death. Indeed, every lifetime begins with a death blow to God's Son. What seems to be learning is actually a process of remembering the truth by unlearning the ego's thought system. The mind that has forgotten uses the body, the world, and many lifetimes to remember its true Identity and to forget everything else. Of itself the body does nothing; in fact, \"At no single instant does the body exist at all\" (T-18.VII.3:1). Clearly, then, the remembering process goes on with or without the body; it precedes birth and outlives death. And since unlearning/remembering occurs only in the mind, it is not happening in any \"lifetime\"; a term we associate with the lifespan of the body measured by linear time. Ironically, this is now called \"real time.\" The Course would call it \"illusory time\" and tells us it takes no time at all to choose against the ego. Fortunately, we do not need to reverse every judgment that we hold stockpiled in our arsenal of attack thoughts. The only \"judgment\" that needs to be reversed is the decision to side with the ego in its interpretation of the separation. If every judgment is the projection of guilt for having made that decision, judgments end when the mind decides in favor of the Holy Spirit instead of the ego. When that decision is made unequivocally, all judgment ends, as does all belief in the illusion of the world and the lifetimes spent in it. At that point: \"Your foot has reached the lawns that welcome you to Heaven's gate; the quiet place of peace, where you await with certainty the final step of God\" (W-pI.194.1:3). Meanwhile, it is important to continue patiently uncovering the judgments that reveal the mind's mistaken belief that separation is possible and God's Son has been put to death. Each one is an opportunity to consider the insanity of this belief as well as its painful effects, in order to move closer to the final decision against the ego's madness."

    "text_input": "Q #1075: What does A Course in Miracles say about angels? Also, what about people who seem to see an evil presence? I was raised in Christian Science and I have not come across anything they do not have in common with the Course. Christian Science believes that evil spirits do not exist, and that there is nothing other than God's power. It says we create in our minds, and anything that is not absolute is not real. Although Christian Science does not use the same terminology as the Course does, it, too, says this is a illusion.",
    "output": "As we discussed in #413, angels in A Course in Miracles are regarded as extensions of God's Thought. In this sense, they are symbols of the light and protection of God that always surrounds us, since in truth we never left Him (T-18.VI.10:6; W-pII.264.h). If we are too afraid of that level of our Identity, our minds would translate the experience of formless Love into form, and one form might be angelic beings or entities. But the form is not the reality. The idea would be to relate to what they symbolize, and then go beyond that to the Source, which is always the Love that transcends anything of form. This same kind of thinking would apply to the perception of an evil presence. We are so heavily bound to form that we immediately translate thoughts into form: \"Everything you recognize you identify with externals, something outside itself. You cannot even think of God without a body, or in some form you think you recognize\" (T-18.VIII.1:6-7). The core of the ego is hatred and murder, and sometimes that can be experienced as an evil presence; but the Course helps us by teaching us not to be afraid of it, for it has no reality other than what we give to it --coming from our guilt and fear over believing we destroyed God in order to have our own existence. About Christian Science ... As we discussed in Questions #372 and #512, there are parallels on the metaphysical level of teachings between Christian Science and A Course in Miracles; but there are significant differences as well. And of course that does not make one system superior to the other--just different. One difference is that according to the Course's theory, God knows nothing of the world because it does not exist as something real. As an illusion, it will disappear from our awareness when we let go of our belief in separation. At the level of purpose and practice there are differences as well. A major purpose of Christian Science is the healing of illnesses, with these healings then demonstrating the validity of its principles. The primary focus of the Course's process is the healing of our minds of the guilt that is hidden there. Healing the body is never the goal, although that may be an effect of the mind's healing. The Course's view of forgiveness also distinguishes it from other paths. We are asked to have the willingness to forgive our brothers for what they did not do (T-17.III.1:5); and so a central aspect of one's work with the Course is developing a relationship with Jesus or the Holy Spirit, so that we may turn to Them regularly for help in choosing right-minded perceptions of everything in our lives. The questions cited at the beginning fill in the details of this brief answer. Of most importance, again, is that differences not be turned into judgments of one or the other thought system."

    "text_input": "Q #1076: As I have moved along on my forgiveness path, I am obviously becoming less judgmental, less critical, and less fearful. This is not to say that I am by any means free of these things but I sense that my non-verbal energy and body language emit a sense of acceptance and non-judgment to others, both in right-minded moments and generally. What I am amazingly finding, though, is that women are less attracted to me this way. I guess what I am asking you is: \"Is it possible that some people will not like us when we seem less judgmental?\" Can you explain, what seems to me to be a fascinating psychological concept: that some people will be turned off and threatened when we are not judgmental? I thought that a Teacher of God was supposed to teach messages of hope and acceptance.",
    "output": "It may be helpful to remember that A Course in Miracles does not ask that we not have judgments. Jesus tells us not to judge because we cannot judge (W-pI.154.1; M-10.2:1). What we call judgment, critical or otherwise, is perception; and we are perceiving all the time: \"Perception is a continual process of accepting and rejecting, organizing and reorganizing, shifting and changing. Evaluation is an essential part of perception, because judgments are necessary in order to select\" (T-3.V.7:7-8). That is because the mind's decision to believe in separation results in guilt that is projected out and experienced in the world in the form of separation between one's self and everybody else. Whether the \"other\" is perceived negatively or positively does not matter. In fact, the ego goes to great lengths to refine its distinctions between those considered to be friend or foe, desirable or undesirable, attractive or unattractive. We comply with the guidelines of the Course's mind training by learning to recognize these \"judgments\" in every interaction, rather than trying to be without them. It is possible to act quite normal while monitoring the mind in this way. Indeed, it is normal to have judgments. What makes this Course simple, albeit not easy, is the single function we are given, which is to look honestly at whatever speck of darkness still remains to block the full awareness of love's presence. That is all we are required to do. Whatever else has previously been accomplished in letting go of judgment remains safe in the hands of the Holy Spirit. It is not meant to be used as a means to establish differences between oneself and others. The only thing we are asked to do when we find ourselves with someone who is judgmental and critical, is pay attention to our own thoughts of judgment about the person who is judging. Fortunately, we are not responsible for others' perception of us. When the mind chooses to listen to the ego it can misperceive even the most beautiful reflection of the right mind; e.g., the figure of Jesus and A Course in Miracles. From the perspective of the right mind it does not matter how anyone perceives us. From the wrong mind we are so busy misperceiving ourselves it also does not matter. Again, all we ever need to do is pay attention to any thought that hints (or glares) of separation and difference. People usually do prefer the company of those who share their judgments. To that end, groups of all kinds are organized; many of which involve judgments against those who do not share their values/judgments. This is not surprising, considering the ingenious separative devices of the ego thought system. So there are probably as many women who find a lack of criticism attractive as there are who don't. While on the level of form you follow the shifting flow of attraction and attractiveness, the goal of practicing the principles of the Course in every relationship remains unaltered. And that is all that matters. In this regard we may slightly paraphrase what Jesus tells us: \"Forget not that the healing of God's Son is all [a relationship] is for\" (T-24.VI.4:1)."

They just run on, and when I remember I try to watch them: i.e., I am not thinking them at all; they are just happening inside me. They just appear, though on the whole they are quite negative and I still often identify with them and get sucked back into them. And I still see myself as a body having these separate thoughts which I witness rather than a mind witnessing them. Though it is obvious that many of these thoughts relate to the body and influence the way the body feels and what it/I want to do. Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj said that all the personality is, is a stream of memory. That's what it seems to me from watching the thoughts arising in me, but I still see them as me.",
    "output": "Our work with A Course in Miracles is aimed at getting us back to full awareness of ourselves as decision-making minds so that we can see clearly that we are always choosing between one of two thoughts: that of the ego or that of the Holy Spirit. The seeming endless stream of thoughts we experience are really variations of these two fundamental thoughts. That is why Jesus places such emphasis on the content of our thinking, and asks us to learn to place less stress on the forms in our lives. As you watch your thoughts, thus, you can also acknowledge-- being careful not to judge yourself--that you are choosing to identify with a separate bodily self, a special bodily self, a body that lives in time and space, a fearful bodily self, etc. The you that is making this choice cannot be the body. Then what should come up very quickly is why you, as a mind, would choose to identify with the body. Your thinking, thus, would shift to purpose: there must be a purpose the body is serving that keeps you so rooted in it. But because we are so heavily defended against seeing ourselves as minds, this process of moving from body to mind can take quite some time. It does not happen overnight. And in his characteristic gentleness, Jesus tells us that we do not have to let go of this identification for more than an instant: \"You are not asked to let this happen for more than an instant, yet it is in this instant that the miracle of Atonement happens. Afterwards you will see the body again, but never quite the same\" (T-18.VII.2:3-4). Concentrating on the purpose the body serves thus will help you move along in the process of disidentifying with it. It was made by our self-serving ego to convince us that we are indeed separate, but are not responsible for that, as evidenced by the \"innocent victim\" experiences that pervade our lives. As you practice seeing that dynamic in operation in your daily life, you can recall that the body can serve a different purpose by your choosing Jesus instead of the ego as your teacher. You then will use the body to learn more about the interests we all share in common. In your practice of this, you will gradually be shifting your identification from your body to your mind."

    "output": "The following are the two passages where the eagle and sparrow metaphor is used: \"Those who choose freedom will experience only its results. Their power is of God, and they will give it only to what God has given, to share with them. Nothing but this can touch them, for they see only this, sharing their power according to the Will of God. And thus their freedom is established and maintained. It is upheld through all temptation to imprison and to be imprisoned. It is of them who learned of freedom that you should ask what freedom is. Ask not the sparrow how the eagle soars, for those with little wings have not accepted for themselves the power to share with you\" (T-20.IV.4). \"When this power has once been experienced, it is impossible to trust one's own petty strength again. Who would attempt to fly with the tiny wings of a sparrow when the mighty power of an eagle has been given him? And who would place his faith in the shabby offerings of the ego when the gifts of God are laid before him? What is it that induces them to make the shift?\" (M- 4.I.2) The Glossary Index and the electronic version of A Course in Miracles are very helpful tools for finding specific passages.

    "text_input": "Q #1079: I recently read the book Miracle Detective by Randal Sullivan. The book is basically about apparitions of Mary all over the world. He also discusses other types of miracles as reported by the Catholic Church. Near the end of the book he interviews a priest who said he knew Helen Schucman, the scribe of A Course in Miracles. He reported that near the end of her life, he visited her often in the hospital where he heard her \"bad mouth\" the Course, saying how she wished that she were never involved. He said that this made him seriously concerned about the origin of the Course, as maybe not from Jesus. This is absolutely not going to stop me from doing the Course, but I was curious about whether Helen actually felt like this. A: Kenneth's book Absence from Felicity gives a comprehensive account of Helen's life and relationship with Jesus and the Course, which is always helpful as a context for considering reports such as the one you mention. As Kenneth relates, near the end of her life Helen suffered from pancreatic cancer, which had gone undetected for a long time. It had impinged on her liver, and as a result, her whole body, including her brain, was extremely toxic. This poisoning throughout her body led her to act in ways that were not normal for her. One of these uncharacteristic expressions was to say negative things about the Course. Until her final illness, however, she never did anything like this. Again, Kenneth's book provides a helpful context for understanding this kind of behavior.",

    "output": "No, you cannot forgive an illusion. To say you forgive the ego would give it a reality it does not have, and would mean that the separation did occur. Forgiveness is a change of mind, whereby belief in the illusion of separation (the ego) is replaced with the memory of God's Love (the Holy Spirit). The separation did not happen (T-6.II.10) and therefore there is nothing to forgive, which is why Jesus tells us in A Course in Miracles: \"The miracle (forgiveness) does nothing. All it does is to undo. And thus it cancels out the interference to what has been done\" (T-28.I.1:1-3). Forgiveness restores to awareness the power of the mind to choose. In another passage Jesus makes this point again in a slightly different way: \" ... forgive the Son of God for what he did not do\" (T-17.III.1:5). Nothing anyone does has any effect on our peace. Peace is thrown away when the mind decides to side with the ego. The mind then \"forgives\" itself by choosing the Holy Spirit instead. Choosing the ego, which is a choice for nothing, is thus undone/forgiven."

    "text_input": "Q #1081: It is said that without God's wish nothing can move. Everything is God's wish. Thy will be done. Then why give a credit to God for goodness and blame the ego for evil? Is not God beyond that duality?",
    "output": "Yes, God is beyond the duality of good and evil. There are no words that truly define or describe God. Anything that we say about Him comes from the dualistic perspective of the split mind. As Jesus tells us: \"Everything you recognize you identify with externals, something outside itself. You cannot even think of God without a body, or in some form you think you recognize\" (T-18.VIII.1:6-7). The ego thus uses its own descriptive terms for its version of God, but they have nothing to do with God. As a great philosopher once said, \"God made man in his image, and man returned the favor.\" This man-made image incorporates opposing concepts such as good and evil, which are inherent in the ego's thought system. Since the ego's very existence is sustained by opposition and differences, the God it claims as father has to share these characteristics. Most important to the ego's God is the relationship He is imagined to have with His separated Sons. In this relationship we find the source of all the ideas about God's supposed Will for His separated Sons. We learn in the Course that God cannot have a separate Will for separated Sons, since separation from God is impossible (T-6.II.10). Thus, God does not move anything, nor could He possibly have any awareness of the world of form. This would be true even if the world were not made as an attack on Him, which is impossible since the world is made precisely to be perceived as outside the Mind of God. Oneness with His Son is all He knows. That is His Will. A Course in Miracles uses the term \"will\" as a property of spirit, while \"wish\" is an activity of the ego. God's Will, as defined in the Glossary-Index by Kenneth Wapnick, is \"the expression of God's being\" (Glossary-Index, p. 222). In other words, it is Who He is, and it is a Being/Will He shares with His Son. That Will is reflected in the dream in the part of the mind that remembers God (the Holy Spirit): \"The Holy Spirit is the way in which God's Will is done on earth as it is in Heaven. Both Heaven and earth are in you, because the call of both is in your mind\" (T- 5.II.8:4-5). In this passage Jesus gives new meaning to the phrase from the Lord's Prayer: \"Your will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.\" He refers to the split mind that chooses between the ego (earth) and the Holy Spirit (the memory of Heaven). One could say that \"evil\" lies in choosing the ego and goodness in the choice for the Holy Spirit, but the Course would not make that kind of distinction because it tells us we are choosing between the truth and an illusion. Illusion cannot be given reality, or the power of \"evil\" to have effects. It simply is not real. What most distinguishes the Course's teaching about God's Will from traditional Christian belief is that God's Will is not done on earth; He does not know about earth, bodies, separation, or duality. He does not even know goodness because the idea of goodness is made up in contrast to evil. The Course uses the dualistic language and concepts that we understand only to lead us to the oneness we have forgotten. Though it has been forgotten, it has not been extinguished nor changed in any way. No matter how much we believe the madness of the ego we remain one with God's Will: \"Whatever your reactions to the Holy Spirit's Voice may be, whatever voice you choose to listen to, whatever strange thoughts may occur to you, God's Will is done\" (T- 13.XI.5:4). Therein lies our hope and comfort."

Yet I feel deeply conflicted because in creating better habitats I am allowing more plants, animals, bugs, etc., to come into the world and suffer pain, and also inflicting pain on the invader species I remove. I am very confused on the whole issue and I find a lack of explicit guidelines in A Course in Miracles. It is all very well to say the world is a dream; such an argument would allow for all kinds of monstrous evil to be committed to humans, plants, animals, alike. But saying it is not real does not help. The only thing that is real at this very moment is what is actually being experienced, not what would be experienced if it were not for the veil of illusion.",
    "output": "I am not alone in this. The Jain religion takes the practice of not harming anything to extremes. Some Jains wear masks over their faces to avoid inhaling insects, bugs, etc., and lightly brush the road before them to avoid treading on living creatures. I sometimes feel I ought to be doing the same thing, and certainly not inflicting pain on millions of blades of grass with a mower, or injecting rhododendrons with poison to prevent them from spreading and destroying the countryside. Yet do I want to preserve/enhance the countryside when it is a killing field? A: One of the major teachings of the Course is that all Sons are the same, equal in content, not form. And Jesus is not speaking exclusively about homo sapiens when he uses the term Son of God, and so from this perspective he tells us that even the smallest grain of sand is part of the Sonship (T-28.IV.9). Seeing qualitative differences, therefore, means one's mind has merged with the ego. As horrifying as it may be to acknowledge this, if you look carefully, you will see that the entire world is a \"killing field.\" What level does not share somehow in the ego genome of kill or be killed and one or the other? Where is there growth and survival that does not come at another's expense?--root systems; insects; marine life; microorganisms; corporations; governments; defense systems. What can survive without feeding off another? What is there that is needed for our survival that is not also potentially harmful or lethal, to say nothing of limited? Granted, there are examples of stunning beauty, selflessness, and helpfulness. But if you scratch beneath the surface, are not most instances of beauty tinged with pain or vulnerability? Are not most instances of selflessness marked by sacrifice? Are not most forms of helpfulness limited? Given its origin in the ego's vicious and defiant intent to produce an existence totally apart from God's Kingdom of Love and Oneness, how could the world be anything other than this? It was made as an attack (W-pII.3.2:1); and since \"ideas leave not their source\" (e.g., W-pI.132.5:3), it simply replicates the thought that owns it. \"Therefore,\" Jesus teaches, \"seek not to change the world, but choose to change your mind about the world. Perception is a result and not a cause\" (T-21.in.1:7-8). The problem, though, is that we have identified with the ego's version of reality to such an extent that we have no sense of ourselves as minds always deciding to uphold this attack on truth. To protect its system--itself--the ego has us focus entirely on form, believing there is a hierarchy of values and beings, which leads to what Jesus calls \"the first law of chaos\" (T-23.II.2,3). We think that what we perceive is reality. Thus we become obsessed with defending what we judge as good and worthwhile against what we judge as bad or threatening, in the process becoming totally confused and frustrated, as we intuitively sense that the situation is hopeless. And all because we have lost sight of the total picture--that an illusion is an illusion is an illusion. One part of an illusion is no more valuable than any other. Fortunately, there is a solution, and it does not require that you deny what you are seeing and experiencing. Jesus is the loving presence in our minds who helps us get back to the sane part of our minds, where we can recall the steps that led us into this depressing state and then choose to begin the process of healing by looking at everything differently. This means seeing our lives as a classroom and all our relationships and interactions as the curriculum Jesus can use to restore our minds to their natural state of peace and oneness. The world will continue to be what it is, but because our perspective will be different, our perception of it will change. We thus can learn to use our body and the world for this purpose by changing the teacher in our minds from the ego to Jesus or the Holy Spirit. Any role you choose in the world can serve this purpose, and this purpose alone is what would give your life meaning. The thought system in your mind is the problem, not the world. Why would you allow the world--made to conceal your true Identity-- to tell you who you are and what your purpose should be? A Course in Miracles as a spiritual path teaches that there is no way out of conflict and hopelessness unless we are open to the idea that we are choosing what we want to be real in our perception: \"Perception selects, and makes the world you see. It literally picks it out as the mind directs ... Perception is a choice and not a fact. But on this choice depends far more than you may realize as yet. For on the voice you choose to hear, and on the sights you choose to see, depends entirely your whole belief in what you are. Perception is a witness but to this, and never to reality. Yet it can show you the conditions in which awareness of reality is possible, or those where it could never be\" (T-21.V.1:1-2,7-11). This is a radical teaching, without question. It overturns everything we have learned in the world, and it therefore threatens the foundation of our self-concept and our lives. And it seems the only people who are receptive to it are those who have tried other approaches and found them inadequate, or who have thrown up their hands in desperation and have cried out, \"There must be a better way!\" You might wish to read Questions #134 and #340, which also speak to these issues."

    "output": "When the mind chose to identify with the ego thought system, it also chose to forget its identity as mind and identified with the body instead. In doing so it lost all awareness, not only of the memory of God's Love symbolized by Jesus or the Holy Spirit, but of itself as a mind. One of the most important goals of A Course in Miracles, therefore, is to teach us that we have a mind that has the power to choose between the ego and the Holy Spirit. That is the fundamental goal of the mind training curriculum of the workbook. The application of the principles taught in the text and the foundation of the practice of forgiveness is to become aware of the mind that is always choosing between the ego and Jesus' love. The ability to choose is not lost by the mind's decision to forget its power. Lack of awareness does not stop us from choosing; it merely means we are oblivious of the mind's existence, mistakenly believing that the world exists outside the mind and that things external to the mind can have an effect on it. This belief is essential to the ego's thought system and is its mainstay. It finds its clearest expression in the mind's decision to identify with the body. Willingness to accept this identity is no different from willingness to turn to the part of the mind where Jesus' love abides. The question is why it seems easier to believe the ego's lie (the existence of the world and the body) than the Holy Spirit's truth (the existence of the mind and the memory of love/Jesus). The reason is because we want to. What motivates us to want the love that Jesus represents is learning to recognize the painful effects of choosing the ego, by seeing everything in our lives as the reflection of the mind's choice. That is the first step in the process of forgiveness, and it is how we get in touch with the mind that has been forgotten. It means paying attention to every experience of conflict in any form; from a tiny annoyance to murderous rage, and recognizing in it the mind's choice for the ego. The next step is to be willing to accept responsibility for this choice and to remember that the mind can choose differently. This recognition and willingness is how to turn to the Presence of the Holy Spirit in the mind. Awareness of this Presence is thereby strengthened, and belief that the ego is the only way to go is weakened. Jesus himself provides the answer to our quest for him by telling us that only a little willingness to apply the Course lessons is needed. As the symbol of God's Love, Jesus' presence becomes more real with every small step made in the practice of his teaching: \"Our Love awaits us as we go to Him, and walks beside us showing us the way. He fails in nothing. He the End we seek, and He the Means by which we go to Him\" (W-pII.302.2)."

Is it possible that our relationships may not fit neatly into any of the three levels and can be a combination of two possibly? I am so interested in this because a part of me loves the fact that everything is systematic and planned and I feel a need to try to figure this all out. A: Yes, some relationships can span two levels. That would not be uncommon. But in the end this does not matter, because \"each teaching-learning situation is maximal in the sense that each person involved will learn the most that he can from the other person at that time\" (M-3.4:1).

    "text_input": "Q #1085: I have read on your Web site that God does not hear the prayers that we pray here from this illusory world. How can this be true since we are joined to God through our \"right\" mind? Also, as we are just ideas in the mind of God, and ideas leave not their source, how could God not hear them seeing as how we, and everything there is, is in the Mind of God? I understand from reading The Song of Prayer, that our prayers should be around forgiveness and about not making any decisions on our own each day. Does the Holy Spirit, and thus God, in fact, hear our prayers or do they only serve to strengthen our faith in the Holy Spirit and God's plan for our salvation? A: When we (as one Son) fell asleep and left our home in God, we took with us the memory of our true Identity-- that is what is known in A Course in Miracles as our right mind. But since our separating from God is completely illusory, the right mind is as well. We can choose to remember that we are not separate from God, but this has nothing to do with God. God knows nothing of what is not real. The Holy Spirit is spoken of as the \"remaining Communication Link between God and His separated Sons\" (C-6.3:1), but as with the other forms He seems to be for us within the dream--a Voice, a Guide, a Helper, etc.--He is in truth part of the \"eternal formlessness of God\" (C-6.5:8). It is helpful to keep in mind that to get through to us, Jesus must use language that is meaningful to us; but his meaning is not always meant literally. Thus, whenever he is speaking about duality in any sense, his language must be understood metaphorically, not literally. In truth, we exist only in the Mind of God, \"a Oneness joined as One\" (T-25.I.7:1). But in our deluded state we do not think of ourselves as one with God; we think of ourselves as individuals trying to communicate with God Who is separate from us. There is no \"we\" in Heaven:",
    "output": "\"God shares His Fatherhood with you who are His Son, for He makes no distinctions in what is Himself and what is still Himself. What He creates is not apart from Him, and nowhere does the Father end, the Son begin as something separate from Him\" (W-pI.132.12:3-4). In Heaven, therefore, prayer is radically different from what we think it means in this illusory world of separate individuals, where it usually is some form of supplication or entreaty related to our needs. As one with our Source in Heaven, though, \"we\" could have no needs. Jesus thus says: \"The Love They [Father and Son] share is what all prayer will be throughout eternity, when time is done. For such it was before time seemed to be\" (S-1.in.1:7-8). While we still believe we exist as separate individuals, however, Jesus teaches us that prayer will take the form that best suits our needs (S-1.in.2:1). It is a process, with different levels corresponding to where we are on our journey back to our natural state of oneness with each other and with God. But it is always for ourselves (S-1.II.6:1; III.1:1); it is part of our Atonement process. Prayer thus should be centered on forgiveness as much as possible, as it is the experience of forgiveness that leads us to the awareness that we already have what we need: \"Prayer in its earlier forms [asking out of need] is an illusion, because there is no need for a ladder to reach what one has never left. Yet prayer is part of forgiveness as long as forgiveness, itself an illusion, remains unattained. Prayer is tied up with learning until the goal of learning has been reached. And then all things will be transformed together, and returned unblemished into the Mind of God\" (S-1.II.8:3-6)."

    "text_input": "Q #1086: What is the relation between interpretation and judgment? And what is cause and effect in this matter? If the decision-making part of my mind makes the all-important root-cause decision not to be separate, there will no longer be any perception at all; and I'm terrified to make this root-cause decision because it will mean the end of \"me\" as separate existence, right? But who is the \"I\" who is afraid this will be the end of him? Is it the person I think I am, or is it really the decision-making part of mind? Is there really an \"I\" who chose separate existence, or is \"I\" simply an effect of (not existing) separation, an effect who cannot by itself undo the cause? Is \"I\" cause or effect? A: The sense of \"I,\" a personal self, is the effect of the mind's decision-maker choosing the ego. Here is the basis of that conclusion: A major step in the thought-reversal process of A Course in Miracles is our realizing that we are never not a decision-making mind. There is not a self--an \"I\"--and also a decision-making mind. The reason we tend to think they are not the same is part of the problem: denial. It is essential for the continuation of the separation that we not think of ourselves exclusively as minds, or else that we change the meaning of mind so that it is associated only with something physical: the brain. The separation would be in jeopardy if we knew without question that we were minds with the ability to choose to be or not to be separate from God. The strategy to keep the separation intact but disown responsibility for it requires that we think of ourselves as separate, competing selves, not minds sharing the same thought systems and decision-making capacity. As we say again and again, Jesus is addressing only the decision maker. His lessons are geared toward helping us learn to relate to ourselves this way so that we never lose sight of the fact that we are always choosing the ego's way of perceiving or the Holy Spirit's, the ego's purpose for our life or the Holy Spirit's purpose. When we are more consistent in this, we will easily recognize that things are not at all the way they appear to be, and we are not at all who we appear to be. This, then, brings us closer to the end of the journey, our accepting the Atonement and remembering, \"I am one Self, united with my Creator\" (W-pI.95). In the process of getting to this final stage, our fear would gradually diminish, because we would know that we are letting go of something that is false and therefore meaningless: \"The self you made is not the Son of God. Therefore, this self does not exist at all. And anything it seems to do and think means nothing. It is neither bad nor good. It is unreal, and nothing more than that ... [it] is meaningless\" (W-pI.93.5:1-5; 6:6). We would eventually gladly relinquish our hold on this identity, because we would know that it but interferes with our awareness of who we really are: \"Try not to interfere with the Self which God created as you, hiding Its majesty behind the tiny",
    "output": "idols of evil and sinfulness you have made to replace It. Let It come into Its Own. Here you are; This is You. And light and joy and peace abide in you because this is so\" (W-pI.93.9:5-8)."

When you choose against the ego more consistently, you will become more peaceful, kind, and compassionate, which means you will be less judgmental, less guilty and fearful, and have less and less investment in how your life is going in the world--because you would have a growing sense that your life is centered in the mind, not in the world.

    "text_input": "Q #1088: The other day I finally came to understand that we never left our place with God. Now I would like to understand two things. First, why are we here? What happened to cause us to dream up this separation in the first place? Second, if this is all just a vivid dream that we've created, then it seems that nothing really matters. So what of the things of the world? What really matters?",
    "output": "Your questions echo the universal cry of the Sonship: \"why are we here? how did we get here? what are we to do here?\" A Course in Miracles comes in answer to these questions, but not from the same thought system that gave rise to them. The part of the mind that chooses to believe that the separation is real (the ego) asks the questions from within the illusion of separation. The part of the mind that knows the separation never happened (the Holy Spirit) answers the questions from above the battleground of separation. Thus, although Jesus acknowledges our experience in the dream, he does so only to tell us we are not here, but are \"at home in God, dreaming of exile\" (T-10.I.2:1). The explanation we are given in the Course for our seeming existence in the world is that God's Son chose to make up a separate identity to replace the one God gave him, a body to house it and a world in which to \"live.\" We need only consider the myriad ways we assert our individuality and specialness to find the clue to our experience of the world. These assertions follow the ego's law of perception establishing that \"we are here\" because we want to be here: \"You see what you believe is there, and you believe it there because you want it there\" (T-25.III.1:3). Since the mind cannot obliterate the memory of our oneness with God, it must go to great lengths to prove to itself that the separation has occurred. Evidence of this abounds in the belief in the reality of the body and the world, the strong attachment to specialness, and all the ways we defend our individuality. Since God did not (cannot) respond to the Son's request for special favor, the Son takes it upon himself to make and defend his specialness, independent from his Creator. Guilt for this decision drives the Son out of his mind and into the world to hide from the imagined wrath of God Who, according to the ego, seeks His Son to punish him for the terrible sin of separation. Thus, at the core of the dream is the insane belief that separation is indeed accomplished. All the things of this world are the ways by which the mind feverishly defends its choice for separation. Although they are illusory, the belief that they are real makes them real in our experience, and so they must be dealt with. While the ego has brought them forth to make its separation dream real, the Holy Spirit uses them as a classroom to teach us that it is not. It is very important, therefore, that we pay attention to everything in our lives. In fact, becoming mindful is one of the primary goals of the Course and the explicit goal of the workbook. What matters, then, is to learn to recognize all the specific ways in which the mind's choice for separation is revealed in the events and relationships of every day. The greatest defense of the ego thought system is the mind's decision to forget that it is a mind and to identify instead with the body. A correction for this mistaken belief is the most frequently repeated phrase in the Course: \"I am not a body I am free, I am as God created me\" (W-pI.201-220). This is not meant to be used as an affirmation to suppress the belief in the body, but as a reminder of our identity as minds with the power to choose another way of looking at everything. If we are willing to admit that we do not know what the other way is, and allow the Holy Spirit to reinterpret everything for us, what was chosen in defense of the ego's thought system will be used by Him for its undoing. Ultimately the Course answers your questions with its single most important statement: \"...the separation never occurred\" (T-6.II.10:7). Nothing but the mind's choice to identify with the ego thought system of separation got us here, and nothing but the choice to identify once and for all with the Holy Spirit will end the nightmare of believing we are here. Jesus makes this very clear for us in a different way in workbook Lesson 32: \"You are not the victim of the world you see because you invented it. You can give it up as easily as you made it up. You will see it or not see it, as you wish. While you want it you will see it; when you no longer want it, it will not be there for you to see\" (W-pI.32.1:2-5).

    "output": "comes from an ongoing vigilance over our own thinking, recognizing when it is being directed by the wrong teacher--the ego (T-6.V-C.4:2-5; T-7.VI.8:5-11). The challenge of course is recognizing how to apply that understanding to the very real experiences of our lives, for the Course is not intended simply to be an empty academic exercise, but a very practical tool for leading us out of conflict and into peace, in our minds. In other words, Jesus is assuring us that we can be at peace, even if the external situation with a family member does not change. \"In reality you are perfectly unaffected by all expressions of lack of love ... Peace is an attribute in you. You cannot find it outside\" (T-2.I.5:6,8-9). And so we need to practice repeatedly until we overlearn the fundamental correction: No matter how real the conflict with others and within ourselves over any action or inaction may seem, the real cause of the conflict and pain and sense of loss is our continuing identification within our own mind with the belief in sin and guilt--our own and others, with theirs only ever a projection of our own (T-31.III.1,2). It is enough then simply to recognize that we have put the ego in charge whenever we are aware of being upset about anything, and that is the only problem that needs correcting. If in those moments of recognition, we can acknowledge that our choice for the ego is a mistake, but it is no sin, we will not need to punish ourselves but will be willing to accept the gentle help that Jesus always offers first to our own unhappy mind (T-19.III.3,4). Our concern for others at this point in the forgiveness process is simply the ego's convenient smokescreen to keep us in conflict, without recognizing where the conflict is really coming from. Once we choose the right inner teacher, we can respond to the external situation without the interference of our own guilt. But, of course, this takes practice, since our ego is not likely to surrender without a fight. And so ongoing relationships with loved ones like your daughter provide continuing opportunities to practice and learn the basic lesson about what the only real problem is and where it lies. Your daughter is making choices that are self-destructive, but all ego-based choices are self- destructive, even those seemingly intended to protect us and make our bodies safe (e.g., W- pI.135). Now although the Course teaches that we are not our body (e.g., W-pI.199), Jesus also recognizes that the body will continue to be our identity in our experience. And so he never asks us to deny our experience, only our interpretation of it when we have chosen the ego as our teacher. Often the most loving thing we can do when faced with others' insanity is to place limits on them that will prevent them from hurting themselves or others any more than they may have already. The key is to be able to do that without judging, either the other person or ourselves. Now in response to our efforts to place limits, their actions or words, just like a young child's, may scream, \"I hate you.\" But as we are able to release our own guilt to the gentle, forgiving gaze of Jesus, we will not experience the seeming attack personally. For it is only ever our own guilt that leads us to believe that we can be attacked. It is not easy to watch those we love make wrong choices, with what appear to be serious negative consequences for themselves and for those around them. And there are usually limits on just how much influence or control we can exert over those choices. But a helpful lesson we can learn is that this is their chosen classroom, and they will continue down this path until they are ready to make a different choice. And we are never in a position to judge what their path should be. In such circumstances, it can be helpful to remember that the only really meaningful help we can offer anyone else is to remember for ourselves that we always have a choice in our own mind as to which teacher we will turn to for help (M-5.III.1-2). Since minds are joined, this reminder will be received by their mind as well, and it is there, simply waiting on their acceptance, when they are ready and their own fear of love has subsided."

    "text_input": "Q #1090: This question is a variation on the old \"free will\" conundrum. Since God created Christ, he therefore endowed his Son with the capacity to have that first \"tiny, mad idea\" that led to the separation. So, even though the Course lovingly affirms that God has no desire to reject or punish his Son, it still looks like God set up Christ, because how could His Son possibly resist the temptation to find out what it was like to substitute illusion for truth? Why would God create Christ with the ability to make this error, knowing full well that his Son wouldn't be able to resist the temptation?",
    "output": "Your question is also a variation of the frequently asked question: \"How could the separation have happened?\" The question rests on the affirmation that the separation actually occurred, which is the expression of a choice for it. Affirming the separation is the ego's way of establishing its \"reality.\" It is chosen as a substitute for reality, after which the Son of God is off and running with the ego in hand, certain he has pulled off the impossible, convinced that God is chasing him to punish him for his \"sin\" and blaming Him all the while for letting it happen. This is the ego's clever, yet nonetheless illusory version of the \"big bang\" that never happened. The helpful explanation Jesus gives for the non-existent \"big bang\" is that the Son of God has fallen asleep and dreams of separation (T-28.II.7). In this dream, the Son seems to have special powers in the form of a will apart from God's; just as a child at home in his bed dreams he is the son of a king (or more in keeping with the ego's specialness, the king himself) in a far away magic kingdom. In the dream, specialness is preferable to oneness and \"free will\" is the maximum expression of individual power. It is a clever distortion of the power of the mind to choose to accept the one Will the Son shares with the Father. In this light, free will is understood as the ability to make that choice. It is not a choice between two real possibilities, but rather a choice between truth and illusion, everything and nothing. There is no reality but God's, no Will but His, nothing but the mind's power to accept the truth. The part of the mind that chooses against the truth and identifies as a figure in the dream defends its \"reality\" in terms of the conundrum of God making the separation a real and irresistible choice. Only resistance to accepting truth keeps the separation real in our experience, fires the intrigue of asking the unanswerable, and breathes life into the ego's belief in illusion. The way out of this seeming dilemma is learning that, ultimately, the only temptation we cannot resist is that of accepting the Identity given us by God and claiming our rightful place in oneness with Him. We then freely join the one Will we share with our Father: \"And this is the function of God's teachers; to see no will as separate from their own, nor theirs as separate from God's\" (M- 5.III.3:9).

I guess I could simply ignore this problem and have my own thoughts about it; but there is a nagging doubt. To the best  of your knowledge, is A Course in Miracles acceptable for Muslims, or are there simply too many hurdles to overcome?",
    "output": "Anyone, regardless of religious affiliation, can practice this course. Its theology is part of its form, which is specific and differs from other theologies. But that is not the heart of A Course in Miracles, as reflected in this statement: \"A universal theology is impossible, but a universal experience is not only possible but necessary. It is this experience toward which the course is directed\" (C-in.2:5-6). Thus, if you are being helped by the Course on your spiritual journey, it would make sense to continue with it, as the experience toward which the practice is aimed transcends all theological expressions. \"Its central theme is always, 'God's Son is guiltless, and in his innocence is his salvation.' It can be taught by actions or thoughts; in words or soundlessly; in any language or in no language; in any place or time or manner\" (M-1.3:5-6). The idea, therefore, would be to focus on the content not the form; and if there is anything about Christianity that is disturbing to your peace, this would provide an opportunity to look at it and forgive it."

    "text_input": "Q #1092: As a manager of a retail business, I am faced almost daily with confrontational situations with customers. Although I realize that this offers me a lot of opportunities to practice forgiveness, I am having a hard time breaking the bad habit of feeling pressured and insecure when someone is really upset, mad, and being unreasonable. I try not to take it personally, but I can't seem to find the right perspective to resolve the situation and remain calm under stress. I know the problem is all within me. Can you please give a couple of examples of how to apply forgiveness to myself and step back to let the Holy Spirit help me deal with my daily dose of stress? A: You have the right approach--to see the situation as a classroom in which you are learning forgiveness, which means learning not to take the attacks personally. That is not easy to do, as you have discovered, because as egos we thrive on holding others responsible for our lack of peace: \"If this person were more reasonable, I wouldn't feel so insecure and threatened.\" What really is happening is that we make the decision in our mind to turn away from love before the exchange with the other person takes place, and then the guilt over that decision gets projected onto whatever happens to comes along. In other words, we secretly want to be mistreated so that our attention can be focused outward on what someone else is doing to us, rather than on the pain of the guilt within our minds. The cause of feelings of inadequacy and weakness in the face of others' irrational behavior, thus, has nothing to do with those people and their behavior. It has to do with our feeling profoundly and permanently deficient in our relationship with ourselves (self-hatred) because we chose to separate from our loving Creator and then sever all connection with that Love, believing we would do just fine on our own. Therefore, by looking at this self-concept with the love of Jesus next to you, you will be dealing with the true cause of the problems you've been having. The next step would be to accept love's assurance that your self-accusation is unjustified, being founded on false premises. It is impossible to separate from Totality and to reject the Love that encompasses all reality. Thus, your only responsibility is to look at how you have identified with the ego and with guilt, and to realize that all of that is just a mistaken decision. Your innocence has not been lost (W-pI.93).",
    "output": "When your perception is rooted in your innocence or holiness, you will not be affected by your customers, however belligerent they are. You will see right past their ego to the same right mind in which you are now centered. You realize that in your wrong mind you want to be weak and have others mistreat you; then you recognize that the problem is this decision to identify with the ego; then you ask for help to correct that choice; and when you accept the innocence in your right mind as the truth about you, you will remain at peace no matter what other people do or say. \"Let them be as hateful and as vicious as they may, they could have no effect on you unless you failed to recognize it is your dream\" (T-27.VIII.10:6). From that quiet center, which you know everyone shares with you, you will respond in a way that is loving to all involved. You will perceive any weakness in you as simply a defense against this truth, with no power to change it."

    "text_input": "Q #1093: We are repeatedly counseled against specialness, not only in ourselves but in others as well. However, as there are differences in nearly all of us, this makes degrees of conditions: better/worse, smart/not smart, beautiful/ugly, talented/untalented, etc. As long as there are differences to any degree in anything, the contrast points to one's specialness or differences. We can deny spiritual specialness, but what view can be taken with regard to one's differences, many of which are in the extreme? Does anything that we do that shows our differences make us a tool of the ego? Ex: If I write a best-seller book, does this qualify me as special or different and what is the distinction? Are we right to acknowledge this type of difference without the error of being considered special. Therefore, must we avoid exercising any of our positive differences? A: The dream of separation is founded on differences, division, and their mainstay: specialness. The ego's very existence depends on differences, as does the body's. We are not asked to avoid these differences, nor the specialness that is their foundation, but rather to see in them the ego thought system at work. To deny their importance in our lives is to deny the classroom in which to learn the lessons of forgiveness that will eventually undo the belief in differences. As Jesus tells us in the manual: \"Do not despair, then, because of limitations [specialness/differences]. It is your function to escape from them, but not to be without them\" (M-26.4:1-2). We escape from them by going beyond them, which requires that we first see them for what they truly are: projections of the mind's guilt for having chosen separation. Every perception of difference is thus an opportunity to become aware of the judgments that reflect the guilt hidden in the mind. Denying the differences, or trying to be without specialness, buries the guilt deeper and keeps it from awareness. This keeps the mind's choice for the ego from awareness, which also keeps love's presence from awareness. These are the steps in the ego's spiral of denial. The steps for the ego's undoing begin with not denying specialness nor the guilt it engenders, but most importantly in recognizing that the mind has made a purposive choice for the ego and its offspring: specialness and guilt. There are numerous passages in A Course in Miracles where Jesus tells us that denial makes the error of the ego's thought system real, while looking at it without judging it as sinful gradually dispels it. The goal, therefore, is not to be without differences or specialness, nor to fight against them by forcing a false perception of sameness in form. Rather, the goal is to see in every perceived difference the reflection of the mind's choice for the ego. This changes the ego's goal of making differences real and important, to the Holy Spirit's goal of teaching us that we have a mind that chooses. In this way, the differences that were meant to separate become the means to learn that all differences are the same in that they reflect a choice made in the mind.",
    "output": "Whatever form it may take, the ego's content is always separation. The Holy Spirit's content is to take what is different and make it all the same by teaching us that it has the same source (the mind) and the same content (the ego or the Holy Spirit). In this regard it is important to keep in mind the distinction the Course makes between form and content. Everything in our lives reflects the mind's choice for the ego or the Holy Spirit. Special talents can be used by the ego to prove separation and differences, or by the Holy Spirit Who teaches that different talents (form) do not make any difference in our shared Identity as God's one Son. Jesus gives us the right minded use of different talents and abilities: \"The Holy Spirit teaches you to use what the ego has made, to teach the opposite of what the ego has 'learned.' The kind of learning is as irrelevant as is the particular ability that was applied to the learning. All you need do is make the effort to learn, for the Holy Spirit has a unified goal for the effort. If different abilities are applied long enough to one goal, the abilities themselves become unified. This is because they are channelized in one direction, or in one way. Ultimately, then, they all contribute to one result, and by so doing, their similarity rather than their differences is emphasized\" (T-7.IV.3:3-8). Thus, if we choose to learn the sameness of our shared Identity as God's Son while developing and exercising a special talent, it becomes a tool in the hands of the Holy Spirit that will lead to that goal. So, to answer your specific question, by all means write your best seller, just be sure to invite Jesus to be your co-author."

    "text_input": "Q #1094: I am struck by the fact that in studying and practicing A Course in Miracles one can get so overwhelmed by stuff coming up that there is little time, energy, or motivation left to do much else. Life becomes one long drudge of dealing with stuff; there is little time for fun, and it is impossible to earn the money necessary to pay for the therapy needed and sometimes hardly enough even to eat! That has been my experience. My question is whether there is any way out of this kind of Catch 22. The Course seems to be ineffective at supporting one in the process of going through all the stuff. It leaves one hanging in the midst of a mess with no real practical support. A: What you may be forgetting is that you need only look at all the \"stuff\" and not judge yourself for it--you do not have to do anything about it, in the sense of trying to change it: \"Forgiveness ... is still, and quietly does nothing ... It merely looks, and waits, and judges not\" (W-pII.1.4:1,3). The idea is to learn that the only problem is our decision to choose the ego as our teacher rather than the Holy Spirit, a decision we are making in the present, and that therefore can be changed in the present. When your process becomes \"drudge,\" you probably are giving the ego a reality it does not have. It has no power of its own: \"Only your allegiance to it gives the ego any power over you\" (T-4.VI.1:2). Then, too, you probably are forgetting to look at your stuff with Jesus' love beside you. That is where the comfort lies, because he knows it is all made up and has absolutely no effect on his love for you, and that you remain as God created you. Thus, all we have to \"do\" is bring the darkness to his light, where it will simply disappear: \"[Forgiveness] does not countenance illusions, but collects them lightly, with a little laugh, and gently lays them at the feet of truth. And there they disappear entirely\" (W-pI.134.6:2-3). When our \"stuff\" feels too heavy and without end, we are forgetting that, in content, it is all the same stuff, and that, in the end, it is",
    "output": "just a reflection of the \"tiny, mad idea at which the Son of God remembered not to laugh\" (T- 27.VIII.6:2). Even though the ego's thought system can spew forth some rather hideous stuff, it rests on nothing, which, if we realized that, would produce in us only a gentle smile, rather than fear and depression. That is why Jesus encourages us to become \"happy learners\" (T-14.II), for, in the end, we are undoing something that never happened--we just believed it happened. We can indeed proceed with joy, knowing that that terrible burden has been lifted from our shoulders. We need only accept this happy truth by realizing that we have been denying it and no longer wish to do so."

    "text_input": "Q #1095: Is it fair to surmise that since this world and all its ideas, concepts, etc., are all of the ego, so is the idea of a god, a son, creation, etc.--that the author of A Course in Miracles knows this and has used all of our ego ideas to penetrate our thought system, using the Course as a catalyst to bring us beyond everything, even beyond our ability to describe it? A: This is one way of looking at it. What we would tend to revise is the idea that the author of the Course, Jesus, is actively doing something. There are many passages in the Course that say that Jesus and the Holy Spirit use our experiences, concepts, and beliefs to help us undo our mistakes so that our minds may be restored to their original state of oneness. That is part of the ego framework within which the Course remains in order to meet our needs (C-in.3:1). But when you develop a sense of the total picture, you realize that it is we who are opening up to the truth that we have denied; it is we who are realizing that we banished the truth and attempted to replace it with a thought system of our own making and now can see brings more pain than it is worth. We are thus denying our denial of the truth (T-12.II.1:5). Our choosing to become students of Jesus and his course symbolizes our choosing to reverse our journey away from oneness, and examine and then correct the many ways in which we have made separation reality. Jesus is our teacher and guide in this sense, but if we learn his lessons completely, the distinction between him and us would dissolve, because, again, this is a journey back to oneness. Love is an ineffable oneness. Reality is non-dualistic (T-18.VI.1). Chapter 17 in Kenneth's book Absence from Felicity provides a helpful discussion of the different dimensions involved in this crucial issue.  Q #1096 (The following questions were posed by the same person). (i): If God doesn't know about our illusions, why does the Course say, \"God gave to all illusions that were made another purpose ... \" (T-26.VII.15:3)?",
    "output": "Whenever Jesus speaks about God being involved in the illusion, his meaning is not to be taken literally. It is the content of Jesus' message that is important, not its form. (See our answer to #iv below.) He goes to great lengths to re-orient the thinking of those who have come to think of God as judgmental and demanding punishment for our sins. In the passage you quote, what Jesus wants us to know is that although we have used the world and our lives for ego purposes, we can undo all that by turning to our inner Teacher (Jesus or the Holy Spirit) and asking for help to use the world and our lives for His purpose of healing our minds of the belief in separation. That choice of the miracle is always available to us--at every instant in every experience. That is what Jesus is reminding us of in your quoted statement. The emphasis is not on God, but on the shift in purpose that we can make whenever we so choose. Without this alternative purpose, we would be stuck with the ego's version of salvation, which is atonement through sacrifice: our sin of separating from God is real, and now we need to pay Him back for what we did. Jesus is correcting that type of thinking."

    "text_input": "Q #1097: What is love? A Course in Miracles says we can't understand love on this side of the fence and that we must only seek and find all the blocks to love's presence that we have built within us (T-16.IV.6:1). So, what is love? A: The situation is this: Our experience is that we are individuals living in a finite, physical universe. But we experience that as our reality only to the extent that we are (in the present) choosing to be separate from our true Identity in God, Who is Love. How, then, can we understand what Love is if we are choosing not to be part of it? That, in essence, is why our spiritual journey must be centered on identifying and then undoing the blocks we have constructed and are upholding in the present to keep ourselves apart from Love.",
    "output": "Lesson 67 tells us that love created us like itself and that \"if love created you like itself, this Self must be in you. And somewhere in your mind, It is there for you to find\" (W-pI.67.3:2-3). Yet nowhere in that lesson does Jesus define love, but he does talk about our need to undo what we have put in its place. In the very next lesson, Jesus teaches us about the cause of the almost irreparable damage we have done to our minds: grievances. \"You who were created by love like itself can hold no grievances and know your Self ... For he who holds grievances denies he was created by love, and his Creator has become fearful to him in his dream of hate\" (W-pI.68.1:1; 2:4). So if we deny love, which holding grievances does, how can we know love? Yet, how can we fail to know it when we have totally forgiven everyone? This is similar to Jesus telling us that we can never understand the \"concept of a Oneness joined as One\" as long as we think we are separate from one another (T-25.I.7:1). Again in Lesson 127, Jesus helps us realize the consequences of seeing our identity in the context of bodily existence in the world: \"What the world believes was made to hide love's meaning, and to keep it dark and secret. There is not one principle the world upholds but violates the truth of what love is, and what you are as well\" (W-pI.127.5:2-3). It is not difficult to discern from this what we have to do to restore our awareness of love's meaning to our minds; and that is what Jesus spells out for us in this lesson, remarking that \"there is no better use for time than this\" (W-pI.127.7:2). We ourselves (as decision-making minds) are the authors of all the values we find in the world, and our motivation in producing them was to replace what we disowned (our Self). Now we need but reverse that and allow God's gifts to replace what we made (W- pI.127.8:4). Love, then, will be our only experience, because love is the only reality in our minds. In the end, as Jesus states at the beginning, love's meaning cannot be taught or learned because it is what we are. He says he can teach us to remember who we truly are, and adds, \"No course whose purpose is to teach you [this] ... could fail to emphasize that there can never be a difference in what you really are and what love is. Love's meaning is your own, and shared by God Himself. For what you are is what He is\" (W-pI.127.4:1-3). Our lives must therefore be dedicated to uncovering our self-deception and the means we use to sustain that deception. With that undone, love's meaning will blaze in our minds and all questioning simply dissolve into nothingness. Jesus speaks of love and oneness in the same breath, and obviously they are equated, as expressed in this lesson as well as other places: \"As it is one itself, it looks on all as one. Its meaning lies in oneness. And it must elude the mind that thinks of it as partial or in part [that is, as special love]\" (W-pI.127.3:2-3). Love is all-inclusive and extends itself to infinity without limit. Another indication of what our curriculum must be: the undoing of all forms of separation--judgment, special love (exclusion), separate interests--and asking Jesus or the Holy Spirit for help in focusing our lives now on learning to see everyone as sharing the same purpose and the same identity. Of such is the function of forgiveness and the miracle. \"Forgiveness is an earthly form of love, which as it is in Heaven has no form. Yet what is needed here is given here as it is needed. In this form you can fulfill your function even here, although what love will mean to you when formlessness has been restored to you is great still\" (W-pI.186.14:2-4)."

A Course in Miracles says that forgiveness \"merely looks, and waits, and judges not\" (W-pI.1.4:3). That sounds like a definition of choiceless awareness and/or mindfulness. So forgiveness, being in the mode of the observer, choiceless awareness, mindfulness are the same? How does the decision maker fit in? It obviously decides which of the two voices to follow, the ego or the Holy Spirit. When one looks with Jesus is that being the observer or the decision maker? A: In general, you could say that what Krishnamurti and the Buddhists are speaking of is roughly similar to the process the Course talks about. When the decision maker is in its right mind, it is an observer (i.e., looking with Jesus). This is also the state of mindfulness, in that the decision maker is no longer denying its true nature as mind, which it did as part of its plan to preserve its separated state, but not be held responsible for it. Being mind-less (i.e., believing we are bodies) cuts off any possibility of the decision maker reconsidering its original decision to believe it has truly separated from God and now has its own authentic existence. That is why a main objective of the Course is to return us to the state of mindfulness.",

I have come to the realization that I have been a hypocrite all my life and am now experiencing my self in the pit of Dante's inferno.",
    "output": "That could be a positive step, for self-honesty begins to weaken all the barricades we have erected to block the truth. The way out is to realize that \"the pit of Dante's inferno\" is also part of the hypocrisy of maintaining that you are not as God created you. You have helped yourself by distinguishing between self and Self. Now you must accept that only one is your true reality, the other made up. And it's not hard to guess which is true and which false, especially if you are a student of A Course in Miracles. What you have to emphasize is that only one is real. Jesus talks about this very movingly in Lesson 93: \"You are what God created or what you made. One Self is true; the other is not there. Try to experience the unity of your one Self. Try to appreciate Its Holiness and the love from which It was created. Try not to interfere with the Self which God created as you, by hiding its majesty behind the tiny idols of evil and sinfulness you have made to replace It. Let It come into Its Own. Here you are; This is You. And light and joy and peace abide in you because this is so\" (W- pI.93.9). You perhaps hate yourself as a decision-making mind for choosing to be other than this Self God created in the image of His own Holiness and Love. The projection of self-hatred usually lands on God's doorstep! But when you realize that this mistaken choice had no effect (except in your own deluded mind), and it has not changed your true Self, there is nothing to upset over. To be upset and self-condemning implies that the mistake is not simply a mistake that has already been corrected, but rather is a sin that has had a real effect. But this is what we are constantly advised not to do: make the error real. That it is difficult to get past the horrendous self-image we harbor within has not escaped Jesus' attention: \"These are beliefs so firmly fixed that it is difficult to help you see that they are based on nothing\" (W-pI.93.2:1). Suppose Dante had realized that sin has no foundation in reality? Interestingly, Jesus uses the word arrogance in reference to our negativity toward ourselves. To cite one example, in Lesson 152, which also stresses the unchangeableness of our Identity, he instructs us: \"We lay aside the arrogance which says that we are sinners, guilty and afraid, ashamed of what we are; and lift our hearts in true humility instead to Him Who has created us immaculate, like to Himself in power and in love\" (W-pI.152.9:4). In conclusion, it is helpful to look squarely at whatever self-hatred and resentment may be present, but only so that you can bring into the light of forgiveness what you have denied and kept in darkness. Forgiveness means accepting that what you thought you made to replace God's creation is totally illusory and will fade into meaninglessness when you no longer have a need to see it as real. \"Father, Your Holiness is mine. Your Love created me, and made my sinlessness forever part of You. I have no guilt or sin in me, for there is none in You\" (W-pII.235.2). These are the happy thoughts of those who have walked the path, not with Virgil into the Inferno aflame with sin, but with Jesus into the light and peace of forgiveness, aflame with love."

    "text_input": "Q #1100: Kenneth says in the audio series \"Learning from the Holy Spirit\" that \"as long as you're in physical pain, there is no know way you're going to get quiet in your mind.\" But isn't the physical or mental pain what we need to bring to the Holy Spirit? Isn't that saying that there is a hierarchy of miracles? If we can only experience peace when there is no pain how are we ever going to rid ourselves of it? That's like saying that someone could keep us away from the peace of God by inflicting physical pain on us. I would think that even if someone is in pain that that would be the doorway to release. A: From one point of view, you are correct. A Course in Miracles comes on two levels: one of absolute truth, and one of right-mindedness and wrong-mindedness within the illusion. From Level One:",
    "output": "\"If you have the gift of everything, can loss be real? Can pain be part of peace, or grief of joy? Can fear and sickness enter in a mind where love and perfect holiness abide? Truth must be all- inclusive, if it be the truth at all. Accept no opposites and no exceptions, for to do so is to contradict the truth entirely\" (W-pI.152.2:3-7). Echoing this in the workbook, Jesus tells us, \"Pain is illusion; joy, reality. Pain is but sleep; joy is awakening. Pain is deception; joy alone is truth\" (W-pI.190.10:4-6). On this level, then, pain and peace are mutually exclusive states. Level Two refers to the teaching in the Course that addresses us who believe the world and bodies are real (we are real). On this level, we are taught that the Holy Spirit can use anything we (as decision-making minds) made to keep our separation from God intact, to help us reverse our direction and walk the path of forgiveness back to God (T-25.VI.4:1-2). Since we believe our experiences as individuals are real, Jesus meets us there, but only so that he can teach us that we have chosen the wrong teacher and that the consequences have been horrendous. Once we see that, and realize we can choose differently, then our experiences take on a whole new meaning and purpose. In this sense, on this level, pain can be seen as part of the curriculum in our classroom, and that we can use it to learn the ego's lessons or Jesus' lessons, depending on which one we have chosen as our teacher. If Jesus is our teacher, we can learn that the inner peace that is our inheritance as God's creation is forever unaffected by anything of the world or the body. This corrects the world's thinking that peace of mind is dependent on external circumstances and conditions: I can't be peaceful as long as my child is in danger, or my spouse is ill, or I have nowhere to live because my house was destroyed, etc. So, yes, you bring your pain to Jesus or the Holy Spirit, but for the purpose of seeing it differently, which means learning that your true Self remains unaffected by bodily states, even when the pain is mental or emotional. This is a very difficult lesson for us, because the ego made pain to banish awareness of our true Identity, as we are taught in \"Sickness is a defense against the truth\" (W-pI.136.7). It is true that you can peaceful while you are in pain. This is the approach of the Stoicism, both ancient and modern--a kind of acceptance or resignation that this is the reality for you right now. But that is not the peace of God spoken of by Jesus in this course. The miracle always entails shifting from body awareness to mind awareness, realizing that all experiences flow from the mind's decision to identify either with the ego thought system or the Holy Spirit's thought system. Identifying with the Holy Spirit's thought system leads ultimately to the undoing of the cause of all pain. Peace alone remains."

    "output": "You perhaps are referring to the experience described in the section in the manual called, \"Can God Be Reached Directly?\" (M-26), where Jesus talks about those who have reached the top of the ladder and no longer have any ego. These are the \"Teachers of teachers,\" or those in the real world. Although there are many ways of reaching that egoless state, the means offered in A Course in Miracles is the practice of forgiveness. Forgiveness is thus the path to certainty: \"Do you want happiness, a quiet mind, a certainty of purpose, and a sense of worth and beauty that transcends the world? ... All this forgiveness offers you and more\" (W-pI.122.1:4; 2:1). As you generalize forgiveness so that no area or relationship in your life remains untouched by it, your experience of who you are and who everyone else is must change. Forgiveness orients you away from specialness and separation and toward all-inclusiveness and oneness. This sparks the return to your awareness of \"your intense and burning love of God, and His for you\" (T-13.III.2:8). In the section in the text called \"The Forgiven World,\" Jesus speaks in glowing terms of what we will experience in the real world, \"attained simply by the complete forgiveness of the old, the world you see without forgiveness ... Forgiveness literally transforms vision, and lets you see the real world reaching quietly and gently across chaos, removing all illusions that had twisted your perception and fixed it on the past ... From the forgiven world the Son of God is lifted easily into his home. And there he knows that he has always rested there in peace\" (T-17.II.5:1; 6:2; 7:1-2)."

It sounds foolish, but if I were ever to return home, I would think I would never make that mistake again, but how can I return to where I never left? God, according to A Course in Miracles, is not aware of our separation in metaphoric terms; but is He aware of our choice to separate in response to the mad idea? A: If you accept the strict metaphysical non-dualism of the Course, you would have to conclude that God could not be aware of our response to the tiny, mad idea of separation. If He were aware of it, that would mean there are two opposing real states: God and a state apart from Him. That puts you right into dualism, the prevailing view of reality in the world's theologies and philosophies, but not that of A Course in Miracles.",
    "output": "Within the illusion, the tiny, mad idea is always present, and we are always responding to it in one of two ways: either by remembering to smile gently at it (the Holy Spirit's response [T- 27.VIII.9]), or by taking it seriously (the ego's response) and then living out the consequent defenses of denial and projection. That we have done the ego's bidding in this way is behind Jesus' pointed description of our lives: \"Each day, and every minute in each day, and every instant that each minute holds, you but relive the single instant when the time of terror took the place of love. And so you die each day to live again, until you cross the gap between the past and the present, which is not a gap at all. Such is each life; a seeming interval from birth to death and on to life again, a repetition of an instant gone by long ago that cannot be relived. And all of time is but the mad belief that what is over is still here and now\" (T-26.V.13:1). This parallels his earlier description: \"Each day, each hour and minute, even each second, you are deciding between the crucifixion and the resurrection; between the ego and the Holy Spirit. The ego is the choice for guilt; the Holy Spirit the choice for guiltlessness. The power of decision is all that is yours. What you can decide between is fixed, because there are no alternatives except truth and illusion\" (T-14.III.4:1- 4). These passages make it clear that we can correct our mistaken choice at any instant of any day in our lives. To make that choice without reservation is our return home (with a brief stop in the real world, of course). Therefore, our only focus should be the present instant and the choice we are making in that instant. Our release from illusions lies only there. By concentrating your attention there, the questions about what will happen later will eventually fade away entirely in the realization that the tiny, mad idea never happened, and so it can never be chosen again."

    "text_input": "Q #1103: If it only takes one mind to see the truth, to see another's needs as important/more important than one's own to heal the entire Sonship, why isn't Jesus' obvious success in this area enough to bring us all home? He speaks of himself as our older brother, yet the fact that his success didn't heal the Sonship seems to say that he is not truly--that only someone who is among the illusory \"separated\" must be the one who sees himself as healed to initiate the Atonement.",
    "output": "The Sonship is healed. In fact, healing was never truly needed. In the workbook Jesus clarifies this for us: \"Just as forgiveness overlooks all sins that never were accomplished, healing but removes illusions that have not occurred\" (W-pI.137.5:2). Healing is thus understood as a process of removing the blocks to the awareness of what has never changed (T-in.1:7). It is the acceptance of what is true and the denial of what is not. Since everyone has a right mind where the reflection of changeless truth abides, and Jesus is a symbol of the right mind, his healing is everyone's. Healing simply means choosing the right mind. Choosing against the right mind by choosing the ego does not void the truth, nor abolish the memory of love's presence; it merely draws a veil over them. The veil is lifted and healing is accepted by the mind's choice that it be so; that is all. Thus, Jesus didn't really do anything, nor could he. He is neither a success nor a failure. A Course in Miracles does not view time linearly, and nor does it teach the accomplishment of a historical Jesus who attained salvation and redeemed the world, as does Christianity. He is the name given to a symbolic figure who represents the right mind of the Sonship. He has what we all have. As he himself tells us the only difference between us is that he has nothing else: \"There is nothing about me that you cannot attain. I have nothing that does not come from God. The difference between us now is that I have nothing else. This leaves me in a state which is only potential in you\" (T-1.II.3:10-13). What we have that blocks healing from awareness is the belief that illusion is true. The desire that some form of specialness replace the oneness the Son shares with the Father keeps the insanity of the ego thought system alive and \"sick.\" Jesus seems like a failure as long as the mind chooses to turn away from the sanity of truth, while healing occurs when the mind decides to accept, even partially, that what it sees in the nightmare of separation is not true. In that instant the mind shares in Jesus' healing. Jesus gives us a very simple description of the state of mind we share with him whenever we choose to: \"How simple is salvation [healing]! All it says is what was never true is not true now, and never will be. The impossible has not occurred, and can have no effects. And that is all\" (T- 31.I.1:1-4). The only \"one\" needed to see everything in the light of this true perspective is oneself. That is why it only takes one teacher of God to heal the world (M-12). We take a step closer to the healing we share with Jesus each time we are willing to question the ego's interpretation of any situation (to prove separation is real) and accept the Holy Spirit's perspective (separation is not real). One is true, the other false. It is for us to choose."

    "text_input": "Q #1104: I am wondering about Lesson 71 in the workbook of A Course in Miracles: \"Only God's plan for salvation will work.\" In the process of asking the three questions: \"What would You have me do? Where would You have me go? What would You have me say, and to whom?\" (W-pI.71.9:3-5), I was carried along not to any actions, but to many places in the past where I  felt the presence of the Holy Spirit, along with one place in particular where the tension of life circumstances produced a dramatic \"pendulum\" between feeling panicked and then totally at peace. Is there a \"right\" answer to these questions? Should I be getting specific actions about my life now? I wonder about this, especially since Kenneth talks so much about Jesus not being invested in what happens in our lives, that the change is in the mind. I do know the remembrances and the spirit they compelled were beyond my normal daily concerns.",
    "output": "In this lesson, Jesus teaches that the mind chooses either God's plan or the ego's, which is then reflected in form by what we do, where we go, what we say and to whom. You are correct that Jesus is not concerned with form, but with the content of the mind. However, because our focus is usually on form, he uses a word formula related to behavior to be used as a reminder for us to turn our attention from the form to the mind, where we choose whose plan we will follow. Since that is Jesus' only concern, that is the purpose for the prayer he teaches in this lesson. An experience such as you describe is the effect of the mind's choice for the Holy Spirit (God's plan) instead of the ego. Jesus tells us: \"Everyone has experienced what he would call a sense of being transported beyond himself\" (T-18.VI.11:1). In other words, everyone has accessed the right mind. What distinguishes the Course's teaching about how to arrive at these right-minded experiences is that it asks us to be willing to look at the ego's obstacles by paying attention to the thoughts and expectations that interfere with God's plan. Basically, that is everything we think. An important line in the tenth paragraph of the lesson tells us: \"Be alert to all temptation to hold grievances today...\" (W-pI.71.10:2). The key to the practice of this lesson is found in the words: \"Be alert.\" The repetitions are not meant to be used as mantras to suppress grievances, but as reminders to look at them without judgment and without trying to change them. This, along with willingness to accept a different perspective, weakens belief in the ego's plan of keeping salvation from awareness with its best friends denial and guilt. Only God's plan, (choosing the Holy Spirit) will work because only truth is true, and only in accepting the true Identity God has given us as His Son will we find the happiness we seek. We learn to accept His plan by uncovering the ego's well established beliefs about where salvation can be found. Its version of what to say, or do and where to go supports separation and belief in the identity of the body. Remembering to ask God to reveal His plan in every situation is the Holy Spirit's way of inviting us to recognize the choice we have already made with the ego, and to make another choice. Until the ego's plan has been exposed and released, it cannot be replaced by the content of the right mind (God's plan). Thus, there are no specific answers to these questions. The mind's choice for the Holy Spirit instead of the ego is reflected in the dream in whatever form is loving and helpful, with no planning or thinking on our part. All that is required is \"to seek and find all of the barriers within yourself that you have built against it [love/God's plan]\" (T-16.IV.6:1). We then await with patience and gratitude the moments when the Holy Spirit's loving kindness guides our words and actions."

    "text_input": "Q #1105: What does it mean to say that mind is the \"activating agent of spirit, supplying its creative energy\" (C-1.1:1)? And how does this fit with \"spirit retains the potential for creating, but its Will, which is God's, seems to be imprisoned while the mind is not unified\" (C-1.4:2)? Is consciousness the opposite of the mind that is \"the activating agent of spirit,\" consciousness being \"the receptive mechanism, receiving messages from above or below, from the Holy Spirit or the ego\" (C-1.7:3)? Is consciousness another term for the observer or decision maker?",
    "output": "In the first section of the clarification of terms to which you refer, Jesus is somewhat inconsistent in his use of words, as he alluded to in the Introduction. He uses words here slightly differently from how he uses them in the Course itself, thus teaching us to pay attention to the content (his message), not the form (the words). In describing mind as the \"activating agent of spirit\" (C-1.1:1), Jesus implies a difference between the two terms. This, of course, is not so in Heaven, where we are spirit and mind, the two being synonymous. To get a sense of Jesus' meaning here, think of a fountain: the mind is the engine that drives the fountain, and spirit is the water that flows through it. Still, these are but symbols for something beyond comprehension in our separated state. Usually in A Course in Miracles, but not exclusively, when the word mind is lowercase, it refers to the split mind, but when it is capitalized, it always refers to the Mind of God or the Mind of Christ, which is the equivalent of spirit. Spirit, in this first paragraph, is our true Self, the unified spirit being God's one Son. In the next paragraph Jesus uses spirit differently--as a synonym for the right mind, and ego for the wrong mind: \"It [the split mind] is therefore described in the course as if it has two parts; spirit and ego\" (C-1.2:4). This interchange of meanings illustrates the folly of attempting to analyze the precise meanings of these words and terms. Thus at the end of the first paragraph, Jesus speaks of the unified spirit, which is Christ, and here--and only here in this section-- spirit is equated with the right mind. This is seen again in the third paragraph: \"Spirit is the part that is still in contact with God through the Holy Spirit, Who abides in this part [the right mind] but sees the other part [the wrong mind] as well\" (C-1.3:1). It would be more technically correct to say that the reflection or memory of spirit is in the right mind. \"Spirit retains the potential for creating, but its Will, which is God's, seems to be imprisoned while the mind is not unified\" (C-1.4:2). Since true spirit is always creating, Jesus is again referring to the right mind, because he speaks of spirit having the potential for creating. Our mind has this potential while we sleep, for we are not in touch with the Mind's power to create. The key word in the second part of the sentence is seems. It seems that our true Self as spirit is imprisoned. In reality, nothing has happened. Some of these points have been discussed in #65, where you will also find some commentary on consciousness. Consciousness is entirely of the illusory world of separation, for it always entails duality or a split: the perceiver and what is perceived. It is a function of the mind that resulted when the separation from God seemed to have happened. It would not be wrong to think of consciousness as the observer or decision maker."

    "text_input": "Q #1106: I started smoking pot and experimenting with LSD at eleven years of age. The first couple times I had the most spiritual experience of oneness. But the next time was pure hell. I had the worst bad trip, which opened a doorway in my mind I wish I had never seen. My ultimate fear was that I would remain in that fearful, panic state for eternity with no escape. It seemed very real and powerful at the time. Later, in my late teens, I developed panic attacks and anxiety, leading me to search for an answer, which I found in A Course in Miracles.  I still have concerns that I did some damage to my brain from the drugs, which caused my nervous system to give my body physical effects of fear, even though I knew it was false in my mind. Does the mind override the brain on all levels of experience while we are in a body or can we do damage to our brain and nervous system that will limit us, even though we know its just part of our grand illusion?",
    "output": "The only thing that can ever limit us in any way is our beliefs, which are the thoughts we hold about ourselves in our minds (T-26.VII.8:7-10). Much of the time these beliefs are unconscious and so it appears that there is little we can do to change them (W-pI.138.8). But, and we can't emphasize this enough, the body, the brain, and the nervous system are all the effects of the thoughts in the mind and can never be the cause of anything we experience. It is the ego that is invested in our becoming mindless, and seeking causes for how we feel in the world of form outside the mind. Yet all forms are nothing more than projected symbols that represent the choices we have made in our minds, now hidden by our own choice from our awareness. How does this translate specifically into the experiences you report? The drugs initially gave form to a desire you had to remember the truth about yourself and so they seemed to precipitate an experience of oneness. The mind, still strongly identified with the ego, became fearful, and so the subsequent effect--the bad trip--simply was a defense you chose against remembering the truth about yourself. Like everything else in the world of form, the drugs are really neutral and your experience depends on which teacher you have chosen to interpret your experiences for you--the Holy Spirit or the ego. In an effort to assure that the detour into fear remains permanent, the ego reinforces the fear with the further fear that there can be no escape from the fear. And then, to put the final nail in the coffin that will lock you away from the light and into the ego's thought system forever, the ego tries to convince you that the fear you have experienced is not the result of your choice, but rather the secondary effect of irreversible damage that the external agents have inflicted on your brain and your nervous system. The ego is brilliant but insane, and we are just as insane when we choose to listen to it. But there is always another Teacher available to us within our minds, when we wish to learn something other than separation and guilt and fear. And it is by becoming increasingly conscious of what we have chosen with the ego that another door opens to a different choice. This process is beautifully described in one of the lessons in the workbook: \"Heaven is chosen consciously. The choice cannot be made until alternatives are accurately seen and understood. All that is veiled in shadows must be raised to understanding, to be judged again, this time with Heaven's help. And all mistakes in judgment that the mind had made before are open to correction, as the truth dismisses them as causeless. Now are they without effects. They cannot be concealed, because their nothingness is recognized\" (W-pI.138.9)."

    "text_input": "Q #1107: I decided to give this problem to the Holy Spirit and ask it once here, then let it go. I have been going to school to be a radiologic technician for a couple years now and will be finished sometime in 2007. During chemistry class I cheated on an exam because of the overwhelming work load I took on. Since then I sometimes have these scenes of death and physical pain and hurt in my mind that I will cause because I wonder if I happened to miss something very important on that test--something that is detrimental to someone's health. I feel like others will be punished for my laziness. The thought comes to me that maybe I should take the class over so I can learn what I missed and then I am quickly filled with fear. I think what I missed will never come back around and has forever passed me by. When I offer this to the Holy Spirit I hear a voice that tells me, \"Sure, now you're at peace but look at this pain you will cause. Do you care about their peace?\" Another similar thought accuses me of hurting people in different ways. For example, I stretched the truth to get my job and I sometimes feel like I stole the job from people who are more deserving of it. I think I have hurt them, which must be atoned for, maybe by giving up my job. Can you give me some insight from the perspective of A Course in Miracles on this fear?",
    "output": "Before you let your thoughts go and give them to the Holy Spirit, there is one more thing that would be very helpful to do first. And that is to ask yourself what purpose both your acts of dishonesty and all your conflicting thoughts about them are serving for you. For they are not simply careless acts or random thoughts, nor are the thoughts about your deceptions thrust upon you against your will--you in fact invite them all in for a reason. Your specific actions and your subsequent acute conflict are all part of the ego's relentless attempt to keep you mindless, that is, obsessively focused on shadow problems and guilt so that you never get in touch with what is behind them --the guilt in the mind that is the source of their projection. These situations with their future fears are symbols for the deeper self-accusation that you won't allow yourself to look at, that we all share--that we are responsible for pain and death because of our choice against God and for the ego, a choice, by the way, that we continue to make, minute by minute, each day of our lives (T-14.III.4:1-2), until we ask for another way. For we unconsciously believe we cheated God out of the life that is rightfully His and now masquerade as our own creator, while down deep we know the whole thing is one big lie, that we are a fraud and something is missing for which we are responsible. And so, while these thoughts are not conscious, they color our interpretation of all our experiences in the world with feelings of guilt and inadequacy for which no real solution seems possible. And if we then act out in ways that seem to reinforce that negative self-perception, all the better, for those violations seem to be the reason we feel as we do and we think we need look no further to understand why we feel so guilty. And that guilt can never be undone, for what is done is done, with the potentially destructive consequences irreversibly set in motion. Yet the good news is that there is an answer, but not in terms of fixing things in the world, such as atoning through sacrifice for our wrongdoing. Those actions merely reinforce the underlying thought that our guilt is real. It is not that there is something that needs to be done, but rather something that needs to be undone--our belief that our underlying guilt is real and calls for punishment. Now we will not be able to change our minds about ourselves by ourselves--to us it is all quite serious, certainly nothing to smile about. And so we need to turn to Jesus or the Holy Spirit and ask to join with them in their perception of the truth about us. For they see beyond the clouds of guilt we have made real to the light of holiness that shines always within our minds (T- 18.IX.8-9). And they will help us learn that we can neither harm nor be harmed (M-4.IV.1:1.2). And then you will begin to smile at the reasons you have felt the need to protect yourself through dishonesty and deceit, and you will begin to see the silliness of all your thoughts of attack and hurt, because you will begin to understand that all your mistakes have had no real effect on anything that truly matters."

That is why the statement \"I need do nothing\" is so difficult for me. I continue to wonder if I will \"get it,\" whatever that is, in this lifetime. There is no time; it's an illusion. But while I have accepted the atonement principle, I don't know that I really have internalized it. What happens if I don't \"get it\" in this lifetime? The problem is that all of the work I do in this lifetime will be \"lost\" and I'll have to start all over again, even though I know I'm not a separated body, and am one with the Son of God; in fact I am the Son of God. The more I study, the more I get confused; I know there is a great deal of level confusion here. I guess I might just have to accept that \"I need do nothing\" and know that it is all alright and that my mind is with God, but it would sure help if you'd tell me this.",
    "output": "Indeed, you need do nothing, it is all right, and your mind is with God. And definitely nothing is lost. Knowing that in our state of deep confusion we are beset with fears and doubts, Jesus offers the reassurance you seek: \"There is no time, no place, no state where God is absent. There is nothing to be feared\" (T-29.I.1:1-2). The only thing keeping this realization from awareness is resistance. Resistance cannot be fought against; it can only be acknowledged, and the only thing \"to do\" is to use your natural affinity for getting things accomplished to be vigilant. You can accomplish mindfulness, and willingness to see that confusion is only fear of truly accepting the Atonement. Just as you would not push someone who is afraid of drowning out of a boat, it is not helpful to try to push yourself into Heaven. Besides, it will not work. An understanding of the Course's teaching about the illusion of time and the separation is helpful in learning the metaphysical foundation of its thought system, but until we are ready to experience these truths, it is best to practice A Course in Miracles in the classroom of the body and our lives. While we believe in the reality of the world, it is important that we \"stay with it,\" so to speak. It holds all the lessons needed for the practice of forgiveness. Everything within the illusion of time is useful to the Holy Spirit, including a type-A personality. And every step toward the goal of returning to the home we never left, taken in this lifetime or any other, gets us closer to the end we seek. Again, nothing is lost. Certainly there have been learning experiences in this lifetime (and perhaps many others) that led you to the Course. How can you know what preparatory steps paved the way. In fact, Jesus tells us in this regard: \"...you cannot distinguish between advance and retreat. Some of your greatest advances you have judged as failures, and some of your deepest retreats you have evaluated as success\" (T-18.V.1:5-6). The only way out of confusion is to stay with what we actually experience, not what we know intellectually. The thoughts that present themselves moment by moment are our guide to the activity of the mind. They reveal the choice the mind has made and the beliefs that support that choice. No conflict presents itself when the mind chooses the Holy Spirit. Anything but perfect peace tells us the ego has been chosen; misery, conflict, and confusion are then inevitable. No big deal, another choice can be made. When you find yourself getting on the merry-go-round, switching levels, it may be helpful to practice an exercise found in the text: \"This lesson takes no time. For what is time without a past and future? It has taken time to misguide you so completely, but it takes no time at all to be what you are. Begin to practice the Holy Spirit's use of time as a teaching aid to happiness and peace. Take this very instant, now, and think of it as all there is of time. Nothing can reach you here out of the past, and it is here that you are completely absolved, completely free and wholly without condemnation. From this holy instant wherein holiness was born again you will go forth in time without fear, and with no sense of change with time\" (T-15.I.9). In the Course, Jesus assures us that no small effort, no willingness however little, no tiny step toward truth are lost. Each one weakens our grip on the ego's thought system, and each strengthens our hold on his hand. We cannot lose, and you cannot help but \"get it.\""

Is that true? Are people in my life characters who are always enacting the script I wrote for them? Or are they acting in accordance to their own script and when they need a \"scapegoat\" will anyone who is at hand at that specific moment, which may or may not be me, be used as such?",
    "output": "The secret, forgotten agreement (T-28.VI.4) is never between the figures in the dream--the selves we think we are--but occurs at the level of mind, usually out of awareness, between the fragments that believe they are separate dreamers. And so as the dreamer of my dream, yes, I am responsible for everything that seems to happen to the figure that I identify as myself within the dream (T-27.VIII.10). But that is not a level that most of us are in touch with, nor is it a particularly helpful way to approach our daily experiences and interactions. The more helpful level to consider, while I still identify with the figure I call myself, is that I am responsible for my interpretations and reactions to the various events in my life. Now there is some truth in your observation that, when we are looking to project our guilt, any convenient target will do. But no one can truly be a victim of anyone else's seeming attack. It is only ever my own interpretation that leads me to see someone else as attacking me and, in particular, depriving me of my peace (T-12.I.3). No matter what the other person may be saying or doing, it is my own choice whether to take those actions personally and, if I do, it can only be because I want to see myself as a victim. And that always reflects the secret agreement (see #37 for further discussion of this hidden agreement) to seem to be hurt by the other. In union with the ego, we have all agreed to see others as responsible for our unhappiness and feelings of victimization. And we all have special partners in which the dance of death has been especially intimately choreographed. Yet when we are willing to dismiss the ego and turn to a different Interpreter of our experiences, we will recognize our own buried guilt in all of our reactions to what others seem to be doing to us. And with that recognition, we can make a choice about continuing to hold on to that guilt or letting it dissolve in the gentle light of true forgiveness. And that always entails forgiving ourselves for our own projections of our own guilt, at which point we can only see others' words and actions as the calls for help and love that they truly are (T-12.I.3-4)."

Thus, the \"sphere of celestial order\" refers to the realm beyond the physical realm, where the laws of spirit have nothing in common with the laws of the ego world. The same would be true of the \"Divine Order.\" While we still adhere to the ego thought system, the realm of God and Heaven is completely unknowable by us. The law of love's eternal, non- quantitative extension is meaningless to us while we are enmeshed in the specialness of individual existence."

    "text_input": "Q #1111: Two questions on sickness: A Course in Miracles talks about giving our body the Holy Spirit's purpose and then it should function healthily. The past couple of years I've had a lot of sickness, which I attribute to stress and my two little rugrats bringing home what I like to call \"the voodoo toddler virus\"--only because I had put the Course on the back burner in my mind for a number of years, but now I'm back on track. To what extent does limiting guilt and practicing forgiveness affect our immune system; and are we limited more or less as long as we remain in a body?  The section in the manual called \"How Are Healing and the Atonement Related?\" (M-22) states that healing, the Atonement principle, and forgiveness are not just related, but are identical, and that this must be understood if the teacher of God is to make progress. I know that the body is the illusion and trying to heal the body is trying to make the dream and the body real. If the goal is to accept the Atonement, and having received it, my mind is healed, does it not follow that the body would then be subject to the decision that the mind has made and be healed too? Or can the mind be healed and the body still appear to be sick? How does this work if I am working with someone else who is sick? Does his body still appear to be sick or be healed?",
    "output": "(The following covers both questions.) The Course stresses that the body is a projection of the mind and does not exist as an independent entity that gets sick, gets better, and eventually dies (T-28.VI.2). Thus, only the mind is active--the body has no effect on the mind, and to think that it does is what Jesus calls level confusion (T-2.IV.2). The guilt in our minds is always projected onto our own bodies (sickness) or onto others (attack), unless the decision maker chooses to look at the guilt with Jesus. This is all part of the ego's strategy to get us out of our minds so that we will never realize that we have the power to choose against it (the ego). We thus wind up believing the body actively does things or is acted upon by outside agents, over which we have little or no control. But that is all made up (self-deception), which is why Jesus describes sickness as \"a defense against the truth\" (W-pI.136). Ill health is the effect of a decision made by the mind for a purpose it wants to fulfill--ultimately, to remain in its separated state but not be held responsible for it. Thus does Jesus teach, \"The cause of pain is separation, not the body, which is only its effect\" (T-28.III.5:1). Pain, therefore, is not defined by bodily sensations; our experience of pain is due entirely to the guilt in our mind and our choosing the ego's interpretation that we deserve to be punished. Forgiveness is the mind's decision to look at guilt with Jesus, learning that it is based on false beliefs and therefore need not be projected, but simply let go of. Although still a projection of the mind, the body, then, will not be used in support of separation and guilt, but rather to demonstrate the Holy Spirit's thought system of shared interests. The mind healed of its belief in guilt will know that the body is not its reality, and so \"health\" will now be associated with the acceptance of the Atonement, not mistakenly with the absence of disease; and the immune system will be properly located in the mind--the mind's resistance to any belief in the reality of separation and limitation. No longer identified with the body, the healed mind will not be limited by it (T-18.VI.13), although the body will still appear \"normal\" in the sense of aging and other kinds of conditions. An ego-free mind could also choose to help unhealed minds learn that the body is not their reality by appearing in a diseased body or in a body that gets crucified. Consider Ramakrishna or Jesus for example: their bodies at the end did not appear very healthy in the world's terms; yet there was no guilt in their minds. They chose to teach us through those forms. There could also be other reasons, unknown to us, for choosing bodily limitations; but the healed mind would not add on the ego's interpretation, that they are the punishment for our sinfulness. Thus, the observation of the body alone cannot tell us whether a specific condition represents a right-minded or wrong-minded decision. Strictly speaking, of course, if a specific condition is the direct effect of the mind's projection of its guilt, then that condition will change when the mind lets go of the guilt. But with the disappearance of guilt goes also the mind's identification with the body, as the mind has realized that its state of peace is completely independent of the body's condition. That is crucial, and a very difficult lesson for us to learn. In contrast, for the mind that still values separation and specialness, the body will symbolize whatever that mind values and wants to hold on to. Addressing the decision maker in this context, Jesus says, \" you have made of it [the body] a symbol for the limitations that you want your mind to have and see and keep\" (T-28.VI.3:10). Consequently, we (as decision making minds) will experience ourselves as limited by the body only if that is the identity we want to be the truth about ourselves. We will become what we are not, which includes believing the body runs on its own systems, which are affected by outside forces. It is far more helpful to focus on the mind's immune system: the power to accept the truth that we have been denying, and to deny that anything external can give us peace or take it away. (Kenneth presented a workshop in 2005 entitled \"Strengthening the Mind's Immune System.\") Jesus reminds us, however, that \"the resistance to recognizing this is enormous, because the existence of the world as you perceive it depends on the body being the decision maker\" (M- 5.II.1:7). So we need to be patient with ourselves as we process these teachings and learn how to smile gently at our need to have the body be real in our awareness. If you are working with someone who is sick, your only responsibility is to be aware of your perceptions and to look for any judgments you may be making, and then to bring them to the love of Jesus that is always present in your mind. As Jesus states in an earlier section in the manual, where he is discussing how to be with a patient, \"This is the function of God's teachers; to see no will as separate from their own, nor theirs as separate from God's\" (M-5.III.3:9). That is always the guiding principle for any relationship--to perceive your interests as shared with the other person's, not as separate. Then you will simply know what to do or not to do. Whether the other person is coming from the wrong mind or the right mind will be irrelevant; your response will always be loving. Again, you cannot judge the content of the person's mind just from the condition of the body (form). But in that holy instant of being beyond separate interests, love will flow through you in a form that will be appropriate in that situation. You will then avoid the all- too-common mistake (often with hurtful results) of thinking you know what is in that person's interests; and, respectful of that mind's choice, you will have no ego needs that will disrupt the communication of love."

    "text_input": "Q #1112: I know it is imperative to think of the Holy Spirit (or Jesus) as a real person who loves you. And this seems to be in keeping with the language of the Course. On the other hand, with certain rare exceptions, this does not come naturally to me, and we are also taught that the Holy Spirit, and God are really metaphors for oneness. I also find the language confusing because by defining the Holy Spirit as a person it would seem to increase the sense of duality (self vs. not- self) rather than eliminate it. Why can't the Holy Spirit be thought of as higher inspiration, as unconditional love, or as understanding that comes to one when one is receptive, through any means that is useful and natural to one? By insisting that He be a person, I often find myself put off because I think: I don't believe in this, the Holy Spirit isn't a person. I agree it is very comforting and very powerful to feel Jesus' presence. But that is a rare experience for me. I put the Course down for weeks.",
    "output": "Perceiving Jesus or the Holy Spirit as a person is meant as a helpful way to make their presence real to us. We are deeply attached to our identity as bodies; not only physical bodies but emotional, psychological, and intellectual bodies, wherein our thoughts, imaginings, fantasies, and beliefs take on great importance. We know that Jesus and the Holy Spirit are not persons. We know that loved ones who have died no longer have the bodies they wore when they lived amongst us. That does not deter us from remembering them as they were to us. In fact, we keep pictures of them to remember the love we shared with them. The pictures are symbols, Jesus and the Holy Spirit as persons are symbols. Indeed, we are not bodies, and Jesus is not speaking to the individual who identifies with a body. In addressing the mind of the Sonship, the Course uses symbols (words and images) to accommodate our mistaken belief about ourselves. It refers to the Holy Spirit as \"He\" (a person) Who symbolizes the part of the mind that holds the memory of God's Love. Jesus refers to himself as a person: \"I will teach with you and live with you if you will think with me ... \" (T-4.I.6:3). He even invites us to see him as a body: \"If it helps you, think of me holding your hand and leading you. And I assure you this will be no idle fantasy\" (W-pI.70.9:3-4). The only important thing is that we take Jesus' invitation to heart in whatever form is most meaningful: \"Let my relationship to you be real to you, and let me bring reality to your perception of your brothers\" (T-17.III.10:2). As always in practicing the Course, we look at everything we experience as the reflection of the mind's choice for the ego or the memory of love (Holy Spirit). Every annoyance, confusion, or irritation can only come from the choice to listen to the ego thought system. In resistance to its message, everyone puts the book down for periods of time. It doesn't matter whether it be for a few minutes, weeks or years. What matters is picking it up again, which reflects the mind's decision to listen to the Holy Spirit. If only for an instant, if only once in a great while, you experience Jesus' presence, it is enough to tell you he is there. That is all we need to know, for love has come, having been chosen by the mind that remembers."

I have heard other Course people say it doesn't necessarily mean that, but having looked quite carefully through the text it sure does sound like that is exactly what Jesus does mean. And since so much seems to depend on this holy relationship, it makes me feel like I am not qualified to work with A Course in Miracles because I have no significant other.",
    "output": "Our answer to #223 provides a helpful overview of the issue of special learning partners in our work with the Course. In general, we all have people in our lives who push our buttons in a major way, and these encounters can be helpful in directing us to some deeply buried guilt, which we can then look at and ask for help with. Special love and special hate relationships are always rooted in the guilt we buried and projected in an effort to get rid of it. They are defined only by this choice to accept the ego's interpretation of our guilt, not by the way bodies interact. That is another critical point raised in our discussion. Relationships exist only in the mind (content) and are not between bodies in the world (form), as we commonly tend to think (see T- 28.IV.3). A holy relationship automatically flows from our choice to have the Holy Spirit be our Guide for seeing everything, which means all of our thoughts and perceptions will reflect the oneness of the Sonship in some way--we will see our interests as shared with everyone else's, not as separate and conflicting. Thus, you do not have to make something happen or fix something with another person in your life for you to experience a holy relationship. The only relationship is the one that exists in your mind between you and the Holy Spirit, which can then be symbolized in a relationship with another person, meaning that the relationship now serves the Holy Spirit's purpose rather than the ego's. But you do not have to be in a close relationship with someone for this to happen. It is always a matter of whether you are making the ego's thought system real in your mind or the Holy Spirit's. Everything else will symbolize that choice. When A Course in Miracles originally came, Jesus was speaking to Helen about her relationship with Bill Thetford and other significant people in her life. And so there are many statements about \"you and your brother.\" Yet he also emphasizes that \"you can interact but with yourself\" (T-31.V.15:5), and that \"there is nothing outside you\" (T-18.VI.1:1). \"You and your brother,\" thus, are symbols or concepts in our minds--that is what Jesus is trying to get us to see. Yes, that certainly is an advanced level of awareness, but if we lose sight of that central truth, we will not be able to practice this course as it was intended to be practiced, and we will wind up bringing Jesus down to our level (the ego's most cherished goal), instead of rising to his level, where our minds would be restored to their natural state of eternal love and peace."

    "output": "\"Ideas leave not their source\" (T-26.VII.4:7) is the cornerstone of the Course's teaching. Upon it rests every other principle of its thought system. This most basic law of the nature of the mind means that nothing exists outside the Mind of God, and therefore the separation is impossible. Likewise, nothing exists outside the mind of the Sonship, and therefore the world is an illusion. The world and the body are projections of the mind; they do not exist in reality. We perceive and experience them as real because we choose to believe in them as the expression in form of the mind's choice for separation. It is the mind's belief in them that \"makes them.\" That is what the Course means when it says we made them; or more specifically \"made them up\": \"What if you recognized this world is an hallucination? What if you really understood you made it up? What if you realized that those who seem to walk about in it, to sin and die, attack and murder and destroy themselves, are wholly unreal? Could you have faith in what you see, if you accepted this? And would you see it?\" (T-20.VIII.7:3-7). The key to understanding the principles and teachings of A Course in Miracles is to remember that it addresses the mind of the Sonship, not the individual who identifies with a body. Everything always refers to the mind precisely because \"ideas leave not their source.\" The \"us\" that the Course refers to as created by God is the Mind of His Son who remains one with Him in the home he never left. God did not create the individuals we think we are. The mind that is split by belief in separation has confused itself with the body. The goal of the Course is to heal this identity confusion by teaching us that we are minds with the power to choose. The healing is accomplished through the practice of forgiveness whereby every experience is seen as a projection of the mind. Thus, the principle that \"ideas leave not their source\" is made real in our experience, undoing the belief that something can exist outside the mind. In this way, the mind chooses to accept its true Identity (what God created), and weakens its belief in the hallucinatory experience of the world and the body (what the split mind made)."

    "text_input": "Q #1115: Some time ago, I slowly came to agree with the answer given in #767 dated 07/20/2005.  However, there hasn't been any current \"filling in the gap\" or \"holy instants\" of joy, happiness, or anything of a positive nature to make an alternative route from the worldly ego to notice. The result seems to be a blah passing of life without any enthusiastic interest in anything through an acceptance of ACIM ideas. How can one take any joy in the illusive and the unreal? One could feel \"guilty\" for having not fulfilled the promises made in the texts, or at least disappointed, and surely feeling like we're just treading water until, at last we leave the body, at the least. So what is a ACIM believer to do while here in the body? The idea that some time there will be an atonement is great but how does one feel good about ourselves while we could still be in our bodies for the next 20 or 30 years, or more? And \"horrors\" we could come back to more ego illusions!!! After 16 years or reading, it feels like a labyrinth which has no exit, and that the promises are but more illusions. Is there ever some light somewhere in this tunnel which I have been traveling these many years?",
    "output": "Since the Course's teaching turns our usual way of thinking upside down, we should perhaps begin by turning your image upside down. The world is the tunnel, and the light both in the tunnel and at its end is the message of the Course. For you, and countless other students, it does not always seem this way. That is because, as the old song goes, we are so accustomed to \"looking for love [light] in all the wrong places.\" If at any time you have felt a deep resonance and calm certainty in recognition that the message of the Course is true, you have accessed your right mind, and that is the holy instant. It is no more glamorous than that, yet hardly insignificant: \"A light has entered the darkness. It may be a single light, but that is enough\" (M- 1.1:4-5). Eons of lies are undone in an instant of recognizing that truth is true. Appreciation of any small, but truly effective step in the accomplishment of the Atonement is the only source of hope in journeying with the Course. The ego works in grand strokes, roaring and shrieking, but it lies. The still, small Voice of the Holy Spirit whispers, but speaks the truth; It speaks for God. Using the body as an instrument for learning to listen to that Voice, with the world as a classroom, would seem a worthy use for them during the next 20 or 30 years. No doubt the beliefs you previously held about God, your self and the world have been extinguished, or at least mortally wounded during your many years of Course study. Their demise is no small accomplishment, considering the investment in learning the erroneous concepts. If such change is possible in learning the principles of the Course, it is reasonable to believe that everything else it promises is also within reach. Advances toward the fulfillment of its promises are frequently obscured by the interference of expectations that have nothing to do with the goal of the Course. We do not always want what it promises, wanting instead, fanciful substitutions for true spiritual progress. That is why Jesus tells us: \"Some of your greatest advances you have judged as failures, and some of your deepest retreats you have evaluated as success\" (T-18.V.1:6). In other words, we don't know what's going on, and would be incapable of evaluating it even if we did. And so, in his gentle wisdom he adds: \"Put yourself not in charge of this, for you cannot distinguish between advance and retreat\" (T-18.V.1:5). Taken to heart, this inevitably leads to some sense of relief. We do not have to know what's going on. If 16 years seems like a long time, it may be comforting to know that in an instant of truly doing nothing by not judging, we \"slip past centuries of effort, and escape from time\" (T-18.VII.7:3). This is the light we find in the tunnel of the ego's insanity when we are willing not to put ourselves in charge of the Atonement. It not only lights our way, but lightens our load."

    "text_input": "Q #1116: In the answer to #771, you say, \"Jesus did not need to forgive those who crucified his body because he was not identified with his body.\" In bodies we need to learn to forgive others. The Jesus who appears in the Bible makes the most important quote of his entire career by saying, \"Forgive them for they know not what they do.\" If he had no need to extend forgiveness to those who attacked his body, then why did he ask for those who had attacked his body to be forgiven? If one claims that this Jesus in his petition for forgiveness in the Bible has nothing to do with the Jesus in A Course in Miracles, then we have completely thrown out the baby with the bath water.  While it is easy to recognize the insanity of this world, one can but wonder at the lack of consistency in conflicting statements made throughout the entire texts. If they were in error or mere figures of speech, the distinction is not usually or clearly drawn for the reader. How can inconsistency be consistent with truth? If a thing is true it must always be true.",
    "output": "Ah yes, it can all become so very confusing when we try to understand who really said what when, or when we aren't clear how to differentiate between what is meant literally and what is meant metaphorically in a writing such as the Course, which is much more like a poem than a scientific treatise. Perhaps the simplest way to respond to your query would be this. The content of the message of the figure we call Jesus who lived two thousand years ago is the same as the content of the message of the Jesus who speaks to us now from outside time and space through the Course. The forms no doubt are different, for a variety of reasons, including differences in the psychological sophistication of the times then and now. However, it is a completely separate question as to whether Jesus' followers, especially those who attempted to put his good news down in writing two thousand years ago, truly understood his message of love and forgiveness. From the Course's perspective, if we accept its words as coming from the same source as the Jesus who appeared two thousand years ago in Palestine, the accuracy of the New Testament and its gospels as reports on Jesus' words and teachings is debatable. Jesus' followers' recollections of his message, or what they heard second and third hand from others (ever played the game of \"telephone\"?), were no doubt distorted by the projections of their own egos. Jesus comments very explicitly on these distortions in the text: \"The message of the crucifixion is perfectly clear: Teach only love, for that is what you are. \"If you interpret the crucifixion in any other way, you are using it as a weapon for assault rather than as the call for peace for which it was intended. The Apostles often misunderstood it, and for the same reason that anyone misunderstands it. Their own imperfect love made them vulnerable to projection, and out of their own fear they spoke of the \"wrath of God\" as His retaliatory weapon. Nor could they speak of the crucifixion entirely without anger, because their sense of guilt had made them angry. \"These are some of the examples of upside-down thinking in the New Testament, although its gospel is really only the message of love. If the Apostles had not felt guilty, they never could have quoted me as saying, 'I come not to bring peace but a sword.' This is clearly the opposite of everything I taught. Nor could they have described my reactions to Judas as they did, if they had really understood me. I could not have said, 'Betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?' unless I believed in betrayal. The whole message of the crucifixion was simply that I did not. The 'punishment' I was said to have called forth upon Judas was a similar mistake. Judas was my brother and a Son of God, as much a part of the Sonship as myself. Was it likely that I would condemn him when I was ready to demonstrate that condemnation is impossible? \"As you read the teachings of the Apostles, remember that I told them myself that there was much they would understand later, because they were not wholly ready to follow me at the time.\" (T-6.I.13-16:1) So you're going to make yourself crazy if you attempt to reconcile the teachings of the Course with what Jesus' followers two thousand years ago wrote about what they thought he had said and taught and done. The statement you repeat above as attributed to Jesus by the gospel writers at his crucifixion, if taken literally, would undermine the whole foundation upon which the Course's teachings on forgiveness rest. If Jesus had believed there was anything to forgive, he would have been making sin real and his request to the Father would be what Jesus in \"The Song of Prayer\" pamphlet refers to as forgiveness-to-destroy (S-2.I,II). Jesus in the Course does provide an alternative interpretation of this gospel statement that clearly provides a correction for its original intent: \"Miracle-minded forgiveness is only correction. It has no element of judgment at all. The statement 'Father forgive them for they know not what they do' in no way evaluates what they do. It is an appeal to God to heal their minds. There is no reference to the outcome of the error. That does not matter\" (T-2.V.A.16). Now if you feel more drawn to the stories and quotations attributed to Jesus in the New Testament than to his words in the Course, then perhaps the Course is not your path. You are the only one who can decide that. But if the Course is your path, you'll want to stay focused on its content and not get lost in the ego's hairsplitting over discrepancies and contradictions. Jesus emphasizes this near the end of the Course: \"This is not a course in philosophical speculation, nor is it concerned with precise terminology. It is concerned only with Atonement, or the correction of perception ... \"All terms are potentially controversial, and those who seek controversy will find it. Yet those who seek clarification will find it as well. They must, however, be willing to overlook controversy, recognizing that it is a defense against truth in the form of a delaying maneuver ... A universal experience is not only possible but necessary. It is this experience toward which the course is directed. Here alone consistency becomes possible because here alone uncertainty ends. \"This course remains within the ego framework, where it is needed ... Therefore it uses words, which are symbolic, and cannot express what lies beyond symbols ... The course is simple ... It has one function [forgiveness] and one goal [peace]. Only in that does it remain wholly consistent because only that can be consistent.\" (C-in.1:1-2; 2:1-7; 3:1,3,8-10) Finally, in response to your concluding comment: A thing, including the Course, as well as the Bible, can never be true. The content underlying the words can reflect the truth, but the words themselves are not the truth. Teachings can only point to the truth, which is beyond all words and symbols. For further discussion on the nature of the Course's use of symbols, The Message of A Course in Miracles, Part II: Few Choose to Listen, as well as the audio set, Duality as Metaphor, can be especially helpful."

    "text_input": "Q #1117: You mentioned in an earlier answer that recalling the past was a defense against the truth. I know from reading A Course in Miracles that sickness is also one of these defenses. Can you give a list of other common defenses?",
    "output": "Since the guilt that arises as the result of the mind's choice for separation is projected on to the body, everything pertaining to the body is a defense against the truth because it was made as a substitute for the oneness that was abandoned when separation was chosen. A list of defenses contains everything we choose to use to defend and protect belief in separation. It is a long list indeed. Anything that proves the world \"real\" in our experience defends the mind's belief in it, thereby denying the truth of oneness. This is the mind's way of dissociating from itself in its attempt to remain separate from its Source. The truth, however, is that there is no defense against the truth; it can be denied, forgotten, blocked from awareness, but it cannot be changed or extinguished. We read on the first page of the text: \"Nothing real [truth] can be threatened. Nothing unreal exists\" (T-in.2.3; boldface omitted). It follows that the illusory existence of what is not real (ego/ world) requires constant defense in order for the mind to sustain belief in it by its choice. Thus, the entire made-up physical universe is a defense. Obviously we cannot undo the belief in separation by crossing defenses off our list. However, we learn in the Course that everything made as a defense against the truth can be used by the Holy Spirit to lead to the truth. Through the process of forgiveness, the entire defense strategy of the ego is transformed into a classroom for learning to accept the truth. The body and the world lose their power to defend against the truth when they are seen as projections of the mind. Willingness to apply this important principle in any situation strengthens belief in the power of the mind and weakens the ego's defense arsenal. There is no need to fight against the defenses. They need only be recognized as a smokescreen used by the ego to keep truth from awareness. They reflect the mind's choice to identify with the ego and to forget that it ever made a choice. One of the important goals of the Course is to uncover the ego's deceptive scheme and expose its defenses so the mind can choose to correct the error of believing in separation and accept its true identity as mind. Anything outside of the mind that is perceived as having any positive or negative effect on the mind's perfect peace is a defense against it and therefore against the truth. It constitutes a denial of the part of the mind that holds the memory of God's Love and abides in perfect peace. Being willing to see the ego's defense strategy at work in every relationship is the beginning of its undoing by the mere fact that it has been exposed. Not justifying the mind's projections lessens their effectiveness as defenses; not defending the defenses weakens them. Through this gentle practice, the ego's grip is loosened and eventually undone. The defense list fades and is erased."

What the world is, is but a fact. You cannot choose what this should be. But you can choose how you would see it ...

That is why you must realize that your hatred is in your mind and not outside it before you can get rid of it; and why you must get rid of it before you can perceive the world as it really is\" (T-12.III.7:9-10).  \"The world as you perceive it cannot have been created by the Father, for the world is not as you see it\" (T-11.VII.1:1).  \"Now is the question different. It is no longer, 'Can peace be possible in this world?' but instead, 'Is it not impossible that peace be absent here?'\" (M-11.4:11-12).  \"To perceive anew is merely to perceive again, implying that before, or in the interval between, you were not perceiving at all. What, then, is the world that awaits your perception when you see it?\" (T-11.VII.1:5-6).  \"The world the holy see is beautiful because they see their innocence in it\" (T-20.III.6:3).  \"This loveliness is not a fantasy. It is the real world, bright and clean and new, with everything sparkling under the open sun\" (T-17.II.2:1-2).  \"The altar of God where Christ abideth is there. You have defiled the altar, but not the world ... Bring your perceptions of the world to this altar, for it is the altar to truth. There you will see your vision changed, and there you will learn to see truly. From this place, where God and His Son dwell in peace and where you are welcome, you will look out in peace and behold the world truly\" (T-12.III.10:3-8).",
    "output": "Although there is certainly much in A Course in Miracles that would seem to say otherwise, the Course's foundational metaphysical principles, if truly understood, make it very clear that God is abstract and not personal. For example, early in the text, in a discussion about how the ego arose, Jesus makes the following observation about knowledge, which is a term the Course uses to refer to our perfectly unified reality in God, or Heaven, in contrast to the realm of perception, which is the ego's invention: \"Abstract thought applies to knowledge because knowledge is completely impersonal, and examples [i.e., specifics] are irrelevant to its understanding. Perception, however, is always specific, and therefore quite concrete\" (T-4.II.1:4- 5; italics added). The personal--and interpersonal--can only arise out of a thought of separation, where there can seem to be a specific self and a separate specific other--an observer and an observed. \"Ego illusions are quite specific, although the mind is naturally abstract. Part of the mind becomes concrete, however, when it splits. The concrete part believes in the ego, because the ego depends on the concrete. The ego is the part of the mind that believes your existence is defined by separation\" (T-4.VII.1:2-5; italics added). The Course identifies both consciousness and perception as the result of the thought of separation. \"Consciousness, the level of perception, was the first split introduced into the mind after the separation, making the mind a perceiver rather than a creator. Consciousness is correctly identified as the domain of the ego\" (T-3.IV.2:1-2). Clearly then, consciousness and perception cannot be states or abilities of the true God as the Course characterizes God. The oneness that is our reality, as the Course repeats in many different ways across many, many passages, simply cannot recognize separation nor the resulting illusory specifics and differences. Nor can the mind that has made separation real remember and understand its true, nonspecific, unified nature. \"Complete abstraction is the natural condition of the mind. But part of it is now unnatural. It does not look on everything as one. It sees instead but fragments of the whole, for only thus could it invent the partial world you see ... One brother is all brothers. Every mind contains all minds, for every mind is one. Such is the truth. Yet do these thoughts make clear the meaning of creation? Do these words bring perfect clarity with them to you? What can they seem to be but empty sounds; pretty, perhaps, correct in sentiment, yet fundamentally not understood nor understandable. The mind that taught itself to think specifically can no longer grasp abstraction in the sense that it is all-encompassing\" (W-pI.161.2:1-4; 4:1-7). So God does not know we are here, that is, He does not perceive that we are here, because the knowledge inherent in God as perfect Oneness is impersonal, nonspecific, and non-perceptual. If there could be any sense in which God knew that we are here, He would have to be a separate, personal God, capable of perceiving us as separate from Him, and we would in fact have to be separate from Him--all contradictions of the Course's basic teachings on the nature of God and reality. So, as a matter of clarification, even referring to God as He or Him, as the Course does throughout, confers a Personhood upon Him that can only be a fiction. If all of this is true, the question remains, why is so much of the Course, such as the passages you cite, written in a way that seems to suggest that the separation is real, that God exists apart from us, as a Person Who perceives His children as existing independent of Him in a world that can be perceived outside Him and that He seems to care about? Why is the Course presented this way, if the words contradict what the Course is saying about the nature of our reality and God's-- perfect oneness? This question has been addressed both briefly and in depth across a number of answers on this service (e.g., Questions #27, #42, #72, #85, #156, #157, #228, #506, #550, #681, #754, #761, #773, #890, #921, #958, #967). But let us examine it once again, perhaps pulling everything together in a little different way. Invested as we are in believing that we are creatures of separation, we only understand duality. Everything in our experience reinforces our belief in separation and so simply to be told it is all illusion--that the world, and the selves we believe we are, are not real, so get over it!--would not be particularly helpful. Rather we need a teaching that addresses us where we believe we are, for with our self-imposed, finite split minds, we cannot comprehend infinite oneness. And in fact, if the infinite, impersonal Oneness that the Course refers to as God had been the Course's primary emphasis, it would most likely arouse more fear and anxiety in our minds than it already does now, as we begin to grasp, when we are ready, its deeper implications. We first need to be taught that our experience of separation and duality is based on belief and not fact so that we can begin to question the validity of all our interpretations of our experience and allow our investment in them to be undone. In particular, all of our interpretations that lead us to conclude that we or others are victims of persons and events outside our control need to be reconsidered. The Course's approach to teaching this is a powerful demonstration of one of the Course's major emphases--that what needs to change is not the dualistic form of the illusion we believe in but the purpose we give it. For duality is not the problem in itself. The problem is our belief in it and, in particular, the purpose for which we have been using it--to keep ourselves believing we are sinful and guilty and consequently beyond gentle correction and genuine healing. So the first step is not to deny or negate duality, but to give it a different purpose--to begin to use the symbols of separation to undo our belief in separation. And that is what the Course does. This approach is brilliantly demonstrated in the Course's use of Christian terms and symbolism for a different purpose from that given to them by traditional Christianity. To understand the Course's correction, we first must understand what we have chosen to believe about this made- up dualistic God and our relationship with Him. For accepting the separation as real, we have also accepted an incredible dualistic myth about God as Someone separate from us Who wants to punish us because of our sin against Him in choosing to turn against His Love and reject the paradise He has made for us. All of us who believe we are here in the world must believe we have really accomplished the separation, thereby victimizing this otherwise all-powerful God. And so He must seek revenge, beginning by banishing us from the paradise He conditionally gave us. Incorporated into this myth of separation and sin are overwhelming feelings of guilt and fear, which keep us from seeing clearly what we have foolishly chosen to believe. Christianity represents a vivid demonstration of the ego's separation-based religion that accepts sin and victimhood as real and presents the only resolution, called God's plan, as requiring the brutal murder of His only Son. Specifically, God's plan calls for His pure and innocent Son to take on a body so that he can be tortured and killed as a sacrifice, in order to compensate or atone for our evil, victimizing thoughts and deeds against God, and appease His otherwise boundless wrath. Why God can only be satisfied by a sacrificial death is never explained but simply accepted as the truth. Over and over again, traditional Christianity emphasizes that our sins have been washed away by the Son's redeeming blood. Bizarre as it may sound when presented without any additional context, there is little doubt that Christianity's basic tenets continue to hold sway over many minds in the Western world. Its far-reaching appeal lies in the fact that it reinforces the underlying ego thought system, upon which our personal identities and the existence of the world depend. And it has the added appeal of saying that God is a separate Individual Who acknowledges and reacts to separation and sin, conferring a sacred legitimacy on the entire ego enterprise. The Course comes as a correction for these strange beliefs, using the same dualistic forms, speaking symbolically of God as a separate individual Person--our Father--while addressing our belief that we have attacked Him through our desire for separation. The correction remains within a dualistic framework while our fear of oneness and the loss of self is too powerful, assuring us that our Father only loves us, that we can only seem to attack God, ourselves and each other in our feverish imagination, and that the world we have made is simply an outpicturing of our own foolishly misguided and mistaken thoughts of separation and sin and guilt. If we allow His Holy Spirit to correct our misperceptions, we will begin to experience the world in a completely different light, while we continue to believe the world is separate from us and real. And we will begin to recognize that all of our experiences represent a choice we have made in our own minds about how we want to feel. In the end, when all of our ego perceptions of attack and blame will have been corrected, we will know that the external world, as well as the self we have believed we are, is not real. This healed perception is what the Course calls the real world, a state of mind in which all sin and guilt have been undone. It is the transitional state, still within the ego-derived perceptual realm, that precedes the return to knowledge/God/Heaven. There are many passages that make it clear that the real world is still an illusion and therefore not real, despite its name. We will conclude with a number of passages that should offer a correction for any strictly dualistic interpretation of the passages that you have cited, and should also make it abundantly clear that the Course's dualistic language is only metaphorical and is not to be taken literally. \"He [the Son] always perceives this world as outside himself, for this is crucial to his adjustment. He does not realize that he makes this world, for there is no world outside of him. If only the loving thoughts of God's Son are the world's reality, the real world must be in his mind\" (T- 12.III.6:6-7; 7:1). \"The real world is the second part of the hallucination time and death are real, and have existence that can be perceived\" (T-26.V.12:3). \"The real world still is but a dream. Except the figures have been changed. They are not seen as idols which betray\" (T-29.IX.7:1-3). \"The real world is the state of mind in which the only purpose of the world is seen to be forgiveness\" (T-30.V.1:1). \"Wrong-mindedness listens to the ego and makes illusions; perceiving sin and justifying anger, and seeing guilt, disease and death as real. Both this world and the real world are illusions because right-mindedness merely overlooks, or forgives, what never happened. Therefore it is not the One-mindedness of the Christ Mind, Whose Will is One with God's\" (C-1.6). \"There is a borderland of thought that stands between this world and Heaven. It is not a place, and when you reach it is apart from time ... We have referred to it as the real world. And yet there is a contradiction here, in that the words imply a limited reality, a partial truth, a segment of the universe made true. This is because knowledge makes no attack upon perception. They are brought together, and only one continues past the gate where oneness is\" (T-26.III.2:1-2; 3:2-5). \"Perception will be meaningless when it has been perfected, for everything that has been used for learning will have no function. Nothing will ever change; no shifts nor shadings, no differences, no variations that made perception possible will still occur. The perception of the real world will be so short that you will barely have time to thank God for it. For God will take the last step swiftly, when you have reached the real world and have been made ready for Him. The real world is attained simply by the complete forgiveness of the old, the world you see without forgiveness\" (T-17.II.4:2-5; 5:1). \"This course will lead to knowledge, but knowledge itself is still beyond the scope of our curriculum ... We need remember only that whoever attains the real world, beyond which learning cannot go, will go beyond it, but in a different way\" (T-18.IX.11:1,3). \"For as Heaven and earth become one, even the real world will vanish from your sight. The end of the world is not its destruction, but its translation into Heaven. The reinterpretation of the world is the transfer of all perception to knowledge\" (T-11.VIII.1:7-9)."

    "text_input": "Q #1120: Jesus says in Psychotherapy: Purpose and Practice that the process of giving up our guilt cannot be done \"without some pain\" and that the merciful nature of this letting go may be followed by a \"deep retreat into fear, etc.\" I have recently gotten over a big mountain on my path and work with the Course and definitely experienced what Jesus describes in those passages. But why do we have to go through this? Is there any way around this painful process? I am motivated to keep going by the holy instants that I achieve, but I get scared of the process even though I intellectually know that it is going to work. Is there any way around this whole process? I don't know how much more I can take. Can I make a deal with my ego to leave me alone? A: Making a deal with the ego is what got us into trouble in the first place. Furthermore, it didn't work. The ego told us it would leave us alone if we would just stay out of our minds and seek for peace and happiness in its promised land--the world. According to this plan, the body would meet all our needs. As it turns out, the deal caused the guilt as well as the painful process of giving it up. The only way out is calling off all deals and deciding to stick with the alternative Jesus teaches in A Course in Miracles: forgiveness.",
    "output": "What makes the process of forgiveness painful is resistance. In fact, we could restate the phrase you quote from the Psychotherapy pamphlet to read: giving up guilt cannot be done \"without some resistance,\" which is a mild understatement. Since the body is the home of guilt, the mind that identifies with the body will find it very painful to undo guilt because it thinks it will be undone. The practice of forgiveness rests on the fact that the mind, not the body, is the decision maker, and, as Jesus tells us in the manual: \"The resistance to recognizing this is enormous [and therefore painful], because the existence of the world as you perceive it depends on the body being the decision maker\" (M-5.II.1:7). Clearly we cannot avoid pain/resistance since its source is the mind that continues to choose to identify with the package deal of ego, body, and guilt. In case that is not enough, the ego throws another trap into the bargain by telling us that deciding for God is fearful and will somehow cause pain. The mind now finds itself between a rock and a hard place and inevitably becomes dazed by this dilemma, just as with the body-identity dilemma described in the text (T-4.V.4). The pain and confusion of the ego's trap work splendidly to achieve its goal of making the Atonement seem unattainable. Mission accomplished. The kind and gentle advice Jesus gives us with regard to resistance in \"Rules for Decision\" applies to all resistance: \"Do not fight yourself\" (T-30.I.1:7). Trying to starve out the ego or keep it at bay does not work because it has been invited in and has made itself at home. In fact, it now thinks it is master of the house, and the mind, having forgotten its decision to invite in this stranger in the first place, has subjected itself to its rule. To further exacerbate the insanity of this arrangement, the mind decides that what threatens the ego's rule is painful, while happiness is found in preserving its saga of sin, guilt and fear through specialness. Thus, duped by the world's \"painful pleasures and ... tragic joys\" (W-pI.131.7:1), we no longer know what is good for us and are completely confused about joy and pain. True relief is found only when the mind strikes a \"new deal\" with itself by accepting its identity as a mind with the power to choose: \"It alone decides whether what is seen is real or illusory, desirable or undesirable, pleasurable or painful\" (M-8.3:11). No other deal will work. The ultimate way out is accepting the very simple and direct message at the heart of the Course's teaching: \"The secret of salvation is but this: that you are doing this unto yourself ... Whatever seems to be the cause of any pain and suffering you feel, this is still true\" (T-27.VIII.10:1,4). The \"secret\" lies in recognizing that at every moment we are choosing between the ego and its pain, or the Holy Spirit and His peace. This blows the ego's deal of keeping us out of our minds by returning us to the source that reduces pain, and puts the Atonement that will ultimately end all pain, within reach."

    "text_input": "Q #1121: I am a practitioner of Reiki in Brazil. Reiki uses the life force energy that flows through us, and it is administered by \"laying on hands.\" It's universal energy that comes from God. It's used to heal any kind of problem we have, be it mental or even physical problems. I have read that Jesus used Reiki to heal people. I strongly believe that all of us have this tremendous power inside but we don't know how to use it. I understand A Course in Miracles to be saying that our focus should not be on what we do in our lives, but on learning to understand our minds. So it doesn't matter what we do. What really is important is how our minds look at the world and the people as a whole. My question concerns the fact that I was channeled with some kind of energy that flows through me and suddenly I am doing things that I couldn't do in the past, even healing people who have physical problems. How would you explain this to me? How do you explain those people who heal others with different beliefs, even different spiritual beliefs? What's the connection between Reiki and the Course? A: The fact that Reiki involves a technique for channeling energy through the body, no matter what the source of the energy is perceived to be, means, from the Course's perspective, that it is a form of magic. Now magic, as the Course uses it, is not a pejorative term. It simply means that the effort to bring about desired changes is occurring at the level of effect, that is, through energy forces and the body, rather than at the level of cause, that is, the mind. This must be the case because the energy is operating within a spatio-temporal framework, that is, from one body to another at a specific time when those two bodies are in physical proximity, and then through the body of the one being treated.",
    "output": "The Course has a different metaphysical foundation from Reiki, and would not consider anything that can be directed through the body to be divine, or from God. The world of spirit and the world of the body are two mutually exclusive realms, only one of which is real, according to the Course (T-31.VI.1). The Course's \"technique\" is forgiveness, which seeks to bring about changes at the level of mind, not at the level of the body. For this reason, while the Course takes no position on this, it would be more consistent with the Course's teachings to see the Jesus of two thousand years ago as healing through the principles of forgiveness, which means through reminding others of the power of their own minds to make a different choice about the ego and its effects, including the body, looking on all of it without judgment and without guilt--that is the true means of healing, according to the Course. How then does Reiki produce its effects, including your own personal experience of being changed by your attunement with Reiki energy so that you can apparently produce changes in others? There are mutually and nearly universally agreed upon laws of the illusory physical and energetic universes, operating within the ego system, that all split minds share, whether individual minds are conscious of those laws or not. An obvious one is the law of gravity. These laws receive their power from the collective belief of the Sonship. Although made by the ego mind, they are neutral in themselves and can be used for either ego purposes or purposes of healing, that is, to reinforce our belief in the reality of separation and differences, or to allow us to begin to heal the guilt and thoughts of attack in our mind. Many other spiritual teachings describe aspects of energetic fields within and surrounding the body that are not visible to the naked eye that can be modified and directed by those who are tuned in to them. Yet all of these subtler energies remain a part of the ego thought system, and manipulations can have no effect unless on some level, in most cases unconscious, the minds in relationship have agreed to be affected by those apparent manipulations. Always, behind any observed effect, there is a belief at the mind level, whether the individual is aware of that belief or not. Much of the ego's belief system remains at an unconscious level so we can remain unaware of our own agreement to seem to be affected by forces outside ourselves. If we allowed ourselves to recognize and acknowledge that inner decision, we could no longer see ourselves as victims of anything outside ourselves again. Reiki does share some similarity with the Course at the level of content, since it emphasizes that the individual practitioner does not direct the healing process nor decide what problems to address. And so the practitioner is considered to be an instrument of healing, but certainly not its source. In fact, the practitioner as well as the patient is considered in need of healing and benefits through willingness to be a channel. As with all things of this world, Reiki has the power to direct the mind to an awareness of something beyond ourselves, and it does point symbolically to a seemingly invisible power beyond all appearances that intends only good for all."

    "output": "process of remembering Who we are and would be in line with the Course's teachings on the nature of mind and the world. It is in the ego's best interests and one aspect of its grand deception to maintain the belief that bodies and brains are necessary for communication. In contrast, the Course teaches that all minds are joined and communication occurs only at the level of mind/thought (e.g., T-15.IV.6:5-7; T-15.VI.8; T-15.XI.7; T-18.VI.8:3-11). Abilities that suggest there is something beyond the world of the five senses can lead to a questioning of the world's fundamental assumptions--in particular, that we are bodies at the mercy of forces outside our control (e.g., W-pI.151.2-5). This opens the door to the recognition that there is something that is not limited by the basic \"laws\" of time and space (T-18.VIII.2:1-2; W-pI.199.2:1). The ego resists this recognition, for that begins a process that can lead to the recognition that we have a mind that has the power of choice and is responsible for how we seem to experience our world. The only reason psychic powers could be considered undesirable has nothing to do with the abilities themselves but only with the purpose they are given--\"the only important consideration is how they are used\" (M-25.3:4). For if abilities are developed that transcend communication limited to the five senses, the ego's defense is to use them for displays of individual specialness, \"taking them as ends in themselves\" which \"will delay progress,\" as the section you refer to emphasizes (M-25.3:5). But if the powers are given to the Holy Spirit for His purpose of undoing our investment in the ego and its litany of limitations, they \"can be very helpful ... [and] valuable teaching aids\" (M-25.3:1-2). You may wish to review several answers already posted that address the issue of psychic abilities, #589 in particular, for it explores in depth the issue of the right-minded use of psychic powers (see also #167, #497, #623, #644, and #682)."

We just need to do our best in these roles. But in Questions #225 and #405 you say that if we can let go of our egos for an instant, anything we do with the Holy Spirit will be the right thing. I have a problem with that. For example, if I let someone attack me, aren't you implying that that would be inappropriate and not responsible to the classroom I have chosen? But at the same time, if I let",
    "output": "that person attack me, as long as I am with the Holy Spirit, it would be the right thing to do. In #3 you say it's important to do the best we can in our classrooms; yet at the end you say that in the end it does not matter what you do. The only thing that matters is whom you do it with. That's like saying something is important and then saying it's not. It is comforting for me to know that no matter what, as long as you choose the Holy Spirit and against guilt that is the right choice. So what is the answer? A: The confusion you express is common to many students of A Course in Miracles. The meaning of the principle that when you are joined with the Holy Spirit, anything you do would be loving has been badly misunderstood and misapplied, with tragic results in many cases, as mentioned in the earlier questions you referred to. When the Holy Spirit is your Teacher, your perception would be the same as His, meaning you would see only through the eyes of love, and your actions would flow from love. That automatically means that you would never do anything that would harm yourself or anyone else on any level whatsoever. To allow yourself to be attacked is to choose to be attacked. It is hard to imagine that choice flowing from love, as both you and the attacker are being harmed. In extreme cases, the choice could come from love, but it would not be experienced as an attack. This is what Jesus refers to in speaking of the crucifixion: \"I was persecuted as the world judges, and did not share this evaluation for myself. And because I did not share it, I did not strengthen it\" (T-6.I.5:3-4). He is trying to raise us to that spiritually advanced level through his teaching and mind-training exercises. But that is an ego-free level at the top of the spiritual ladder, where there is no longer any identification with the body. Until we no longer identify with the body, it is almost impossible to avoid taking attacks personally, as attacks. You can relate to this perhaps in terms of the common experience of parents dealing with the attack of an angry child. If my child is having a temper tantrum and starts to kick and scratch me, I would stop him, because it would not be loving to him to let him continue attacking, and I would be irresponsible as a parent to permit him to do whatever he wants to me. If I have chosen the Holy Spirit as my Teacher, I will not perceive my child's actions as an attack and therefore not take them personally; my restraining him will thus not be motivated by anger, fear, or vindictiveness. My firmness with him will be the most loving thing to do for both of us, reflecting my choice to join with the Holy Spirit. Now, I could have chosen to become a parent for ego reasons, but if I shift from the ego to the Holy Spirit as my Teacher, He will use this exact same role to teach me different lessons. Instead of the ego's gifts of specialness that I may have been attracted to originally, I can now accept the Holy Spirit's gifts of oneness; that is, my purpose now is to use my role as a parent to learn that my child and I share the same interests: we both have a right mind, a wrong mind, and a decision-making capacity to choose between them. Both my child and I (as minds) believe we separated from God and are trying to cope with the resulting anguish and pain of sin, guilt, and fear. That is the abiding content. In form, obviously, we are different, and I must respect that and act accordingly. So, even in disciplining him, I can be learning that he and I share the same interests (content). I am being faithful to my classroom--being a parent--but I have changed my teacher and am therefore learning different lessons. You can extend these principles to the teacher-student relationship, boss-subordinate relationship, or any other relationship in which authority is involved. Parenting is not easy. No one would disagree with that, especially parents dealing with rebellious teenagers! But the approach is always the same: seeing your relationship as a classroom with the Holy Spirit as your Teacher, Who is helping you learn how to close the gap of separation that you perceive between you and your teenager. That is the content, and that never changes; and that is the only truly important thing going on in the relationship--in any relationship. It is not the behavior that is of primary importance; but behavior should not be ignored either. Common sense is a necessary component in this entire process. The experience of most parents is that the most loving, helpful thing to do with a teenager is not all that clear. That is when you get your ego out of the way--forgiving yourself for not doing it perfectly (T-18.IV.2:3-5)--and then do what seems right. That may turn out not to be helpful and make the situation worse, or it could turn out to be very helpful. But that is not what matters; what matters is that you chose to listen to the Voice for Love instead of the ego. That is what heals your mind and gradually does away with all the interference and resistance to your unconditional acceptance of love. Your mind is being healed, and that healing extends throughout the Sonship (W-pI.137). There is no other purpose for our being here (T-24.VI.4). Having this single-minded purpose will actually help you to function more effectively in your classroom, whatever that may be; for you will become more and more free of internal conflict, and as a result be able to relate to the people in your personal world without the usual ego interferences."

And since that self is illusory, all conversations, whether seeming to happen with other physical bodies or with discarnate voices, are simply hallucinations. Now that answer may be the truth, but it is not particularly satisfying from the perspective of where we seem to find ourselves. While the Course does not address the issue of mediumship specifically, the book's very existence would have to be considered support for the validity and helpfulness of the process, since Helen Schucman viewed Jesus and not herself as the source of the material she wrote down. But she also understood that Jesus did not exist as an entity outside herself, but rather as a presence within her mind that was always available to her, whether or not she was willing to be available to him! As a point of clarification, the Course uses the word spirit differently from its more common usage, as in the case of spirit mediumship that Kardec researched and explored in the nineteenth century. In the Course, spirit refers to our reality as Christ in the Mind of God, beyond the ego split mind and any sense of individual identity (T-3.V.7:3-4; C-1.1-4). Since, as the Course teaches, mind is never inside the body (e.g., T-28.II.2:8; T-29.I.5; W-pI.72.8; W-pI.96.4:4; W- pI.167.6; W-pI.199.7:2), spirit as typically used would simply be, from the Course's perspective, any seemingly separate fragment of the ego mind, whether it happens to believe that it is currently incarnated within a body or not. And all communication therefore occurs only between minds, and not between bodies, despite what our experience seems to tell us to the contrary (see #1122 for a more in-depth discussion). If this is understood, it should be apparent that the fact that a message seems to be coming from a discarnate voice in no way assures that the message is reflecting a higher or more healed perspective. Nor does identification with a physical body necessarily preclude more advanced understanding of the true nature of reality and the means for remembering it. It is helpful to recognize that, at the level of content, there are only two possible sources for any message we receive--the ego or the Holy Spirit--regardless of where in the world of form it may seem to come from. From the Course's perspective, preoccupation with specifics and differences is a red flag that the ego is the likely source, or is at least a filter that is coloring and distorting the message. Reminders that help us step back from our judgments and recognize what we all share in common are likely to have the Holy Spirit as their Source. Near the end of the Course, Jesus speaks of the one source behind all messages of healing despite the various forms through which they may seem to be expressed and also explains why we need to experience the medium as specific: \"Why is the illusion of many necessary? Only because reality is not understandable to the deluded. Only very few can hear God's Voice at all, and even they cannot communicate His messages directly through the Spirit which gave them. They need a medium through which communication becomes possible to those who do not realize that they are spirit. A body they can see. A voice they understand and listen to, without the fear that truth would encounter in them. Do not forget that truth can come only where it is welcomed without fear. So do God's teachers need a body, for their unity could not be recognized directly\" (M-12.3). That we are all mediums who are channeling all the time--channeling either the ego or the Holy Spirit--is a helpful perspective on the whole issue of mediumship and channeling that minimizes differences and takes away the sense of specialness that our egos would like to attribute to the process. This perspective is developed and elaborated on in the audio set The Inner Voice by Kenneth Wapnick."

    "text_input": "Q #1126: You say in #225, \"As long as we experience ourselves as bodies, then we need to respond to and respect our bodily needs, both physical and psychological.\" And in #406, \"Lack of attention or concern about those responsibilities at the level of form is almost always an expression of our authority problem ...\" Does this mean that we need to follow the ego fears to respect our psychological needs? For example, do we need to travel around the world to be whole, sleep with certain people to be whole, act like a \"real man,\" or repay people's wrongs to get rid of guilt? I believe Jesus frees us from these things, but my ego would like me to believe I am not being appropriate if I don't follow what it tells me I need to be a whole person. I'm trying to get to the point where I can listen to the Holy Spirit on matters like this and not give my power away to someone who will tell me the answer. But I still am not sure what Jesus or the Holy Spirit want from me.",
    "output": "What Jesus and the Holy Spirit \"want\" from you is that you would see that the ego is all made up, and that you therefore should not take it so seriously. You already are whole and complete as God's Son (W-pII.14); but you have hidden that from your awareness and replaced it with a self that is plagued with problems and self-doubt. Jesus and the Holy Spirit are guiding you in the process of letting go of your need to keep the truth of your wholeness concealed. The ego would help you become a whole person only according to its definition of what that is. To follow the ego's guidance in anything would never help you get past guilt and fear. Without guilt and fear, there is no ego! The ego wants us to have physical and psychological needs so that we will always be in conflict and focused on satisfying those needs, which almost always happens at another's expense, thus reinforcing differences and separation. It is obvious, though, that we can never fulfill these needs perfectly and permanently. That is part of the ego's strategy to keep us glued to the world, and therefore to itself. Thus, as long as we think we are real as bodies, we are going to have needs and longings, and the frustration and satisfaction that come with them; we will also find ourselves in roles with responsibilities to fulfill in those roles: as parents, children, citizens, students, employees, supervisors, drivers, etc. This is all very normal. Spiritual advancement is not attained through defiance or fear with regard to our needs, roles, and responsibilities. But this does not mean that you must explore and experience every conceivable means of satisfying your needs: You needn't follow Don Juan's example with sex, anymore than you need to indulge your appetite for food by eating at every single restaurant in the world. When there is excessive fear or guilt over one's sexual drive, food cravings, or any other drive or inclination--for whatever reason--professional counseling is often helpful. We need to get to the point where we are comfortable with all of the normal drives and needs that we have as bodies, physical and psychological, so that we are not obsessed with indulging them, denying them, or running away from them out of fear and shame. The approach of A Course in Miracles to this--once one is fairly mature in the sense just described--is to bring into the picture the idea of purpose, i.e., for what purpose am I using my sexuality, my intellectual attributes, my strong body, my role as parent, my role as husband, etc.? This is the shift from form to content, where the real healing begins. The ego's purpose is to reinforce separation through individuality and conflict; the Holy Spirit's purpose is to help us awaken from the dream that we are separate from one another and from God. This simplifies matters enormously, because focusing on purpose (content) enables one to get past the complexities of the behavior and all of the should I? or shouldn't I? dilemmas that sometimes lead people into long-term psychoanalysis. This is what is behind this instruction of Jesus: \"It is not necessary to follow fear through all the circuitous routes by which it burrows underground and hides in darkness, to emerge in forms quite different from what it is. Yet it is necessary to examine each one as long as you would retain the principle that governs all of them. When you are willing to regard them, not as separate, but as different manifestations of the same idea, and one you do not want, they go together\" (T-15.X.5:1-3). As you are able to recognize more and more the same ego thread running through all the complexities of human behavior and attitudes, you will be able to work on getting in touch with your decision to uphold the ego thought system, which is dominated by the principles of one or the other and scarcity. This is the function of the miracle-- to bring your attention from the world and the body back to the mind, where you can then, with Jesus, look calmly at the ego dynamics that are causing the problem, and replace them with the dynamics of forgiveness, thus restoring peace and joy to your mind."

    "text_input": "Q #1127: Can you describe the process of looking at the horror and guilt in the ego with love beside you--without the use of personal symbols or names? How do you hold two completely antithetical thoughts in mind simultaneously in order to allow for the process of forgiveness? It seems that it's always one or the other. The emphasis on developing a \"personal relationship\" with either Jesus or the Holy Spirit makes me wonder how this process works if those \"relationships\" don't seem possible? What if the only figure that seems remotely plausible (in terms of having a connection) is Yogananda?",
    "output": "To look with love at anything of the ego is simply to look without judgment or guilt or fear. It is only the ego that wants you to believe that this process involves holding two antithetical thoughts in the mind simultaneously, for, to borrow the title of an audio set by Kenneth and Gloria Wapnick, \"love does not oppose.\" This idea is expressed in Chapter 23 of the text, \"The War Against Yourself\": \"Truth does not fight against illusions, nor do illusions fight against the truth. Illusions battle only with themselves\" (T-23.I.7:3-4), and then again in the workbook, in the context of determining our function: \"The ego does constant battle with the Holy Spirit on the fundamental question of what your function is. So does it do constant battle with the Holy Spirit about what your happiness is. It is not a two-way battle. The ego attacks and the Holy Spirit does not respond\" (W-pI.66.2:1-4). This is the key to the process of undoing the ego in all its horror and guilt--recognizing that there is nothing that needs to be opposed nor overcome, for to fight the ego gives it a reality that it does not have, like Don Quixote tilting at windmills. Perhaps you meant to say \"mutually exclusive\" rather than \"antithetical thoughts\" and therein lies the answer. For love is our reality and the ego, despite all the complicated forms it seems to manifest, is simply the thought that love is absent from our experience. The ego has no power in itself and can be defined only in negative terms. Just as the darkness has no reality in itself and simply vanishes with the coming of the light, so the ego is a substanceless nothingness that disappears in the presence of love and has no power to resist the love that is always there--unless we want it to. And that is really the only obstacle to releasing the ego thought system. For while we remain invested in maintaining the false individual identity that we have given birth to in union with the ego, we are making a choice to maintain a belief in the horror and guilt that must accompany this thought system as well. And so the process of looking without judgment is not something we can do easily \"on our own,\" since \"on our own\" is another way of describing the ego state of mind. The value in joining with a personal symbol of love is that it provides a gentle correction for the ego belief that we are really alone and on our own in our experience of the loneliness and pain of separation. And while we believe that our identity is a personal one, it is especially helpful to have a source of support and correction that we experience as personal as well. The mistake would be to assert that that symbol of love is not real, while still believing that we are real. The personal symbol is just as real as the self we believe we are. Now what name that personal symbol is given in our mind is not nearly so critical as that we allow ourselves to be open to a help that comes from outside our own self-centered thought system. So if Yogananda works better for you than Jesus, by all means seek his loving presence and support in looking at the false beliefs you hold about yourself. As Jesus says near the end of A Course in Miracles, in reference to himself, \"Is he God's only Helper? No, indeed. For Christ takes many forms with different names until their oneness can be recognized. But Jesus is for you the bearer of Christ's single message of the Love of God. You need no other [he was speaking to Helen and Bill in particular here]. It is possible to read his words and benefit from them without accepting him into your life. Yet he would help you yet a little more if you will share your pains and joys with him, and leave them both to find the peace of God. Yet still it is his lesson most of all that he would have you learn, and it is this: There is no death because the Son of God is like his Father. Nothing you can do can change Eternal Love. Forget your dreams of sin and guilt, and come with me instead to share the resurrection of God's Son. And bring with you all those whom He has sent to you to care for as I care for you\" (C-5.6)."

    "text_input": "Q #1128: If the entire universe is illusory or a dream, as is all form, then what is meant in A Course in Miracles: \"As miracles in this world join you to your brothers, so do your creations establish your fatherhood in Heaven.\" (T-13.VIII.9.1). What are my creations? What are God's creations? What do we create when we are fully realized? A: God's Son, who is one with Him in Heaven, shares His power of creation, which is the extension of love. The Course teaches that God created His one Son, and nothing else. Since we mistakenly believe we exist as bodies in the world, this use of words is intended to help us understand what cannot truly be explained or understood. \"God's creations\" refers to the extension of His Love to His Son, and Christ's creations are extensions of His Love (Glossary Index for A Course in Miracles by Kenneth Wapnick, p. 55). In the dream of separation our creations are reflected in the thoughts we think with God. When the mind chooses the miracle and identifies with the memory of God's Love, thereby accepting Him as Father rather than the ego. That is how the Son acknowledges or establishes that Heaven is his home, and God is his Father. Being a right-minded extension of love, this choice includes everybody and so it joins us to our brothers. None of this has anything to do with form. The mind's decision to take the ego or the Holy Spirit is reflected in the dream, but the thought/creation remains in the mind. \"Fear and love make or create, depending on whether the ego or the Holy Spirit begets or inspires them, but they will return to the mind of the thinker and they will affect his total perception\" (T-7.VI.1:5). Everything that seems to occur in our lives reflects this choice made in the mind. The mind is either projecting guilt for having chosen the ego, or extending love by choosing the Holy Spirit. The body/brain serves only as the mind's instrument. Thus, until we identify only with the mind, the body serves the Holy Spirit's purpose by interpreting everything it perceives in the light of His teaching. That is how we become aware of the mind where the decision to think with God is made.",
    "output": "One of the most important goals of the Course is to train us to become aware of all the thoughts we do not share with God. The practice of forgiveness begins with the honest recognition of all judgments that are reflections of the mind's choice for the ego as father, rather than God. Willingness to see every judgment as projections of guilt for choosing the ego, without judging oneself for it, is the way to clear the runway for the mind's creations. They follow automatically, with no effort, when judgment is relinquished. When the mind chooses to identify only with the Truth of God's Love by the acceptance of the Atonement, only love will be perceived. That is what is meant by the beautiful phrase in the text: \"When you want only love you will see nothing else\" (T-12.VII.8:1). When Identity as God's Son is fully accepted, the Son shares the Father's creative power to extend only love. That is all that can ever be created because that is all that truly exists.

    "text_input": "Q #1129: A Course in Miracles in so many words says that we forgot to laugh as we entertained the idea of separation from God, took it seriously, left Heaven, etc. This implies that creation pondered the idea of separation, could have laughed and stayed put. Does this then mean that in the created there exists an idea of discontent that can be ignored or acted upon? Collective amnesia has rendered creation not responsible for the separation. Creation made all the specifics; the nuances of pathos of caring humanity when a child is beaten, tortured and raped. A good Course student realizes it never happened and if coached correctly will even offer condolences. Yet what appears to be a spontaneous outpouring of grief was contrived and scripted before time was made. Eventually what never happened will be forgotten, it won't have existed. Must humanity undergo another collective amnesia in order to forget the illusion? A: Although your interpretation of the thought of separation as having its origin in God's creation is a common one, the Course's core teaching is that God and Christ have nothing to do with the tiny mad idea of separation, its seeming horrific effects, nor even the Correction, despite some passages that would seem to suggest differently. The part of the mind that seemed to fall asleep and dream a dream of separation does not exist in reality. Creation never pondered the idea of separation nor contains an idea of discontent. Even the Correction is outside the one Mind and merely reflects the Oneness of Heaven, being Its memory in the illusory split mind. This is not satisfactory to our ego minds that still insist that something has happened that needs an explanation. But Jesus will never give us one for, from his perspective, there can be no explanation for nothing. Variations on this issue have been addressed in a number of questions, including Question #350, #568 and #624, as well as in The Most Commonly Asked Questions About A Course in Miracles. It is very difficult to look at the world from within the world and not react to it, for the messages that are brought back to us are exactly the messages we have given to ourselves to confirm our cherished belief in the reality of the separation and our separate selves (T-18.IX.3). It is at this illusory level that we can speak of a collective amnesia that has rendered us ignorant of our mind's role in our own experience. The world seems so very real because the illusory part of us really wants it to be. Perhaps, when pondering the range of experiences--both good and bad-- that the world seems to present to us, it can be helpful to recall how vivid and even palpable many of our dream experiences when we are asleep at night seem to be. And we can hold no one",
    "output": "outside ourselves responsible for the experiences of those nighttime dreams, no matter how cruel and heartless they may be. And yet they do usually fade into nothingness upon our awakening. Our resistance is tremendous to accepting that this world that seems so real to us is no more real than the worlds of our nighttime dreams. If someone is truly a \"good Course student,\" when confronted with a tragedy or a horrible crime against a seeming innocent, such as a young child, there will be an inner acknowledgment of the pain and the guilt that everyone involved in the situation shares--the perpetrator, the victim, the families, the observers--as a defense against the love within all their minds that they also share, but are too afraid to embrace. Yes, everything that seems to happen has already been scripted and already happened, but that is not our experience. And so our choice in the present is which teacher shall we invite to look with us at the events our minds still perceive as real in our experience. If love is our guide, then our reactions will not be contrived but will be spontaneous and genuinely kind and loving. A contrived response is the work of an ego attempting to maintain its own control over a situation that it sees as somehow separate from itself. In the end, what is needed is not another collective amnesia, but an individual remembering of our role as the dreamer of our dream (T-27.VII). For with that recollection, we no longer will need to take the dream seriously and can smile at our mind's collective insanity, or silliness, to think that we could limit our reality to individual bodies, at the mercy of forces outside ourselves, that we are vulnerable and weak and will all meet our final demise, no matter what form it may take, in death and physical decay and destruction. This is not tragedy but a big joke we are playing on ourselves. And perhaps, this path with its particular set of symbols and theology is not the one you resonate to and is not the gentle way home that your mind can embrace. If not, then there is another way home that will make more sense to you and that will provide you the comfort you are seeking as you open yourself up to the love that is awaiting there within you."

    "text_input": "Q #1130: I am confused by the following sentences in the text of A Course in Miracles: \"You can temporize and you are capable of enormous procrastination, but you cannot depart entirely from your Creator, Who set the limits on your ability to miscreate. An imprisoned will engenders a situation which, in the extreme, becomes altogether intolerable\" (T-2.III.3:3-4). Who has our wills imprisoned? God?",
    "output": "We ourselves have imprisoned our wills by denying Who we really are. Our will is one with God's, which means we want only what God wills (see T-8.IV.7:1-2; T-11.III.3; T-14.III.14). In our present limited state, we cannot know precisely what that means, other than to say that our true function as God's Son is creating with Him in Heaven--extending love without limit (W- pI.192.1). Because we have denied Who we really are, we are not free to fulfill our true function, which can only lead to intolerable pain. We believe our wills are separate from God's; for example, we believe He can ask us to do something we do not want to do. The same is true of Jesus-- what he wants for us goes against what we will for ourselves, we sometimes think. We love specialness and don't want to give it up; yet Jesus tells us that our investment in specialness prevents us from knowing the truth (T-24.II.4-5). We are in a constant state of conflict and frustration as a result. As long as we believe we have our own separate identities, all we can do is miscreate, deluding ourselves into thinking we are engaged in something valuable and commendable. In the passages you cite, Jesus is teaching us that we can continue on in our false identities as separate from him and from God, but that choice will never make the separation and our individual selves reality. The truth of our oneness of will remains forever alive in our minds-- buried, but not extinguished--and at some point, however long it takes, the deep, internal pain and frustration of knowing we are wrong about everything, especially about our very selves, will cause us to cry out for \"a better way,\" as Jesus states in the sentences following the ones you cited: \"Tolerance for pain may be high, but it is not without limit. Eventually everyone begins to recognize, however dimly, that there must be a better way. As this recognition becomes more firmly established, it becomes a turning point\" (T-2.III.3:5-7). Asking his help is the first step out of our self-imposed imprisonment. Thus he teaches us: \"By the belief that your will is separate from mine, you are exempting yourself from the Will of God which is yourself ... There is no separation of God and His creation. You will realize this when you understand that there is no separation between your will and mine. Let the Love of God shine upon you by your acceptance of me. My reality is yours and His. By joining your mind with mine you are signifying your awareness that the Will of God is One\" (T-8.V.2:3,8- 12)."

    "text_input": "Q #1131: I, too, am struggling with the nature of forgiveness. Your answer to #776 was very helpful, except when you wrote in parenthesis \"this does not rule out prosecution, etc.\" Are you referring to the legal system? Can I forgive the guy that scams me (to use your illustration) and still take him to court?",
    "output": "Yes, that is what was meant. #790 was posted after you submitted your question, and perhaps you have read that answer by now. It seems to speak directly to the issue you are dealing with. One of the key points brought out in that answer is the need to function on two levels, which requires a working understanding of the difference between form and content: \"While we believe we are in the world, we generally 'give to Caesar the things that are Caesar's,' i.e., obey the rules of the world in form (file law suits, police reports, etc.). At the same time, we practice the Course by paying attention to the thoughts and judgments that arise in every situation.\" The practice of forgiveness does not lead to passivity in our relationships and encounters in the world. A Course in Miracles is not simplistic or naive. By focusing exclusively on the content we have chosen to infuse our thinking, the Course helps us get to the true source of all our problems and conflicts, and it provides us with an effective, uncomplicated way of solving them. It is just hard for us get beyond behavior (form) to the underlying content-- but that is why we must ask for help from outside our thought system; and that is what the first part of the workbook training is all about. This shift is a condition for achieving the Course's goal of peace. Prosecuting someone (form) can be done from one's wrong mind or right mind (content). The obvious signs of ego motivation include anger, vindictiveness, fear, hatred, condemnation, humiliation. Forgiving the person who cheated you has nothing to do with whether or not you press charges against him in a court of law. That may or may not be the right thing to do; it may or may not be in that person's best interests to be arrested and jailed. We cannot see the whole of our own or anyone else's Atonement path. However, if you hold no grievances against him, you will know which way to go with it, and you will be peaceful every step of the way. You can perceive him as sharing the same journey home with you (content), even as you press charges that land him in jail for several years (form). That is quite a lesson, but this course is very practical--it is meant to be put to work in the challenges of our everyday lives. We just need to become more accepting of the Holy Spirit's, rather than the ego's, purpose for our lives, our relationships, and our world."

    "text_input": "Q #1132: After reading the Course I have the impression that the ego is synonymous with Satan. Is this so? How does Christ look at hell according to A Course in Miracles? There seems to be little reference to it. Is it just the absence of salvation?",
    "output": "In traditional Christian teaching, Satan is believed to be an independent being whose guiles are capable of having an influence on others. The Course not only teaches that there is no Satan, or hell, but in reality there is no ego (see T-9.IV.5). Nothing exists outside the mind, and the belief that something or someone outside the mind can not only exist, but have an effect on it, is the hell of the mind's making. You are correct that when the Course refers to hell or the devil it is referring to the mind's choice to believe that separation is real. Jesus tells us in the text: \"The mind can make the belief in separation very real and very fearful, and this belief is the 'devil'\" (T-3.VII.5:1), and since the ego is the belief in separation, we may say that that ego is the devil. It is very important to remember, however, that the separation never happened (W-pI.137.4:3), and so neither the devil nor hell exist. They are projections of the guilt that arises from the choice to believe that separation from God is possible. They seem real because they support the mind's belief that that thought of separation is real and sinful, and deserves punishment from a vengeful God. Thus, hell and the devil are important parts of the ego thought system. Fear keeps them alive and well. In the instant that the mind decides for separation, all memory of God is obliterated from awareness, making Him \"absent\" in one's experience. That is the theological definition of hell: the absence of God or salvation. In the Course, the Christ refers to God's Son who remains one with Him in Heaven. Just as the Father in Heaven does not know of separation because He is perfect Oneness, neither does the Christ see hell. Where God and His Son are one there is nothing else. This changeless reality of Heaven is the heart of the non-dualistic teaching of A Course in Miracles. Christ is real and \"where He is God must be, for Christ is part of Him\" (T-9.I.14:7). If hell is the absence of God, where God is there is no hell. Forgiveness is the process by which the mind reestablishes awareness of its power to choose between Heaven and hell; the ego and the Holy Spirit. There is no other power but this; nothing else to choose. Learning this is one of the most important goals of the Course. It reflects the mind's choice for truth and ultimately undoes belief in the ego, hell, and the \"devil.\""

    "text_input": "Q #1133: I sense a perceptible irony and paradox in the Course's objective of eliminating our separateness from our brothers, called the Son of God, in that with increasing study and reading, there is a perceptible change within me. However, as I observe the world, especially through the news media, I note more differences between us and more separateness by not being able to  identify with the world. That is, my study is changing me towards goals which are not being equally developed in the world and we are slowly drifting apart in our concepts of ourselves. Is this the mistaken use of judgment? Or is this just increased opportunity to forgive the apparently increasing insanity?",
    "output": "There is a section in the text--\"The Greater Joining\" in Chapter 28--that may help you with your confusion about what seems to be happening in your experience. The mistake in your thinking is believing that you should feel closer to the world and its inhabitants as a result of practicing the Course. This could be an outcome for a while as you still identify yourself with your body. But Jesus' goal for us in his Course is to lead us to recognize that we are not the ego--neither the thought system of separation nor its manifestations, bodies and the world. Rather we are mind that is caught in an illusory dream of separation, believing we are the figures in that dream. And the miracle, or forgiveness, is a process whereby over time we gradually identify more and more with the mind that is dreaming and less and less with the figures within the dream. This process progresses as we learn simply to release all the judgments we have been holding on to about all the figures in the dream, including the figure we have believed to be our own separate, individual self. And so you could say that the goal of the Course is to have us learn to use separation for healing, by learning to separate ourselves as mind from the ego and all its expressions. However, this is not simply a process of intellectual denial of the world and all its insanity and suffering, for that would not be at all healing. And so we would want to ask ourselves if we are feeling some identification with and compassion towards other minds that are caught in the same painful web of ego illusion that we have been, recognizing that we all share the same underlying problem. And whenever we find ourselves in reaction to what seems to be happening with any of the figures in the dream, we have re-identified ourselves with the ego illusion and have once again made sin and guilt and pain real in our own mind, as everyone else is doing. And the solution is simply to recognize the choice we have made for the ego, not judge ourselves for making that choice, and then remember that another choice is always available, when we want it. Although you may find it helpful to read the entire section, we'll look at some excerpts from \"The Greater Joining\" that provide much of the foundation for what we have just described: \"Accepting the Atonement for yourself means not to give support to someone's dream of sickness and of death ... Unless you help him, you will suffer pain with him because that is your wish. And you become a figure in his dream of pain, as he in yours. So do you and your brother both become illusions, and without identity ... Refuse to be a part of fearful dreams whatever form they take, for you will lose identity in them. You find yourself by not accepting them as causing you, and giving you effects. You stand apart from them, but not apart from him who dreams them. Thus you separate the dreamer from the dream, and join in one, but let the other go. The dream is but illusion in the mind. And with the mind you would unite, but never with the dream ... Like you, your brother thinks he is a dream. Share not in his illusion of himself, for your Identity depends on his reality. Think, rather, of him as a mind in which illusions still persist, but as a mind which brother is to you. He is not brother made by what he dreams, nor is his body, 'hero' of the dream, your brother. It is his reality that is your brother, as is yours to him. Your mind and his are joined in brotherhood ... Identity in dreams is meaningless because the dreamer and the dream are one. Who shares a dream must be the dream he shares, because by sharing is a cause produced ... You share confusion and you are confused, for in the gap no stable self exists. What is the same seems different, because what is the same appears to be unlike. His dreams are yours because you let them be. But if you took your own away would he be free of them, and of his own as well. Your dreams are witnesses to his, and his attest the truth of yours. Yet if you see there is no truth in yours, his dreams will go, and he will understand what made the dream.\" (T- 28.IV.1:1,6-8; 2:2-7; 3:1-6; 5:4-5; 6:1-6, italics added.)"

    "text_input": "Q #1134: I have a question regarding how to \"approach\" special love and hate relationships, which are the same if I understand A Course in Miracles correctly. They keep us from \"real\" love. The Course \"recommends\" handing them over to the Holy Spirit. I have been trying to come to terms with one special relationship which involved both love and hate. At first I rejected it, then returned to it with the argument of the Course saying \"you should love your special relationships in order to have a happy dream and then \"awaken\" (sort of!).\" However, how can we love something that is ultimately \"made\" to attack God and ourselves as well? Isn't that a contradiction, and perhaps even counter-productive to our \"healing\"? Would it not then be better to \"reject\" someone and walk away? I find it very difficult, in that relationship, to \"give only love.\" There are issues that I feel need to be addressed, and when I do, ultimately the true nature of this relationship--hate--comes forth. How can we ever give true love in this world? What is more, how do we recognize it? A: You do understand correctly; every special love relationship is a mask for special hate. If it is special, it is hateful, not necessarily in form, but certainly in content. In the Course, the term \"special\" is synonymous with \"separate\" because every special relationship has belief in separation at its core. Keeping this in mind is helpful since it explains why specialness is \"hateful\" even when it looks loving. Separation is a murderous thought by which the Son of God believes he can usurp God's power, steal life from Him, and live in a body independent of His Love. That is the content of every special relationship, no matter how loving the form may seem. This distinction between form and content is the key to unraveling the confusion regarding special relationships. In content they are all the same. The problem in any relationship is not the seeming love or hate that characterizes its form, but the mind's decision to use it to sustain belief in separation, thereby defending itself against God's Love. Willingness to recognize this ego dynamic at work in the relationship you refer to is how to give it to the Holy Spirit. We need not lose the special relationships; Jesus says we will not be deprived of them: \"I have said repeatedly that the Holy Spirit would not deprive you of your special relationships, but would transform them\" (T-17.IV.2:3). The \"hate\" you experience in the relationship is the projection of the mind's guilt for having attacked God by choosing the ego. It has nothing to do with the other person. However, it is possible to work out any issues you may have on the level of form, while remaining aware of the mind's projection. The Holy Spirit is present in your willingness to recognize that the \"issues\" are not the cause of conflict in the relationship; guilt is. Although there is no true love in this world, its reflection begins with the simple acknowledgment that the origin of hate masquerading as special love is the mind's decision to choose the ego as teacher instead of the Holy Spirit. The ego focuses on form, blaming external agents for its discomfort, while the Holy Spirit asks us to see everything as a reflection of the",
    "output": "mind's choice. You know you have chosen the Holy Spirit when you find yourself becoming increasingly mindful of your projections, regardless of the judgments or hateful feelings that arise in a relationship. This is the first step in the practice of forgiveness as the Course teaches it. It is the way that everything the ego made as an attack on God can be transformed and used by the Holy Spirit to undo the belief in separation and lead us back to Him. You have taken a step in the right direction by not denying the hatred you find in the relationship. It is important not to try to change the feelings or fight against them, but to recognize that their true source is the mind's belief in separation, as we said earlier. In the Introduction to the text, Jesus makes it clear that the goal of the Course is not love: \"The course does not aim at teaching the meaning of love, for that is beyond what can be taught. It does aim, however, at removing the blocks to the awareness of love's presence, which is your natural inheritance\" (T-in.1:6-7). The blocks are all the thoughts and judgments that flow from the mind's decision to identify with the ego. They cannot be removed until they are recognized, which is why there is much emphasis, in the practice of the Course, on looking at the ego.\tExposing it to the light of the Holy Spirit's teaching is how it is undone; not by any effort on our part, but by a little willingness to see that one's own thoughts are blocking the memory of God's Love. The love that flows naturally when the mind chooses the Holy Spirit is not special because it excludes no one. It is not the \"love\" of one person for some people to the exclusion of others. The way is opened to this love when projections are acknowledged without judgment, and no attempt is made to interfere. Since everything the ego made is an attack on God, it isn't necessary to seek out situations or persons that upset you. There is nothing wrong with keeping a distance from a disturbing relationship. As with idols, if one relationship seems too much to handle, \"Another can be found\" (W-pI.170.8:7). Everything and everyone is equally important in the classroom of forgiveness. They are the form love takes until every judgment is laid aside and the Holy Spirit's Love flows uninterruptedly."

    "text_input": "Q #1135: I was hoping that you could help me by commenting on this inner dilemma that I am having as I am training with the Holy Spirit to become a Teacher of God. Jesus himself says in his Psychotherapy pamphlet that there is nothing holier or more noble in this world than helping a brother who asks for help. This is inspiring to me and I feel good that I am learning to be a messenger for the Holy Spirit. But, the dilemma that I am having is that others do not always see me the way that I see me. For example, a friend asks for help and I see it as an opportunity to teach and learn and think highly of myself and do believe that this Self-exaltation is coming from grandeur and not grandiosity. But, sometimes the other person does not see it this way and instead sees my \"kindness as a weakness\"--like that I have nothing better to do than help them with their problem for example! I guess that I feel undervalued and confused because I may not have the worldly credentials that other teachers of God have but I know that I have a lot to offer. But others only judge me on my worldly credentials and status. Why would the Holy Spirit guide me to a situation to have me be His messenger only to find out that the other person sees me as needing their approval or something? Do you think that this is a pattern that I am getting some unconscious payoff or purpose from? A: You've been caught in a very common confusion, thinking that Jesus is talking about doing things for others when he speaks of helping our brother. The line in particular from the Psychotherapy pamphlet that you refer to says, \"Nothing in the world is holier than helping one who asks for help\" (P-2.V.4:2). While we still think we are bodies, we will interpret such",
    "output": "statements at the level of the body and think, as you have, that we are being guided to come to the assistance of others who have some kind of need for specific help. There is nothing wrong with doing this, but it is not what Jesus means by this line. And if we believe we are being guided by the Holy Spirit to offer our help to others at the level of behavior, we may find ourselves very surprised at their reactions, as you have experienced. Despite what we believe to be our best intentions, this usually means that our ego has joined the relationship, and other egos can be very quick to react to ours! For we are seeing others as in need and ourselves as having what they need, even if we believe the Holy Spirit is the Source of what we think we have been sent to offer them. And this makes differences--and separation--very real. \"Trust not your good intentions. They are not enough\" (T-18.IV.2:1-2) is Jesus' caution to us when we think we know what we need to do in any situation. And earlier in the text Jesus advises: \"Do not attempt to 'help' a brother in your way, for you cannot help yourself. But hear his call for the Help of God, and you will recognize your own need for the Father\" (T-12.I.6:10- 11). Perhaps the most helpful thing to keep in mind as you are putting A Course in Miracles into practice is that it is never speaking about behavior. What we do as bodies in relationship to other bodies is not where Jesus is asking us to focus our attention and efforts. For Jesus is not addressing us as the bodies that we think we are, he is speaking to us as minds. Over time, as you begin to recognize this deeper level at which the Course is written, you may be astonished at how many of the lines and passages that you thought you understood now take on a whole new meaning. And how many of the passages that you simply overlooked because you didn't understand what they were saying now become very meaningful. Yet this is the experience of most students who commit themselves to an open-minded study of the Course, acknowledging that there is much yet that they are not ready to understand but will, as their own practice of forgiveness deepens through first recognizing and then releasing their own guilt and fear. Consider, for example, the lines that come a few paragraphs later in the same section as the above line on helping. These put the above sentence in a completely different light, as they negate the idea that there is any need for helping, or healing, as Jesus refers to it in this context; clarify what the true nature of help is--forgiveness of oneself for all the false self-accusations; and identify who is truly being helped--only ourselves. \"We are deceived already, if we think there is a need of healing. And the truth will come to us only through one who seems to share our dream of sickness. Let us help him to forgive himself for all the trespasses with which he would condemn himself without a cause. His healing is our own\" (P-2.V.7:4-7). In other words, we are always the ones in need of help, so long as we believe we are these individual selves in the world, and our brother is simply the mirror that allows us to look within. And the only help we can offer a brother is to remember the choice that we always have about whom we are going to turn to for help in any situation--the ego or the Holy Spirit. As Jesus observes earlier in the text: \"The only meaningful contribution the healer [helper] can make is to present an example of one whose direction has been changed for him, and who no longer believes in nightmares of any kind. The light in his mind will therefore answer the questioner, who must decide with God that there is light because he sees it\" (T-9.V.7:4-5). The issue of credentials then becomes irrelevant, for the help we are being invited to offer our brother has nothing to do with any specific form. In fact, our brother may not even be consciously aware of the help that is being offered through us, for we may not say or do anything at all. But we will be remembering the truth about both ourselves and our brother--that our guilt is not real. And that is the only help that any of us ever needs."

He believes this world and the body are all that exist because he has no proof otherwise; and therefore he gets very depressed when he has health issues My views are totally different. If he dies with the beliefs he has and I die with mine (both with the Holy Spirit), but at the time of physical death he still believes only in himself (ego), would we experience death differently? Also, does the Holy Spirit have any influence on us in terms of controlling how long we remain in the body/ world once we invite His memory back to guide our life?",
    "output": "From the point of view of A Course in Miracles, death is always a decision we make in our minds (W-pI.152.1:4; M-12.5:6-7), and that decision can be made with the ego or with the Holy Spirit. If it is made with the Holy Spirit, there will be no sense of regret, fear, bitterness, loss, or blame in one's mind. The mind would simply continue on as before; nothing happens to the mind because the body is no longer classified as \"living\" according to the world's standards (W- pI.167.3-4). Everything takes place in the mind and not in the body. That is what Jesus is always trying to help us realize. We, as minds, are always and only choosing to uphold the ego's thought system of separation and judgment or the Holy Spirit's thought system of oneness and forgiveness. Our experience reflects only that choice, never what goes on in our bodies. That is very difficult for us to accept, because we want so much to have Jesus validate our belief that we are real as bodies. He cannot do that, though, because it is a false belief. \"There is no death. The Son of God is free\" (W-pI.163). In answer to your second question: No, the Holy Spirit does not control the length of time we remain in our bodies once we accept Him as our Teacher. The Holy Spirit represents in our minds the truth that we split off when we chose to believe we had our own individual lives in a world apart from the world of Heaven and God. To be guided by the Holy Spirit means to think in accordance with what is true about ourselves and reality, rather than what is false. To share His perception means to consciously practice seeing everyone as having the same interests, and excluding no one from our love and compassion. Eventually, we will let go of all investment in having separation be the truth, and then there will be no difference between the Holy Spirit's perception and our own (T-14.VII.7). But all this means is that we have at last accepted back into our awareness our true Identity and the oneness of the Sonship. The Holy Spirit has not done anything. We retain our bodily identification only to the extent that we choose to keep ourselves split off from the truth. When the pain of that rejection is no longer worth it, we change our minds, and then all interferences to love and truth fall away, and we regain what we never lost. \"And what am I except the Christ in me?\" (W-pII.354.1:7)."

So will I ever be saved? A: \"All morality is of the ego, since it is based upon certain prescribed standards of behavior or conduct, all geared around what the body does or does not do ... Just as 'a universal theology is impossible' (C-in.2:5), so too is a universal morality, as values differ from one culture to the next, and change over time within individual cultures themselves. This relative nature of morality is proof that no ethical system can be of God, in Whom only the changeless and universal reality of non-dualistic truth can exist\" (p. 336). This quote is from Kenneth's All Are Called, Volume 1 of The Message of A Course in Miracles, where you will find a comprehensive presentation of ethics and morality in the context of the Course's teaching contrasted with other systems. Another discussion of this topic appears in chapter 17 of Kenneth's Love Does Not Condemn. Also, our answer to Question #637ii, discusses several important passages from the Course pertaining to morality and behavior. A study of them will help avert serious misunderstanding and misapplication of the Course's principles. A Course in Miracles teaches that the body has no independent existence; it is simply a projection of the mind, as part of the ego's strategy to make the separation real. The body expresses the thought system the mind has chosen to uphold: either the ego's or the Holy Spirit's. Therefore, there is nothing in the Course about guidelines for behavior. Its exclusive focus is on the mind's power to choose, and the consequences of the choice the mind makes. It is thus a course in mind-training, not in how to behave in the world. Our behavior flows directly from the thought system with which we identify, and so that is where our attention needs to be directed. Our sense of sin and guilt, according to A Course in Miracles, comes from our decision to reject the truth about reality and ourselves and make a substitute for it. All of this is denied and then gets projected onto our bodies and the world, which ends with our thinking that our problems and their solutions are in the body (behavior) and the world. Since the ego was born of selfishness, murder, deception, and theft--it knows nothing else--then when we choose to identify with the ego, the content in our minds will be the same as the ego's. We cannot but act that out in the world as long as we have elected to have the ego as our teacher. We don't realize, however, that this is what runs our lives, which is why we need help from a source outside our thought system entirely: Jesus or the Holy Spirit. This is the core of the Course's teaching and exercises. Understanding the form-content distinction is central to the practice of A Course in Miracles as it was meant to be practiced. Salvation in A Course in Miracles has to with changing our teacher from the ego to Jesus or the Holy Spirit--or any other ego-less presence we are comfortable with. If we do this, which we would when our pain and despair causes us to cry out for \"another way,\" then we would begin the process of thought-reversal (e.g., M-24.4:1)--of going back into our minds, with this loving presence guiding us, and looking without judgment at all manifestations of our mistaken choice: judgment, specialness, selfishness, authority issues, one-or-the-other and kill-or-be-killed type thinking, etc. As students of this course, we learn that choosing this insane thought system was simply a mistake in need of correction, not a sin deserving of punishment. We realize, too, that it has not brought us the peace and happiness we were led to believe it would. Now, happily and thankfully, we allow our new teacher to guide our thinking. When, once and for all, we let go of the ego, the only content in our minds will be love; we will have restored to our awareness what we had split off and concealed--the memory of our true Identity as Christ. This is the acceptance of the Atonement, for which no sacrifice is necessary (W-pI.192.6:1). Guided only by love, everything we then do would be loving. It would be impossible to do anything that would hurt ourselves or anyone else. What that looks like specifically (form) cannot be formulated. The same behavior can originate in one's wrong or right mind (content). In your case, therefore, whether or not you should return what you claim you stole is between you and the Holy Spirit. When in a holy instant you are free of ego interference, you will just know. And if there is no clarity, then just be as ego-free as you can for a moment, and then do what seems most loving for yourself and the others involved. We will never run out of opportunities to learn our lessons of forgiveness! (T-31.VIII.3) Finally, God has nothing to do with any of this, as the separation, the ego and its dynamics, and the undoing of all that is inherently unreal. That is why Jesus uses various metaphors and images to talk about it: a nightmare dream of separation, a journey, a ladder. Correcting various religious traditions, he also makes it unmistakably clear that God, as Love, can only love and extend that love for eternity--condemnation and love are mutually exclusive: \"God does not forgive because He has never condemned\" (W-pI.60.1:2; see also W-pI.198)."

    "text_input": "Q #1138: I have for some time wondered about the following question in relation to the metaphysics in ACIM: How real is other people's suffering? Are there people out there having their own perceptions of suffering (sorrow, pain, etc.) or are these perceptions \"only\" in my mind. More concretely: It bothers me to perceive that other people --my ex-wife--are having problems of different kinds (and of course we always have to do what we can to help on a practical level). Seen from a metaphysical level, are they \"only\" perceptions of suffering in my mind and \"not really out there\" in these people? A: Yes, suffering is not really \"out there\" because nothing is really out there. Whatever is perceived in the dream of separation is a reflection of the mind's choice to listen to the ego or the Holy Spirit. A Course in Miracles teaches that all suffering is caused by the belief that the oneness God shares with His Son can be shattered by the dream of separation. To be separate is to suffer, thus everyone who believes in separation is suffering, whether it appears so in form or not. Even the ego's \"joy\" is a camouflage for suffering, a deceptive ploy to keep the mind from realizing the painful impact of maintaining belief in the illusion of separation. The first thing to remember, therefore, is that all separated ones are suffering the devastating effects of believing that the mind of the Sonship that God created one with Him can be limited to life in a body in a physical universe filled with pain. Life's ups and downs, pleasures and woes are part of the ego's scheme to keep the painful consequences of accepting its thought system from awareness. That is why an important part of the Course's learning process is getting in touch with the misery that underlies the experience of life in a body. Jesus does not mince words in this regard: \"You who are steadfastly devoted to misery [separation] must first recognize that you are miserable and not happy. The Holy Spirit cannot teach without this contrast, for you believe that misery [separation] is happiness\" (T-14.II.1:2-3).",
    "output": "So much for all the effort and energy spent finding \"happiness\" in this world as bodies. The mind's decision to be separate and identify with a body is a painful distortion of the truth; a lie that can only cause pain. Therein lies the source of all suffering, including the disquiet seemingly caused by perceiving pain in someone else. So you are correct; being upset by another's suffering is the reflection of one's own pain. This does not mean being indifferent to others' pain. True empathy, as the Course teaches, begins with realizing that being upset by another's pain means one is in as much pain as the other. Both have made the same mistake (choosing to identify with the ego); both have a mind that can choose differently. Thinking along these lines identifies the true source of pain and opens the mind to true healing. Meanwhile, on the level of form, it is appropriate to do whatever may be helpful to comfort oneself or another. The ultimate goal of the Course is to lead us to the release of all pain and suffering by our awakening from the dream of separation. This is accomplished as guilt is undone through the process of forgiveness. As belief in illusions is weakened guilt diminishes, thereby diminishing pain. Each instant of forgiveness sets in motion the mind's healing of the belief in separation. Thus, the most compassionate response to suffering--one's own or another's--is willingness to allow the healing of forgiveness to transform perception: \"A dying world asks only that you rest an instant from attack upon yourself, that it be healed\" (T-27.V.5:5)."

    "text_input": "Q #1139: My wife, whom I love very deeply, is a very nurturing and tender woman. I enjoy her mothering me, and she makes me feel safe and loved. I know that Jesus says he will not take special relationships from us, but will transform them. But are some special relationships worse then others? Are special needs different from special relationships, and are we allowed to have them? It seems to me that everyone has special needs and we all give and take; we all need people to not hurt us--not that our peace of mind is dependent on our special needs being met. How can I understand and dispel this fear that my relationship with my wife is somehow wrong? What would our relationship look like as it is transformed? It scares me to death to open this issue to you and leave myself vulnerable to any judgments you might have. A: It is not the purpose of A Course in Miracles, nor ours on this Service, to judge anyone for being involved in a special relationship. It is just about impossible not to be involved in one, for as you say, we all have needs, and we all look to others to fulfill those needs and not hurt us. What Jesus is teaching us is that these relationships are based on a hidden premise that we need to bring into the light and question--specifically, that we are incomplete and it is not our fault. The ego has pulled the wool over our eyes with this, and therefore we do not see how we are actually hurting, not helping ourselves by seeking for comfort and completion outside us. We don't realize that this is just the ego's way of sustaining its own existence. Jesus thus wants us to see how we are selling ourselves short when we become involved in what he calls \"an endless, unrewarding chain of special relationships\" (T-15.VII.4:6). Yes, we may experience comfort and security in a relationship--that is not wrong and we are not asked to stop that --but the security and comfort are always temporary, limited, and fragile. At any moment everything could change, and we would be back at square one, wondering what to do to have our needs met again. Jesus is teaching us that there is a much better way of relating to others, one that will not disappoint us, because it will restore lasting peace and happiness to our awareness. The better way, of course is changing the purpose of the relationship from the ego's to the Holy Spirit's, with the confident expectation that we will feel much better if we do.",
    "output": "Thus, this is not about showing you that your relationship with your wife is wrong, but rather about changing the purpose of that relationship so you will get back in touch with the love in your mind that is your true identity, as well as your wife's. A transformed relationship is one in which you experience your centeredness in Jesus' love, and therefore have no needs that you look to have filled by another. The holy relationship is entirely a matter of the content you have chosen in your mind; it is not about bodies behaving in a different way. Relationships are only in the mind, and accepting the Holy Spirit's purpose for the relationship does not necessarily mean that anything would change externally. Most often it does not. It is an inner change that takes place, in the sense that you are more kind and loving in your attitude--less judgmental, less needy, less guilty and fearful. You would realize that the relationship is not about what bodies do together, but about minds sharing the same interests and ultimately the same identity, both within the illusion and in truth as God's innocent, invulnerable Son. The sense of separation between you and your partner would gradually diminish in importance and relevance, and would be replaced by a growing sense of your sameness. There is bound to be discomfort in looking at the special relationship because of its roots in self- deception, and especially because its purpose to be a substitute for God's Will (T-17.IV.2:7). We have buried in our minds intense guilt and fear over this, and so it is necessary to retrace our steps to get beyond the ego to the love that it hides. Jesus guarantees our success in this, and never puts pressure on us to get on with it. Only a little willingness to question our beliefs and values is asked of us. Jesus' comforting presence will guide us through each step of the process. \"The Atonement is so gentle you need but whisper to it, and all its power will rush to your assistance and support. You are not frail with God beside you\" (T-14.IX.3:2-3)."

This is when resistance occurs in me and really scares me. It seems so lonely to be with God and being only one.

The fear you describe keeps the world population exploding. We find long waiting lines at Disneyland, but certainly not at Heaven's gate.

The ego's only reality is",
    "output": "the multiplicity of separation. It looks on oneness with terror, because its existence depends on duality. The sum and substance of its cycle of life and death is variety, change, excitement, emotional roller coasters, and diversity. In fact, the ego's theme song proclaims: \"The only constant thing is change.\" To strengthen its case for separation, the mind conjures up visions of Heaven as a place of boring, lonely, annihilation. This is a perfect example of the principle of projection: when the mind experiences the loneliness of its self-imposed exile caused by its rejection of its Identity as God's Son and abandonment of its home, it denies the loneliness of separation and makes up a substitute \"home\" (the world), replete with special relationships to fill the empty void. It then projects what has been denied and perceives Heaven as a lonely place of exile. All this is done to protect the mind from realizing the devastating effects of choosing separation, so it can continue to cling to it. The mind turns everything upside down to defend itself against choosing to return home with God, where all sense of loneliness disappears and every fragment of the Sonship (parents, children, friends) is joined in the oneness of God's Love. In response to our fear of returning to our true home, Jesus has a very comforting message: \"Fear not that you will be abruptly lifted up and hurled into reality. Time is kind, and if you use it on behalf of reality, it will keep gentle pace with you in your transition\" (T-16.VI.8:1-2). Not only is time kind, but the forgiveness that Jesus teaches is a kind and gentle healing process. It does not take special relationships away, but transforms them to include those whom they were meant to exclude. The pace is set only by our willingness to forget the ego's separation lie and remember what it means to be one. While the mind identifies with the body, it makes eyes that see other bodies that seem real, and emotional attachments that seem more real than the oneness God created. These special relationships with loved ones are the ego's substitutes for the relationship between the Father and His Son; the only true relationship. This can only be understood in the context of the Course's teaching that we are minds, not bodies. A Course in Miracles teaches that nothing exists outside the mind (T-18.VI.8). The mind that chooses to believe the separation is real splits into two parts. The right mind remembers the oneness of God's Love, and every fragmented part of the Sonship is included in that memory. No one is excluded, lost, or lonely. The love that flows from this part of the mind embraces family members, along with everyone else. When the mind chooses this all inclusive love as its only identity, it joins with the oneness of God's Love; the Heaven it never left. The wrong mind, on the other hand, chooses to identify with the body that is exclusive by the very fact that it is bound by limitations. A body not only cannot love everybody, it cannot love at all. \"It [the body] was made to limit the unlimited\" (T-18.VIII.1:3). In contrast, \"Love has no limits, being everywhere\" (W-pI.103.1:4). We may therefore conclude that what is limited is not love. What the world calls \"love,\" the Course calls specialness; a \"love\" subject to change, disappointment, and loss. What changes does not last, and so, however pleasurable or noble it may seem to be, the ego's love will inevitably end. What does not last is not real, or eternal, or found in Heaven. The ego's answer to life's pain and anguish is a belief system that teaches that we will find beloved individuals in Heaven. This is a heaven that mirrors the world, only better. It is designed to support belief in the separation and the ego's dualistic God. Heaven is not only not the lonely place projected by the ego, it is the state of mind in which everyone is included as one. Through the process of forgiveness, what was special love reserved only for certain people is gradually transformed to the all-inclusive love of the right mind. There are many passages in the Course describing the beauty of the real world that precedes the step into the eternity of Heaven. Though we are not asked to understand what has been obliterated from awareness by the \"heavy garments of guilt\" (T-18.IX.9:7), you might imagine the loving feelings you have toward your parents and son expanded to embrace everyone. That is the end result of the mind joining with itself and finally feeling at home. Meanwhile, until the last spot of darkness is removed, and nothing remains to blur the vision of our forgotten home, our only concern is the ongoing practice of forgiveness: small, but certain steps in undoing the belief that the body is all there is."

    "text_input": "Q #1142: The Course's metaphysics says we are reviewing experiences. What and who did the initial experiencing? If the answer is still us (or the observer), how do we know we are not doing that initial experiencing right now as that would line up with \"traditional\" ego perceptions of space and time. Is the answer that the initial creation was made outside space and time by the separated Christ, that in a flash, due to the incredible creative power of Christ, the ego emerged, got so immersed in the thought of separation, splintered itself into almost infinite (recursive) thoughts, that it eventually believed it truly was separate, developed guilt, and then began reviewing everything it had created in human experience terms; i.e., in terms of space and time as separate bodies? In other words the initial experience was not as humans, but just thought, but that the incredible creative ability, and unfortunately ensuing guilt of this creativity, transformed that experience into us as separate bodies. A: A Course in Miracles states that \"we but see the journey from the point at which it ended, looking back on it, imagining we make it once again; reviewing mentally what has gone by\" (W- pI.158.4:5). Importantly, this statement comes after Jesus explains that time is not what we think it is; he corrects our ego-based understanding that time goes in one direction and contains a future unknown to us (W-pI.158.3:5,7). He tells us that time is part of the ego's plot to divert us from the truth; and as such, it is \"a trick, a sleight of hand, a vast illusion ... \" (W- pI.158.4:1).This reflects the statement in the text that says, \"Each day, and every minute in each day, and every instant that each minute holds, you but relive the single instant when the time of terror took the place of love ... Such is each life; a seeming interval from birth to death and on to life again, a repetition of an instant gone by long ago that cannot be relived. And all of time is but the mad belief that what is over is still here and now\" (T-26.V.13:1,3-4).",
    "output": "Jesus is addressing us as decision-making minds outside time and space that are tangled up in the dynamics of denial, projection, and defenses. Ultimately, there is only one mind (lowercase), the Son of God who believes he has successfully split off from his reality in the perfect Oneness of God (a separation the Course defines as impossible, and therefore totally illusory). The Son of God in this context is not Christ, Who remains at one with God as His creation in Heaven. Creation, in the Course's view, is completely different from the biblical notion, which has to do with God creating outside Himself. God creates only like Himself (T-8.II.7:6); and creation is the eternal, non-spatial extension of love that takes place only in Heaven--God creating Christ, and Christ continuing the extension of love in His creations. The separated Son retains the memory of His true Identity as Christ, though it is concealed from his awareness by his own choice. The ego is simply that part of the Son's mind that he now thinks he is, having split off his true Self (Christ); and as such, it represents the thought system of separation. In the instant the separation from Totality and Wholeness was thought to have occurred, every conceivable form of separation spun out instantaneously. The dynamics of separation involve getting as far away from oneness as possible so that the original state of oneness is no longer remembered, and even considered alien and unnatural: \"Complete abstraction [formlessness] is the natural condition of the mind. But part of it is now unnatural. It does not look on everything as one. It sees instead but fragments of the whole ... \" (W-pI.161.2:1-4). \" ... he does not realize he has forgotten where he came from, where he goes, and even who he really is\" (W-pI.166.4:4). Guilt is bound up with the belief in separation, but only because the choice to separate from God was branded as sinful by the ego. A massive system of defenses evolved to deal with the pain of that guilt in the mind, which characterizes a major aspect of our experience as humans, except that we are not aware of this underground dynamic. That is one of the purposes of the Course-- to help us regain our awareness of ourselves as minds, so that we can deal with the source of all our problems and pain, and learn that sin and guilt are made-up concepts. Ultimately, we will realize that the only problem is that instead of smiling at the silliness of the idea of separating from Totality, we, as the one Son of God, took it seriously (T-27.VIII.6:2-3), and then began the process of miscreation, as A Course in Miracles refers to the works of the ego. Our only responsibility, our only purpose, is to accept the Atonement for ourselves, which means remembering that we never truly separated from our Source."

    "text_input": "Q #1143: I have a question about emotionality and special relationships. I seem to have had one which resulted in both extreme love and feeling nothing at all simultaneously. Could you recommend anything on how to deal with extreme emotional ties where you know that it does not help you any further but you are still unable to let go? I am somewhat confused by the fact that one person can rouse both extreme love/hate and remind me at the same time of a more universal love. I suppose both are but in me but it's difficult to deal with. I have tried to work on this with a number of psychologists but to no avail basically. The decision to leave seems to be mine but it appears kind of cold. I suspect my question comes down to \"what is love?\" How does A Course in Miracles define love? I feel I am physically and emotionally in pain almost to the point of withdrawal symptoms (special love/hate). I read the Course and understand it on a mental level but emotionally feel all the hurt and pain. Healing only comes in small (illusionary) steps. Why do we do this to ourselves? Indian yogic systems use extreme emotions as breakthroughs to the more universal love. I suppose A Course in Miracles would not approve of any such techniques.",
    "output": "It may be helpful to remember that extreme emotional feelings are really not different from milder experiences of the same feelings (e.g., W-pI.21.2:3-5; M-17.4:3-8). And our attempts to make sense of them, regardless of their intensity, are merely clever diversions orchestrated by our egos to keep us from recognizing the real issue: all pain comes from our decision to see ourselves as separate from love (T-28.III.5:1). The scripts of our lives, with all their various relationships, are ego symbols that play out, in form, the ultimate ego drama in the mind, one in which we believe we are pitted in a life-and-death struggle with God, Who seeks vengeance for our attack on Him, when we wrested our autonomous individual self from His Oneness. And, the ego tells us, that struggle is one that in the end we will lose, for we all shall die. Why do the feelings--both positive and negative--seem more intense within some relationships than others? There is really no answer to that question except to say that, when the ego's scripts were written long ago, some of the script's symbols, that is, the figures within the dream, seemed to be invested with more projected guilt than others. And so those symbols, which seem to be external to us, are mirroring the hidden contents of our minds, which we do not want to accept within ourselves. More intense relationships provide us an opportunity to look deeper within ourselves. Should we ever allow ourselves to look calmly beyond the external relationship to the underlying conflict within, Jesus assures us, we would see the inner battle with God as merely silly and not at all serious. But the world of relationships keeps our focus outside the mind, so that we attribute all of the intensity and emotionality to the interactions we seem to be having with other individuals separate from ourselves. Yes, this is how we are experiencing the conflict, and we are not expected to deny our feelings. But we are being invited to consider a different interpretation of our experiences, one in which we learn to recognize that we are solely responsible for our feelings (T-21.II.2:3-5) and others are simply the excuses we have made up to assign the responsibility elsewhere. And so long as we project responsibility for our feelings outside ourselves, no genuine healing is possible--only a pseudo-healing that involves special love bargains or compromises in which we always feel we must give up something in order to get what we think we want. Whenever we find ourselves wanting anything from someone else, we have already made a decision to identify with the ego thought system of separation, differences, limitation, and loss. And this decision, by its very nature, must be experienced as painful, since the choice for the ego is the choice against love. How could the decision to see ourselves as bereft of love, lost and all on our own, be experienced as anything but extremely painful? As for how the Course defines love, Jesus says in the Introduction to the text, \"The course does not aim at teaching the meaning of love, for that is beyond what can be taught. It does aim, however, at removing the blocks to the awareness of love's presence, which is your natural inheritance (T-in.1:6-7). So you will find no definition of love in the Course, because love, which is our reality, is beyond all limits, all boundaries, all concepts. Nevertheless, the Course says enough about love and what love is not to make it clear that what passes for love in this world--what the Course calls special love--is at best \"a shabby substitute\" (T-16.IV.8:4) and at worst a contradiction of love's reality. Love simply is, having no degrees of depth or intensity, and it cannot change (W-pI.127.1:3-6; 2:1-3). Whatever seems to change or alter with conditions and circumstances can only be an aspect of the ego thought of separation, and so it must be hate, since the ego was made to be loves opposite. In dealing then with what you are experiencing as extreme emotions that seem to range from love to hate, it is helpful to recognize that all of those feelings are of the ego. The ego's \"love\" is riddled with ambivalence (T-4.III.4), since the ego itself is nothing but an ambivalent thought. And so its projections into a world of form can only be experienced with ambivalence, so long as the ego remains our guide and teacher. And so our feelings, grounded as they are in the ambivalence of the ego's oppositional nature, can only fluctuate between special love and special hate--that is their range. And yet always, beneath the layers of hate and special love and guilt, lies our genuine love for our Father--and the memory of our oneness--that these layers were intended to conceal. But so long as we refuse to recognize the real problem, we will seek for answers to seemingly important yet ultimately irrelevant questions, such as, \"What should I do about this situation or relationship? Should I continue or end it? And how do I stop the pain?\" However, all relationships can be helpful if we have the right teacher. Now their helpfulness has nothing to do with whether we choose to remain physically in a relationship with someone or not, but only with whether we choose to accept this other person as a mirror to our own unconscious, which we are now being given the opportunity to bring to the light and examine. And then we begin to understand that the only question is \"How can I look at myself differently?\" The goal is not to see the other person differently, but to recognize why I am choosing to see that person the way that I am. It is always a defense against looking at the self- accusations and the self-hatred within my own mind, where I could do something about my choice for the ego, with its accompanying conflict and pain. And it is in this looking that I begin to understand why I do this to myself--to protect my false sense of self from the boundless love of our true Self that knows nothing of judgment or limitation. We cannot experience love directly in this world, while we remain identified as separate, individual selves. But we can experience its reflection--forgiveness, which \"is still, and quietly does nothing ... It merely looks, and waits, and judges not\" (W-pII.1.4:1,3). And the forgiveness, while it may seem to be experienced in relationship to another person, is truly only ever for ourselves. Other spiritual thought systems may use the intense emotions you speak of as means for breaking through to the universal love, and the Course would pass no judgment on such approaches. But for those of us whose path is the Course, Jesus is inviting us to embrace his kindly practice of forgiveness, which involves no intense breakthroughs, but only a gentle melting within (T- 18.VI.13-14). The peace that always awaits us arises in our awareness once we have been willing to look at and release our own choice for and investment in all the various expressions of the ego's intensity."

It was clear that this was only because of the projection of others onto me, since I had not harmed anyone and had healed many\" (T-6.I.9:2-3). As I understand projection, in my mind I see love and do not want it; so I imagine a human form, Jesus, which I attack and destroy. Jesus or love, on the other hand, sees my reaction and understands it as a call for love, and he returns this love, which I would interpret in a number of ways. One possibility is that I see him not resisting or defending himself. This projection is quite a block for me.",
    "output": "The section of A Course in Miracles in which the quote appears is called \"The Message of the Crucifixion\"; Jesus is referring to what took place twenty-one hundred years ago. People were extremely threatened by the love he expressed and that he was. As you say, we all accuse ourselves of rejecting love, and our guilt over that is so overwhelming that the only recourse we think we have is to project the guilt onto someone else and attack that person (T-31.III.1). That is what Jesus is saying happened back then. People had to find something they could accuse him of and feel justified in doing so; otherwise the pain of their guilt would have been unbearable. He, however, did not experience what, to the world, looked like betrayal, abandonment, torture, and death. With no ego, Jesus could not have experienced any of that; he knew he was not his body. He could only love, recognizing people's calls for love in their viciousness. His message thus is: \"You are merely asked to follow my example in the face of much less extreme temptations to misperceive, and not to accept them as false justifications for anger\" (T-6.I.6:7). Whenever you feel your anger is justified, you have projected your unconscious guilt onto the person you are angry with. This does not mean that the person may not have said or done something that was not loving. Without guilt, however, it would be impossible to justify your anger, regardless of what happened; in fact, at the top of the spiritual ladder, you would not get angry at all, as you would perceive the pain and fear behind people's viciousness, and you would feel only compassion. This content in your mind would then be expressed in a form appropriate to the situation."

    "text_input": "Q #1145: Is there any specific meaning in the use of the figure \"5,\" \"50,\" etc. within A Course in Miracles, in particular in the workbook? Certain Christian/gnostic sects and similar organizations are said to have used certain symbols, as perhaps the pentagram as the symbol of Christ. I found it interesting that the \"centre of our being,\" the holy instant is also sitting comfortably at the centre of the 31 chapters of the textbook and, 1+5=6, perhaps secretly alluding to the \"inner Christ\" or Son of God anyway (the figure 6 as symbolized by Tiphareth/Son of God in the kabbala)? Is there any \"reason\" behind the structure of the workbook, certain lessons building up on each other in a certain \"symphonic\" way? Could A Course in Miracles, as a whole, perhaps be regarded as \"holographic\" in structure and content?",
    "output": "As far as we are aware, there is no special meaning in the numbering and symbols used in the Course. It is written in such a way, however, that one could find all kinds of things along the lines you mention. That was never anything that Helen Schucman and Bill Thetford related to, though; and we at the Foundation do not either. The structure of A Course in Miracles can quite easily fit into the symphonic or holographic model. Kenneth often speaks of this, and has described it explicitly and at length in his introduction to the series of classes he gave on each of the three books of the Course. In introducing his classes on the manual for teachers, for example, he states: \"My presentation on the text ... followed a musical format, taking not only Jesus as my inspiration, obviously, but Beethoven as well. Our journey was like a symphony within a symphony, each lecture built around the various themes of the text's thirty-one chapters, which reflected the symphonic nature of the text itself. Although the form is slightly different, I have done the same thing in these lectures on the manual for teachers, using music as the inspiration for their structure, and, again, Beethoven as the model, specifically the third movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony ... As I thought about the structure for these classes, this movement came to mind because the manual itself is organized around two themes and variations of these two themes, specifically the first.\" The holographic model can be recognized in the fact that if we understood completely any one statement of the Course, we would understand the Course's message in its entirety. If we completely understood the first miracle principle--that there is no order of difficulty among miracles--there would be no need to read or study anything further in the Course. The same could be said of the very first lesson, or any other lesson. But because of the intense fear in our minds, Jesus leads us gradually. He told Helen and Bill to study the \"notes,\" so that they would be prepared for what was to follow--a message that is included, in part, near the end of Chapter 1 of the text (T-1.VII.4). The early lessons in the workbook initiate a process of mind training, and they incorporate a certain amount of structure and discipline that will not be needed in later stages of the process. The Introduction to the workbook discusses this dimension of the Course. The workbook is carefully and intentionally structured to achieve maximum results, given the state of our minds' beliefs and fears."

    "text_input": "Q #1146: This is about lucid dreaming, the ability to realize while dreaming that everything that is happening is only a dream. Then you can control your dream and your dream stops controlling  you. I've been experiencing this phenomenon and I've learned to produce it at will. How can this kind of dream help me with A Course in Miracles and the Holy Spirit's purpose?",
    "output": "It can be very helpful. A primary objective of Jesus' mind-training program is to help us become lucid dreamers, which means becoming aware that what appears to us as real is not real--we are just dreaming of ourselves as individuals in a physical world: \"You are at home in God, dreaming of exile but perfectly capable of awakening to reality\" (T-10.I.2:1). Jesus is not referring to our dreams at night, but to our experiences in our daily lives. Yet, he also tells us these are not different states in terms of their content: \"All your time is spent in dreaming. Your sleeping and your waking dreams have different forms, and that is all. Their content is the same. They are your protest against reality, and your fixed and insane idea that you can change it\" (T- 18.II.5:12-15). Being a lucid dreamer, you probably can relate very much to Jesus' discussions of dreaming. It is a major theme in the Course, but there are several sections that focus specifically on the nature and purpose of the dream: four sections in Chapter 18 (T-18.I,II,III,V) and two in Chapter 27 (T- 27.VII,VIII). Purpose is the key word, and that is where our work as students is centered. Are we upholding the ego's purpose in our lives or the Holy Spirit's purpose? The ego wants us to stay asleep and to continue to dream, without ever realizing that that is what our lives amount to. The Holy Spirit wants us to realize that we are merely dreaming that we are separate; it is not the truth. Jesus thus says of the miracle that it \"does not awaken you, but merely shows you who the dreamer is ... The miracle establishes you dream a dream and its content is not true\" (T- 28.II.4:2; 7:1). We can begin the process of awakening by accepting the Holy Spirit's purpose of learning to see each other as sharing a common interest--that we are all in pain for having left our loving home in Heaven, and we are all desperately hoping there is a way back that does not involve eternal punishment. The Holy Spirit thus represents the Atonement principle, the fulfillment of our hope that what awaits us is only love, for we never truly left. This is the dream Jesus refers to that precedes our final awakening, \"a gentler dream, in which his suffering was healed and where his brother was his friend ... \" (T-27.VII.13:4)."

    "text_input": "Q #1147: Today a friend of mine mentioned something related to \"sowing your wild oats\" and it brought up some conflict within me. I remember when I was married back when I was 22, I was tormented with thinking I needed to sleep with other women to gain my peace of mind because I felt like I didn't know what it was like to. It was like that whispering voice that says you won't know until you try it. I would like to think that someone could have one relationship and be content and not wonder that completion lies within another relationship. My friend's comment brought up some old fears within me and even now I still wonder if I'm missing something in my experience of life. Another fear of mine is that I am not a complete man because I have never gotten into a fist fight with another man and so I feel like I would need to seek this to be whole. I guess I feel like I'm not like other men. Also, #202 says that, \"Children must first learn to become strong, healthy egos in order to function effectively and to cope with the many challenges in world.\" How do I know my ego is developed enough so I can move on and follow the teachings of A Course in Miracles?",
    "output": "That \"whispering voice\" that tells us that we need to do more, that we are not enough, that we are incomplete, that something needs to be different--in our relationships, in our personalities, in our bodies, in our lives--is always the voice of the ego (T-29.VIII.8). Always! Now, knowing that, we still may choose to listen to it, and most of us do, most if not all of the time. And that's no sin. What we seek after won't make us genuinely happy, but if we believe it's more spiritual to deny that nagging inner voice or resist its urges, more than likely we will then feel as if we are sacrificing something important, and the ego will still have us in its grip. For the worldly experiences we've deprived ourselves of will still feel very real and we will have once again embraced the ego's religion, whose tenets hold that God and love demand that we sacrifice what we think we want for the sake of some greater good (T-15.X.7:1-2). So if you feel you are not whole or complete, or not the man you think you should be, and you believe there is something that may help you feel better about yourself, you may certainly want to check it out. Now of course you may want to choose your fight carefully, and perhaps a round of boxing with the gloves on could help minimize the risk of broken knuckles and jaws, or brain damage! For most of us, the only way to be willing to move along on our spiritual path is to allow ourselves to experience what we believe will make us feel better about ourselves. Then we can see, after having the experience, that the emptiness and the sense of inadequacy still remain, for those feelings are not coming from what we do or don't do, but from what we believe about ourselves at the core of our very being. Oh yes, temporarily we may feel better about ourselves after some conquest, but the fix never lasts. For it hasn't addressed the source of the emptiness and self-loathing, which come from a decision buried deep in our unconscious to be different from God, rejecting the one Relationship that brings the sense of completion that we futilely search for outside ourselves (T-30.III.3). To a degree, the observations made about children in the question you cite apply to all of us. We will not be willing to let go of our investment in the ego until we have come to a full realization that it offers us nothing (T-4.IV.6:1-2; T-9.I.10:2-3), for it is nothing (T-7.VI.11:4-7; T-7.X.3:8- 9; T-11.II.7:6). And for most of us, the only way to recognize that is to continue to turn to the ego for guidance and then to look very honestly at the outcome. Now it may be a little like banging our head against a brick wall and wondering why we have a headache and where the blood is coming from, but until we make the connection, we will continue to ask the wrong teacher how to feel better about ourselves. In the end, we will all come to recognize the real content behind the ego thought system, and then it's just a matter of how much time we decide to continue unnecessarily to prolong our agony. But regardless of how stubborn and childish we may be, Jesus assures us a happy outcome is certain (T-4.II.5; W-pI.71.6). This does not mean that, as adults, we are confronted with an \"either-or\" choice between developing our ego and practicing the Course. As students of the Course, we can learn to be gentle with ourselves about our ego-based decisions so that we do not use them to reinforce our guilt. If we can watch ourselves choosing our ego without guilt, we will be more willing to look at the outcome of our ego identification and will come that much sooner to the recognition that each time we dip into the ego's well of experiences, we come up empty. You may find #614 on masculinity and spirituality of some relevance to your concerns."

He also asked that when I struck it rich that I would remember him. I gather that most people believe that it is the right thing to do to honor what we say, and that even God himself asks this. My problem is that after I said these things conflict began to arise in me, as my agreement seemed to mean that I should give him a part of all my money from now on. I began to hate him for this and even now cringe at people who say you should do what you say. Would Jesus enforce this? Promises of any kind now strike fear in my heart. Do you have any comforting words for this problem?",
    "output": "Jesus defines honesty as \"consistency\"--it is one of the 10 characteristics of the advanced teacher of God (M-4.II.1). He teaches that is not just a matter of the words you say, but that \"there is nothing you say that contradicts what you think or do ... At no level are they [the truly honest] in conflict with themselves\" (M-4.II.1:6,8). If you said the words \"but only in jest,\" then it would seem inconsistent to obligate yourself to stand by them. Apparently you never told your friend that your promise was made in jest. It would seem advisable to do so, and then you might have more peace of mind. The only promise Jesus takes seriously is the one we made in our creation, and which we have blocked from our awareness: \"God keeps His promises; His Son keeps his. In his creation did his Father say, 'You are beloved of Me and I of you forever. Be you perfect as Myself, for you can never be apart from Me.' His Son remembers not that he replied 'I will,' though in that promise he was born\" (T-28.VI.6:3-6). Jesus takes this seriously only in the sense of reminding us that this is the source of all our internal conflict, but it is also where our true peace lies. He helps us become aware of the thoughts in our minds that we are choosing to keep us from remembering this promise. It is not that Jesus holds us accountable for this choice; he just wants to help us put an end to our pain and restore our natural state of peace to our awareness. Our lives in this world are the means our minds have chosen to keep this Identity concealed. The seriousness we accord events and problems in our lives is simply part of this defense, which includes bringing Jesus and God into our lives to fix things for us, and even to enact sanctions for our transgressions. Yet, this is all but part of our unconscious intention to validate the world and the self we have made as substitutes for truth and reality. The teachings of A Course in Miracles invite us to rise above the battleground of the world we have made so that we will be aware of another way of perceiving the world and our lives. You wound up hating your friend and becoming terrified of making promises because of the guilt over your failure to keep your promise, both ontologically and personally. The situation with your friend is really a reflection or a fragment of the much deeper self-accusation of failing to keep your promise to your Self and to God. Forgiveness and the miracle to the rescue! With Jesus leading the way, you can simply learn to smile at the insanity of thinking you sinfully betrayed God and Christ. That is totally false, and indeed, impossible. It is but a mistaken thought, not a sin, and you now can correct it by looking at it without judgment, which means with the love of Jesus next to you. You will then be more peaceful."

Because my understanding of A Course in Miracles is still very limited, this portion of the text has disrupted the peace the Course has made me aware of. This is because, as I see it, I have no holy relationships in which \"what one thinks, the other will experience with him\" (T- 22.VI.14:2). In other words, experiencing forgiveness has brought me peace in many situations, but I have no brother who shares the view the Course holds out of oneness in a present dream state. I hope I am misunderstanding this, as only the Course holds out stability, common sense truth, and peace for me.",
    "output": "Jesus is never talking about form or behavior--what bodies do with each other. He is speaking exclusively about the content in our minds--whether we have chosen the content of the ego or the content of the Holy Spirit. In the paragraphs to which you refer, Jesus is making the point that it is natural for us to perceive differences in each other (form), differences we judge as important and consequential for us, but this is natural only because we have identified with the ego thought system of separation (content). In truth, seeing each other as truly different is unnatural. Therefore he is saying that we will be better off choosing against the ego, so that we can begin to have experiences that reflect the truth of our oneness with each other, our natural state (see W-pI.161.2-4). With the ego as our teacher, we perceive our interests as separate and in conflict with those of others. But when we choose Jesus as our teacher instead, we will gradually learn how to perceive our interests as the same as everyone else's. You do not have to have a specific person in your life who shares these views with you in order to practice these teachings. You can simply be thinking of someone (past or present), interacting with someone, watching someone on television, or reading about someone. Just become aware of how you are thinking about this person. You needn't say a word. If you do not perceive your interests as separate from that person's, the relationship has been made holy, regardless of whether the other person knows it, and regardless of what that other person's thoughts are. You then will have taken a step toward experiencing oneness of being, not just of interests. When this new perception gladdens your heart and mind, Jesus states, \"you will realize that your relationship is a reflection of the union of the Creator and His Son. From loving minds there is no separation. And every thought in one brings gladness to the other because they are the same\" (T-22.VI.14:5-7). Jesus continues to unfold this experience of oneness, the extension of joy, love, and light throughout Sonship. Since our minds are joined as one, it is impossible that the gladness in your mind would not also be present in the other person's mind. That is Jesus' point, which is terribly difficult for us to grasp because we place so much trust in the testimony of our sense that tell us we are all separate from each other and that relationships are between two or more different people. But this is the revolutionary thinking Jesus is presenting in his course. Relationships begin and end in the mind as reflections of our relationship with either the ego or the Holy Spirit. That is where the healing is needed, so that we can awaken from the dream that we are separate from our Creator and Source."

    "text_input": "Q #1150: Am I correct in thinking A Course in Miracles is called a \"course\" because we all take on a compulsory \"course of thinking\" from the time we notice our separate beingness? It seems we have no choice but to set about learning ways and means to live our separate lives as best we can, in whatever circumstances we find ourselves. Survival of the fittest! So we find ourselves enmeshed in different cultures, religious traditions, and rules of behavior that best suit our needs as we see them. Our separately devised courses are clearly deeply conflicted, but we are unable to change our \"course\" because we only have our learned thinking to call on, which is how we got conflicted in the first place. Does the Course offer a real alternative--a \"course of thinking\" not based on that old, separate, self-interest pattern?",
    "output": "The term course specifically denotes the educational and academic context of the Course. It \"is arranged as a teaching device,\" as the Preface states (p. viii), and it consists therefore of a text, workbook, and manual for teachers. Jesus speaks about teaching and learning, teachers and students, a curriculum, goals and objectives of the lessons, etc. Yes, A Course in Miracles most certainly offers a real alternative. There is a section in the text with that title (T-31.IV), and one might well describe the entire Course in those terms. As you probably know, the dictation began shortly after Helen Schucman, the scribe, and her associate William Thetford agreed to rise above their separate, self-centered interests to find a better way of relating to each other and to the other people in their lives. Their agreement to join was the invitation to the source of truth in their minds, represented by Jesus and the Holy Spirit, to express this real alternative through them. Succinctly stated, A Course in Miracles teaches that the way to remember God is by undoing guilt through forgiving others. It is a lifetime's work that begins with the humble acknowledgment that we have been wrong about everything, and that even though we know of no other way, we trust that there is one, and that we will succeed in achieving its goals."

    "output": "\"His Thoughts\" refers to the extension of God, which is Christ, His Son--the capital T indicates that it refers to Christ. Jesus is using the plural form because of the context of his message in this section. The content of the statement is that Love is perfect Oneness that can never be divided or changed in any way. Contrary to what the ego says of God, Jesus is reminding us that Love never abandons. God leaving His Son is an absolute impossibility. But the Son can believe he has left his Source, even though, in truth, that is an impossibility as well. That is the Atonement principle running throughout the Course: the separation from God never truly happened."

    "text_input": "Q #1152: I have been a reader of The Science of Mind, by Ernest Holmes, and a Religious Scientist for many years. I would be very interested to hear you comment on the ideas contained in that book, and how they do or do not coincide with the Course.",
    "output": "Although there are some parallels between the ideas contained in Ernest Holmes' The Science of Mind and A Course in Miracles, such as a recognition of the power of the mind to affect its experience, including the body and its circumstances, there are some fundamental metaphysical differences that have significant implications for how we look at the world and ourselves. For Holmes, the world is God's creation and so there is an expectation that ultimately there is a harmony and abundance in the world beneath all appearances, once we recognize how our own limiting thoughts are binding us to the negative. On the relationship between God and the world, Holmes observed: \"We believe in God, the Living Spirit Almighty; one indestructible, absolute, and self-existent Cause. This One manifests Itself in and through all creation but is not absorbed by Its creation. The manifest universe is the body of God\" (italics added). Contrast this with the statement from the Course's workbook for students: \"The world was made as an attack on God. It symbolizes fear. And what is fear except love's absence? Thus the world was meant to be a place where God could enter not, and where His Son could be apart from Him. Here was perception born, for knowledge could not cause such insane thoughts\" (W-pII.3.2:1-5). As for the self we believe we are, Holmes observed that Science of Mind believes \"in the eternality, the immortality, and the continuity of the individual soul, forever and ever expanding.\" In contrast, consider the Course's observations on the individual self: \"The structure of 'individual consciousness' is essentially irrelevant because it is a concept representing the 'original error' or the 'original sin.' To study the error itself does not lead to correction, if you are indeed to succeed in overlooking the error. And it is just this process of overlooking at which the course aims ... In this world, because the mind is split, the Sons of God appear to be separate. Nor do their minds seem to be joined. In this illusory state, the concept of an 'individual mind' seems to be meaningful\" (C-in.1:4-6; C-1.2:1-3). The Course's central teaching on forgiveness is predicated on the reality of God as spirit and perfect Oneness, having absolutely nothing to do with the world of separation, form, bodies and individual selves. Forgiveness sees the world as nothing more than a feverish dream of separation, originating in our ego imagination. And we will all awaken as one mind from that dream, when we learn to forgive ourselves for what has never happened. Ernest Holmes and The Science of Mind, in contrast, could be characterized as providing us with the means to attempt to have a better, happier dream of separation, as we learn to use our split minds to manifest abundance in our lives and in our relationships. However, from the Course's perspective, so long as we remain asleep and dreaming, we can not be truly happy, and the abundance that awaits us has nothing to do with the world of form, being instead an expression of the infinite extension of love in the formless realm of spirit."

    "text_input": "Q #1153: What is meant by \"secret sins\"?",
    "output": "The \"secret sins and hidden hates\" (T-31.VIII.9:2) are the separation beliefs the mind holds, but covers over with heavy layers of denial and projection. In fact, the mind builds a defensive fortress around its plot to keep separation real in its awareness. The cement that holds the whole thing together is denial. Almost simultaneously with its choice to be separate, the mind judges the choice as sinful, feels tremendous guilt for the \"sin,\" projects the guilt out to the body, and then denies it ever did anything. It thereby denies its power to choose and, most importantly, its identity as mind. Key to the success of this plot is keeping it hidden from awareness so the mind can convince itself that it is powerless and has no choice but to accept the ego's dream of separation. Once the mind finds itself embroiled in the illusion of the body, it continues to keep its sin and guilt hidden from awareness by projecting them out and blaming external agents for its predicament. The main target of this scheme is the ego's made-up God. The ego tells a very convincing tale to get the mind off the hook and ensure that its power and, most importantly its choice, are kept hidden: God made the world and the body, tricked his creatures into sinning, and is now tracking them down to punish them with death. This insanity is the foundation of the ego's plan for salvation through sacrifice and death, sustained by guilt and fear, and designed to keep the Son of God out of his mind. Since hiding the mind's activity through denial is at the core of the ego's insanity, the Holy Spirit's curriculum of healing begins with uncovering what was hidden, and restoring to awareness the mind's power to choose. That is why so much of the teaching of the Course is devoted to describing the ego's dynamics. The key to unraveling the thick layers of denial is to train the mind to recognize the ego's antics in operation in one's life. Recognizing the mind's projections returns the source of the problem to the mind where it belongs. That is the first step in the forgiveness process. We find many passages in A Course in Miracles where Jesus exhorts us to look: \"You must look upon your illusions and not keep them hidden, because they do not rest on their own foundation. In concealment they appear to do so, and thus they seem to be self-sustained. This is the fundamental illusion on which the others rest. For beneath them, and concealed as long as they are hidden, is the loving mind that thought it made them in anger. And the pain in this mind is so apparent, when it is uncovered, that its need of healing cannot be denied. Not all the tricks and games you offer it can heal it, for here is the real crucifixion of God's Son\" (T- 13.III.7:1-6). Several layers of the mind's denial network are revealed in this passage: illusions hide behind projections that seem to have a life of their own, hidden behind the illusions is the \"loving mind,\" as well as the pain that results from the mind's decision. The intense pain of denying God's Love is hidden behind all the ego's frantic attempts (\"tricks and games\") to make the illusion of separation real and convince God's Son that happiness is possible outside of Heaven. No matter how hard the ego tries, it cannot undo the anguish of its error, and by confusing itself with the ego, the mind has crucified God's Son. This is the ego's arsenal of \"secret sins.\" Hidden beneath all the debris of the guilt-infested secret sins is the mind's best kept \"sinless secret\": the memory of God's Love. The Holy Spirit's healing process is aimed at undoing belief in the mind's secret sins so the Love that lies buried beneath them can be revealed. To that end, we are asked to look with the Holy Spirit at what has been hidden: \"Do not leave any spot of pain hidden from His light, and search your mind carefully for any thoughts you may fear to uncover [the \"sinful\" as well as the sinless]. For He will heal every little thought you have kept to hurt you and cleanse it of its littleness, restoring it to the magnitude of God\" (T-13.III.7:5-6; italics ours)."

    "text_input": "Q #1154: I have heard people say \"it makes me happy to help others.\" I never thought that there was anything \"bad\" about that statement until I made that comment and my brother said that I  was trying to please myself. I started wondering who was doing the talk, the ego or the spirit? I know that God wants us to be happy, but how can you tell if the happiness that comes from helping others comes from the ego? Can you give me your opinion?",
    "output": "Yes, God wants us to be happy, but that happiness can be found only through remembering we belong to Him and not to the world in any way (see Lesson 182 [W-pI.182]). When we forget this (which is usually all the time), we will be unhappy and then seek outside us for something that will make us happy. That could be anything at all, including helping others. But the behavior of helping others (the form) does not, in itself, tell you whether it came from your mind's choice for the ego or the Holy Spirit (the content). If it was a right-minded choice, then you would have no investment in the outcome of what you did; your inner peace and happiness would not be affected by the situation in any way; you would not take anything personally--praise or criticism; you would not perceive the situation in terms of victims and victimizers; you would not exclude anyone from the love and kindness you extended to that particular person (the content of love in your mind, not the form of the help). Jesus is teaching us in A Course in Miracles to focus on the purpose we have chosen in our minds, a choice that precedes behavioral interaction. That is the only relevant aspect of what we do--our choice of teacher. You have chosen the ego's thought system of separation if your focus is on the body--what bodies do or don't do and how that affects you. You have chosen the Holy Spirit's thought system of forgiveness if you focus on seeing shared interests, as opposed to separate interests, and you are increasingly attracted to seeing everyone as part of the Sonship, without exception."

    "text_input": "Q #1155: My question is about what appeared to be a glimpse into the deeper meaning of A Course in Miracles that I experienced. I seemed to see the world from a very different plane, but essentially I was aware of the fact that everything in this world meant nothing. It was all a cardboard cutout. One of the very strange descriptions that came to me was that there was absolutely no difference between placing my toe on the floor and the war in Iraq (or anywhere for that matter). Everything, including myself, only existed through the specialness given it. The awareness that sensed all this was not lying in the bed yet it was me. I was somehow able to switch between this awareness and the me that I knew. No longer believing in my life as I knew it, I felt a great darkness come over me. I had no alternative insight into what was real. It was then that I made a conscious decision to opt for the cardboard world I knew, as the fear of the unknown was overwhelming. I always imagined that a realization of this magnitude would be accompanied by a great sense of love or joy showing you what is your reality, but I had none of that. Is there a fear barrier that must be crossed simply through trust? And does this sound like an experience of \"vision\" or was it just the ego's meanderings?",
    "output": "This is the kind of experience addressed in the section in the text called \"Light in the Dream\" (T-18.III) (as well as in other places): \"As light comes nearer you will rush to darkness, shrinking from the truth, sometimes retreating to the lesser forms of fear, and sometimes to stark terror ... If you knew Who walks beside you on the way that you have chosen, fear would be impossible. You do not know because the journey into darkness has been long and cruel, and you have gone deep into it. A little flicker of your eyelids, closed so long, has not yet been sufficient to give you confidence in yourself, so long despised. You go toward love still hating it, and terribly afraid of its judgment upon you. And you do not realize that you are not afraid of love, but only of what you have made of it\" (T- 18.III.2:1; 3:2-6). The process of the Course is really a gentle one, but it nevertheless can lead to a sense of disorientation as we make a radical shift in our perspective of reality. Jesus explains this and reassures us: \"In the transition there is a period of confusion, in which a sense of actual disorientation may occur. But fear it not, for it means only that you have been willing to let go of your hold on the distorted frame of reference that seemed to hold your world together ... Fear not that you will be abruptly lifted up and hurled into reality. Time is kind, and if you use it on behalf of reality, it will keep gentle pace with you in your transition\" (T-16.VI.7:4-5; 8:1-2). The questioning of your reality and the world's is a necessary step in the direction of total relinquishment of your ego. A part of you (the ego part, of course) is terrified of this. \"Yet,\" Jesus says, \"in this learning is salvation born. And What you are will tell you of Itself\" (T- 31.V.17:8). When you calmly realize that your whole existence as a being in the world was made by you (the decision maker in the mind) as a defense against the truth, then you would also realize that to dismantle this powerful defense would expose the overwhelming fear that motivated you to erect it in the first place. It is at this stage of the process that we encounter the most terror, without realizing its cause. This is described rather graphically in \"The Two Worlds\" section in Chapter 18 of the text. There Jesus talks about the willingness that is needed \"to follow the Holy Spirit through seeming terror, trusting Him not to abandon you and leave you there. For it is not His purpose to frighten you, but only yours. You are severely tempted to abandon Him at the outside ring of fear, but He would lead you safely through and far beyond\" (T-18.IX.3:7-8). Jesus thus is aware of the fear and terror in our minds, but he wants to be a comforting presence to us as we go through this process, as he knows our fear and terror are unjustified. He wants to help us reach that same realization, but that means we must be patient and gentle with ourselves and allow ourselves as much time as we need to make the transition. What helps enormously is not to make a big deal about the process; after all, we are undoing only what is illusory, and restoring to our awareness only what belongs there and is natural. Our fear of loss is terribly threatening as we begin the process, but all that we will \"lose\" is our guilt, anger, anguish, and hatred, and we will become more kind, more forgiving, more compassionate, and more peaceful. That is not to be feared, but welcomed. And it will be, if we remember Who walks with us. One last point ... While it is true, within the illusion, that there is no difference between placing your toe on the floor and the war in Iraq, it is true only when you are with Jesus above the battleground. Missing this distinction could lead to denial of your experiences in the world, where differences must be respected. This crucial distinction is the basis of what Jesus teaches in Lesson 187. There he explains that \"you give but to yourself,\" and anyone who truly understands this \"must laugh at the idea of sacrifice. Nor can he fail to recognize the many forms which sacrifice may take. He laughs as well at pain and loss, at sickness and at grief, at poverty, starvation and at death. He recognizes sacrifice remains the one idea that stands behind them all, and in his gentle laughter are they healed\" (W-pI.187.6:1-5). Taken out of the context in which Jesus is presenting this lesson, these statements can make him sound cruel and insensitive. It is essential to understand, therefore, that his reference point, and yours in your experience, is the mind joined with his above the battleground."

    "text_input": "Q #1156: In regards to my brain's relationship with my mind, would it be like my brain is a receiver, and my mind is sending an infinite amount of radio signals, and that the more I forgive, the higher the quality of the signals I am actually able to receive, all the way back up the ladder; and that with less forgiveness, my radio is only capable of receiving signals of the separation?",
    "output": "You have fallen into a common confusion with your analogy, equating yourself with your body and the brain, when the purpose of A Course in Miracles is to help us identify ourselves with the mind, not the body, which is the mindless effect of our mind's choice for the ego. For you speak of the mind as sending and the brain as receiving signals, and then speak of the quality of signals that you receive being affected by whether you forgive or not, as if you were the brain, with the brain being where forgiveness is occurring. The brain is simply part of the ego's subterfuge to keep us mindless. Everything is experienced in the mind, including the seductive illusion that we are a body that experiences everything through our body's senses, with our brain. Jesus gently pokes fun at our confusion when he observes, \" ... your idea of what seeing means is tied up with the body and its eyes and brain. Thus you believe that you can change what you see by putting little bits of glass before your eyes. This is among the many magical beliefs that come from the conviction you are a body, and the body's eyes can see. You also believe the body's brain can think. If you but understood the nature of thought, you could but laugh at this insane idea. It is as if you thought you held the match that lights the sun and gives it all its warmth; or that you held the world within your hand, securely bound until you let it go. Yet this is no more foolish than to believe the body's eyes can see; the brain can think\" (W-pI.92.1:3-5; 2:1-4). The mind, not the brain, is the receiver. As Jesus explains near the end of the Course, \"consciousness [the split mind] is the receptive mechanism, receiving messages from above or below; from the Holy Spirit or the ego\" (C-1.7:3). Jesus does refer to the body as a communication medium in the text, for it merely transmits to you, the mind, what you, the mind, have given it to transmit. For the mind is both the sender and the receiver: \"Why should the body be anything to you? Certainly what it is made of is not precious. And just as certainly it has no feeling. It transmits to you [the mind] the feelings that you want. Like any communication medium the body receives and sends the messages that it is given. It has no feeling for them. All of the feeling with which they are invested is given by the sender and the receiver. The ego and the Holy Spirit both recognize this, and both also recognize that here the sender and receiver are the same [the mind]. The Holy Spirit tells you this with joy. The ego hides it, for it would keep you unaware of it. Who would send messages of hatred and attack if he but understood he sends them to himself? Who would accuse, make guilty and condemn himself?\" (T-19.IV-B.14). A little later, adding another dimension to the discussion, Jesus observes, \"the Holy Spirit, too, is a communication medium, receiving from the Father and offering His messages unto the Son. Like the ego, the Holy Spirit is both the sender and the receiver. For what is sent through Him returns to Him, seeking itself along the way, and finding what it seeks. So does the ego find the death it seeks, returning it to you\" (T-19.IV-B.17:3-6). What remains consistent throughout these various observations is that Jesus is always speaking of aspects of the mind. The body clearly plays no active role in any of this. To return to your analogy, the mind is like a person who tunes a radio, with the body/brain being the radio. The person can choose to tune into either the ego's wavelength or the Holy Spirit's, and what he will hear will be either discordant and hateful or gentle and kind, depending on which wavelength he chooses. But the radio itself experiences nothing, and makes no choice about which wavelength will be tuned in. Where the analogy breaks down is that the form of what is heard may be no different on either wavelength. For example, the same powerful symphony, or perhaps a news report, could be coming through the radio on both wavelengths, but the person may hear it as disturbing and unsettling if he's tuned into the ego's wavelength, while he may hear it as hopeful and loving if he's tuned into the Holy Spirit's wavelength. In that sense, the ego and the Holy Spirit are more like alternative filters through which the broadcast is perceived. By the way, the radio would never be capable of receiving only the ego's signals, as you wonder, for the mind/person in any moment can choose to change to the Holy Spirit's broadcast, and this does not depend on what he has tuned into in the previous moment or series of moments, for however long they may seem to extend. He just needs to change the dial. However, if he's used to tuning into the ego's wavelength, over time he may forget that the Holy Spirit's wavelength is also available to him and he'll act as if he has no choice, as if the radio can only pick up one wavelength. But in any moment, when he wants to remember, all he needs to do is change from the ego's wavelength to the Holy Spirit's, and his perception and his experience will shift."

    "text_input": "Q #1157: The purpose of the Course seems to be revelation or knowledge, which I've always assumed to be the same as the mystical experience, without which the journey is useless. Jesus also says in his course, \"When you have seen your brother as yourself, you will be released to knowledge ... \" (T-13.VIII.8:1). Surely most people, at some point in their lives, have seen someone as themselves, if only for a moment ... and not just those who have experienced revelation.",
    "output": "The term knowledge in A Course in Miracles is really a synonym for Heaven, the state of perfect Oneness. That is our true and natural state as God's Son; and although we believe we rejected it and made up another self as a substitute, we are assured through the Atonement principle that we never truly left that state and therefore Heaven's Oneness was never changed. Yet, our work with the Course is focused on a goal that will leave us at Heaven's gate, so to speak, where God Himself will then take the next step, lifting us back unto Himself. Thus, Jesus tells us: \"Knowledge is not the motivation for learning this course. Peace is. This the prerequisite for knowledge only because those who are in conflict are not peaceful, and peace is the condition of knowledge because it is the condition of the Kingdom ... Knowledge is His Will. If you are opposing His Will, how can you have knowledge?\" (T-8.I.1:1-3, 7-8). Jesus reminds us of this later in the text: \"Forget not that the motivation for this course is the attainment and the keeping of the state of peace. Given this state the mind is quiet, and the condition in which God is remembered is attained\" (T-24.in.1:1-2). The section in Chapter 13 from which you quoted is entitled \"From Perception to Knowledge\" (T-13.VIII), and there Jesus is teaching us that our perception of ourselves and others as separate is what keeps us from the state of knowledge, the state of perfect oneness. Thus, if we free ourselves of the illusion that we are separate, then the oneness of the Sonship will be the lens through which we perceive ourselves and everyone else. When this is our only perception, we are released to knowledge. We begin this transition, however, by learning to perceive that we all share the same interests, seeing others as ourselves."

    "text_input": "Q #1158: What is A Course in Miracles' view on reincarnation? Is reincarnation considered an illusion? What happens when you die and you haven't completed the goal of \"chipping away\" at the illusions and defenses so that you possess a mindset that reflects Heaven or stays in Heaven?",
    "output": "In keeping with its teaching that there is no life outside Heaven, the Course does not make a strong case for or against reincarnation: \"There is no life outside of Heaven ... In any state apart from Heaven life is illusion. At best it seems like life; at worst, like death. Yet both are judgments on what is not life, equal in their inaccuracy and lack of meaning\" (T-23.II.19:1, 3-5). Based on this fundamental principle of the Course's teaching, the manual answers the question of reincarnation directly: \"In the ultimate sense, reincarnation is impossible. There is no past or future, and the idea of birth into a body has no meaning either once or many times. Reincarnation cannot, then, be true in any real sense\" (M-24.1:1-3). Clearly, then, the idea of reincarnation is part of the illusory belief system of the ego. The mind that chooses illusion also choses to identify with a body that lives and dies, once or many times; it does not matter. The important thing to consider is the mind's choice to believe in illusion rather than truth. That choice is made outside of time and space. It precedes the birth of the body and is unaffected by its death. If the body is the projection of the mind's belief in separation, the only thing that makes the body real is the continued belief in separation. Having chosen the body as its identity, the mind then convinces itself that the body acts independently in a linear process of \"chipping away\" that will ultimately have an effect on the mind. That is impossible. The mind confuses cause and effect as a defense against its own power to choose truth over illusion. The only way out of the illusion of the life and death dilemma is for the mind to learn to recognize the painful effects of its choice, until it decides unequivocally for truth. Until it thus awakens from the nightmare of separation, the mind just keeps on dreaming. It dreams it is a body, has adventures, lives, dies, and lives again. Just as your body remains asleep in your bed whether you have a long, adventurous, nocturnal dream, jumping from one country to another, or a simple dream about a blue cat, so it is with the mind that dreams the dream of separation. It does not go out of itself. Thus, the mind's dream of life in a body is no more real than the nocturnal adventures of the blue cat. Nothing happens when you die because nothing happens when you live, as long as the \"you\" is the body. Each time the mind is willing to recognize itself as cause, it weakens belief in the body. As long as it is attracted to the separation thought, it establishes the \"reality\" of the body, birth, death, and rebirth. So while the mind keeps on dreaming, it keeps on choosing. That is all it ever does; it is all that ever happens. Being willing not to deny the disastrous effects of its choice for separation, the mind will ultimately decide against it. Thus, the practice of forgiveness remains the only path to awakening and ending the cycle of illusory lives. It is the alternative to reincarnation.

In some passages, A Course in Miracles seems to suggest that they are one and the same; yet, if there is a Holy Trinity in Heaven, does this refer to some concept of the Holy Spirit as having a role or function that is different from the One Son, or Christ? Since Heaven is non-dualistic, I recognize that these terms are just concepts to help us understand the non-separated state. However, I would benefit from your explanation of the distinction that the Course is using with the term Holy Spirit and the Son or Christ, and what is actually meant by these terms as part of the Holy Trinity.",
    "output": "Strictly speaking, there is no Trinity. In Heaven there is only God. \"The first in time means nothing, but the First in eternity is God the Father, Who is both First and One. Beyond the First there is no other, for there is no order, no second or third, and nothing but the First\" (T- 14.IV.1:7,8). Christ is defined as \"the extension of the Love and the Loveliness of God, as perfect as His Creator and at peace with Him\" (T-11.IV.7:5); yet, to quote a well-known line in the workbook, \"nowhere does the Father end, the Son begin as something separate from Him\" (W-pI.132.12:4). Christ is not a being apart from the Father. The Holy Spirit is metaphorically described in A Course in Miracles as God's Answer to the separation, but there is no detailed explanation of the genesis of the Holy Spirit. Some descriptions offered are as follows: \"The Holy Spirit is the only part of the Holy Trinity that has a symbolic function ... the Healer, the Comforter and the Guide\" (T-5.I.4:1-2). \"The Holy Spirit is the Christ Mind which is aware of the knowledge that lies beyond perception\" (T-5.I.5:1). \"He is part of the Holy Trinity, because His Mind is partly yours and also partly God's. This needs clarification, not in statement but in experience\" (T-5.III.1:4-5). It seems therefore that the Holy Spirit is spoken of only in relation to the separation, which we know is illusory and never happened. But Jesus also teaches that when the dream of separation is over, the Holy Spirit will \"return to the eternal formlessness of God\" (C-6.5:8). In trying to fill in the blanks and even formulate a theology, it is important to keep in mind how the Course uses language, and related to that, its intention of offering a correction of what it sees as the mistakes of traditional Christianity. As you probably have noticed in our answers on this Service, we like to refer students to chapter 2 of Kenneth's Few Choose to Listen (Volume Two of The Message of A Course in Miracles), where they will find a comprehensive explanation of the Course's use of words and terms. Equally important, as you allude to in your question, there is no way we can understand the Godhead or Heaven while we are still choosing to keep ourselves separate from it by believing that we truly exist here as separate individuals. A sample of many such acknowledgments in the Course: \"Through our creations we extend our love, and thus increase the joy of the Holy Trinity. You do not understand this, because you who are God's Own treasure do not regard yourself as valuable. Given this belief, you cannot understand anything ... Truth can only be experienced. It cannot be described and it cannot be explained. I can make you aware of the conditions of truth, but the experience is of God. Together we can meet its conditions, but truth will dawn upon you of itself\" (T-8.VI.8:9-11; 9:8-11)."

    "text_input": "Q #1160: Where does the Course stand in regard to the ideas of twinflame, soul mate, and karmic relationships? Are those concepts true, or do they really just add to the belief of separation among brothers and special relationships?",
    "output": "A Course in Miracles does not say whether these concepts are true or not. On the level of absolute truth, of course, there are no relationships, because reality is non-dualistic, a state of perfect Oneness. In our separated state within the dream, though, we obviously have relationships; and the Course helps us realize that the only meaningful aspect of relationships is the purpose we have given them in our minds--either the ego's or the Holy Spirit's. As we explain in #320, the key aspects of a special relationship--which means the ego purpose of separation has been given it--are dependency, completion, and needs. Thus, the feeling that someone is your soul mate could reflect the ego's purpose of reinforcing your belief that you are separate, incomplete, and have needs that must be met, or it could reflect your desire to undo these belief, and that this person will be your partner in the forgiveness process. It can be a right- minded or wrong-minded attraction. With regard to karma, one of the major differences between that approach and the Course's is that the Course sees time as holographic, not linear, which means there can be no causal connection between the past and our present experience--unless our minds deliberately put one there. Another point of difference is that since \"projection makes perception\" and the world is \"the outside picture of an inward condition\" (T-21.in.1:1,5), we do nothing to the world and the world does nothing to us. A comprehensive view of this issue can be found in the following Questions: #332, #363, #514i, #516, and #577."

    "text_input": "Q #1161: What does A Course in Miracles mean about relinquishing all other goals except salvation? Are we not meant to use our gifts? Are we not meant to cherish the goal of manifesting our gifts and using our talent?",
    "output": "Interestingly, in the passage you are referring to, Jesus describes these other goals as ones \"you have invented for yourself\" (W-pI.65.1:5; italics added). That means they have nothing to do with our true Identity, and instead pertain to the self we made as replacement for the Self God created. As God created us, our true and only function is creating in Heaven (W-pI.192.1). What we regard as our gifts and our talents are part of a substitute, ego-based identity. Once we understand and accept ourselves in that light, we can then ask Jesus or the Holy Spirit to help us use our so-called gifts and talents for the purpose of salvation, rather than for their original purpose of keeping us separate from our identity as spirit. Then, our only purpose will be forgiveness (W-pI.192.2-3), \"the only function meaningful in time. It is the means the Holy Spirit uses to translate specialness from sin into salvation\" (T-25.VI.5:3-4). Talents are very much an individual thing, setting people apart from one another--the ones who have them from the ones who do not; the specially gifted from the modestly gifted, and so on. This, despite the fact that many people use their talents in the service of others, or as members of teams and groups. The Course is not saying not to develop our talents, but to become aware of our purpose for doing so, as would be the case with anything of the body and the world. As students of A Course in Miracles, we can learn to regard them simply as part of the curriculum our teacher of forgiveness can use to help us learn that we are all the same in sharing the same purpose, and ultimately that we are all the same as God's one Son."

    "text_input": "Q #1162: What is the meaning of humor? Does it have anything to do with joy, or is it just part of the illusion?",
    "output": "Humor is just part of the illusion and, as part of the illusion, it can be a complex topic, one that has been analyzed and studied extensively over the years to determine what makes something funny or humorous. Freud, in one of the earlier analyses of humor, theorized that it always involves tension reduction or release. From the perspective of A Course in Miracles, guilt is the sole source of tension, and so things which release or reduce guilt may be experienced as funny or humorous. But in the end, as with all things of the world, humor's meaning depends on whether it serves a right-minded or a wrong-minded purpose. In the service of the ego, humor is a vehicle for attack, as can be easily seen in mean-spirited attempts to get a laugh by putting others down, where an individual or group is targeted as the butt of the joke, such as ethnic and racist jokes, political jokes, and humor that plays upon the \"battle of the sexes.\" Ego humor can be cruel and vicious, always coming at the expense of someone seen as outside of oneself or one's self-identified group, and so always reinforcing the perception of separation and differences. The unconscious motivation behind the ego's use of humor would always be to see guilt outside oneself. Expanding on Freud's thesis, the tension reduction in the ego's humor would only be a reduction in experienced guilt as it is projected onto another. And the relief from such amusement would only be temporary, since the underlying guilt has not really been addressed and released. Right-minded use of humor, in contrast, either minimizes or makes light of differences, and although its form may at times appear similar to the ego's, its content is gentle and its purpose is to help us not to take ourselves quite so seriously. Rather than laughing derisively at others, we learn to smile at ourselves. Drawing again on Freud's tension reduction/release hypothesis, it could be said that right-minded humor involves an actual release from guilt, as our investment in separation is relinquished in that moment of transcending the ego's artificial barriers and divisions. The laughter that may accompany this humor is light and joyful. Jesus displays such a right-minded sense of humor throughout the Course, as in \"The 'Hero' of the Dream\" (T-27.VIII), where he describes our so-called life in the body, pointing out our silly beliefs, which we take so seriously. For example, few topics are more serious and guilt-inducing to most of us, yet Jesus refers to money simply as \"little metal discs or paper strips the world proclaims as valuable and real\" (T-27.VIII.2:2). And he regards the ego thought system and its ramifications simply as \"a tiny, mad idea, at which the Son of God remembered not to laugh,\" and \"a joke\" (T-27.VIII.6:2,5). His words are not meant to attack our beliefs, but only to suggest a more light-hearted perspective that will allow us to move towards acknowledging and then looking beyond our guilt, thereby releasing it, rather than attempting to place it outside ourselves, as our egos would have us do, where its reality is never questioned. Humor and laughter have no purpose in Heaven, for their right-minded function is corrective, that is, they serve to lighten and eventually cast off the burden of guilt that we have foolishly made real and taken upon ourselves, while we remain too afraid of the joy without contrast that is our real inheritance. As Jesus explains, \"This is the way salvation works. As you step back, the light in you steps forward and encompasses the world. It heralds not the end of sin in punishment and death. In lightness and in laughter is sin gone, because its quaint absurdity is seen. It is a foolish thought, a silly dream, not frightening, ridiculous perhaps, but who would waste an instant in approach to God Himself for such a senseless whim?\" (W-pI.156.6). And so, \"the world will end in joy, because it is a place of sorrow. When joy has come, the purpose of the world has gone. The world will end in peace, because it is a place of war. When peace has come, what is the purpose of the world? The world will end in laughter, because it is a place of tears. Where there is laughter, who can longer weep? And only complete forgiveness brings all this to bless the world. In blessing it departs, for it will not end as it began\" (M-14.5:1- 8)."

How exactly can your studying of the Course result in a traumatic experience? Which, more precisely, are the early sections and which the later ones, that Jesus is referring to in the text?

That's not a pretty sight in our minds, but we will never be able to truly get beyond the ego and all its hate and selfishness without looking at it and humbly admitting we were wrong in wanting the special identity the ego offered in place of our true Identity as Christ. We must learn how to do that, trusting Jesus' word more and more that we will not be punished--even annihilated as the ego warns us for having made a substitute for God's Love. We must practice every day how to shift the purpose of our lives and our relationships from the ego's to the Holy Spirit's; but we cannot do that without seeing-- sometimes shockingly so-- the extent of our investment in the ego and how we manifest the ego's madness of separation 24 hours a day, usually. The point is, we have covered all of that over because we were convinced that unspeakably horrific things would happen if we ever remembered we have a mind and then would go back there and look at what we chose. There is such fear buried there that if we were to approach God directly, we would surely be thrown into a disabling panic. We need to approach God indirectly, through forgiveness and a relationship with Jesus or the Holy Spirit first, because of all the distorted notions we have implanted in our minds about Who God is and what we can expect of Him when we meet Him face to face. Jesus discusses this indirect approach in Chapter 14 of the text in the section called \"The Conditions of Learning\" (T-14.I). Earlier in Chapter 12 he tells us: \"You cannot lay aside the obstacles to real vision without looking upon them, for to lay aside means to judge against. If you will look, the Holy Spirit will judge, and He will judge truly. Yet He cannot shine away what you keep hidden, for you have not offered it to Him and He cannot take it from you. We are therefore embarking on an organized, well-structured and carefully planned program aimed at learning how to offer to the Holy Spirit everything you do not want. He knows what to do with it. You do not understand how to use what He knows. Whatever is given Him that is not of God is gone. Yet you must look at it yourself in perfect willingness, for otherwise His knowledge remains useless to you. Surely He will not fail to help you, since help is His only purpose. Do you not have greater reason for fearing the world as you perceive it, than for looking at the cause of fear and letting it go forever?\" (T-12.II.9:6-8; 10) This is the process Jesus wants us to focus on and not slip past, thinking we are already too spiritually advanced to have to engage in such work, and that we don't need any help."

I am on Chapter 25 now and I get confused as to who my brother is. Is it myself? I know this sounds preposterous but I really do not know.",
    "output": "The source of the physical universe, including all the bodies it contains, is the thought of separation taken seriously in the one mind of the Sonship. This thought gives birth to the brotherhood of all the separated ones. From within the dream of separation there appear to be a multitude of separate bodies living separate lives, all of whom are referred to in A Course in Miracles as \"your brother\" because they are split off parts of the one mind. That is what is meant when Jesus tells us: \"One brother is all brothers. Every mind contains all minds, for every mind is one. Such is the truth\" (W-pI.161.4:1-3). Thus, everyone is your brother. Everything the Course teaches about the practice of forgiveness in relationship with \"your brother\" applies to everyone. As long as the split mind perceives other bodies as separate from oneself, there is need for forgiveness. What simplifies the practice of forgiveness is its universal applicability. Every encounter is an opportunity to see the mind's choice for separation reflected in the thoughts and judgments projected onto others. In the manual, Jesus tells us there are no accidents, no chance encounters, no strangers (M-3.1-2). Your brother is the person you are with at the moment: \"[a stranger] in an elevator, a child who is not looking where he is going running into an adult 'by chance,' two students 'happening' to walk home together\" (M-3.2:2). To love a brother who is a seeming stranger is to recognize that any perceived differences are irrelevant in the face of the underlying oneness that unites every fragmented part of the Sonship. Every brother has a mind that holds the ego's lie of separation, the Holy Spirit's memory of truth, and the power to choose between them. To love a brother as one's self is to recognize that perceiving him as separate is a projection of the mind. When the mind chooses separation, it projects guilt for this choice onto the body--one's own, as well as that of others--and then mistakenly believes that external agents are responsible for what is experienced in the illusion. Thus, in the practice of the Course, to love a brother is to forgive him for what he did not do (T- 17.III.1:5). He may attack in a hateful, hurtful way, but he cannot take away the peace that abides in the mind. That is relinquished only by the choice to identify with the ego rather than the Holy Spirit. To speak of separated parts is to speak in dualistic terms that apply within the dream of separation. In reality there are no \"brothers\"; only the one Son joined with the Father in a oneness that cannot be expressed in the language of separation. Jesus uses dualistic language in the Course because we believe in the duality of separation. He teaches forgiveness that we may undo this belief by learning that we are minds, not bodies. To that end, Jesus tells us: \"Think [of your brother] as a mind in which illusions still persist, but as a mind which brother is to you. He is not brother made by what he dreams, nor is his body, 'hero' of the dream, your brother. It is his reality that is your brother, as is yours to him. Your mind and his are joined in brotherhood\" (T-28.IV.3:3-6). The process of learning that as minds, we are all the same will lead to the awareness that we are all one."

However, The Song of Prayer states, \"The secret of true prayer is to forget the things you think you need ... in prayer you overlook your specific needs as you see them, and let them go into God's Hands\" (S-1.I.4:1,3). This seems to be a bit of a contradiction. Can you please clarify? A: About the \"Rules for Decision\" passage ... At the beginning of the preceding paragraph, Jesus explained that our major problem is that we first determine what our problem is, and then we ask for help. Thus, in the passage you quoted, he is teaching us not to decide on our own. He wants us to learn that ultimately we have only one problem, which is that we chose the ego instead of the Holy Spirit. So by not assuming we know the cause of our unrest or agitation, we are giving Jesus a chance to teach us where to look for the real cause: the decision we are making",
    "output": "in our minds to uphold the ego thought system. It is important to realize that throughout the \"Rules for Decision\" section, he is talking about content, not form. Thus, when he asks us to think about the kind of day we want, he is talking about whether we want our day to go the ego's way, or his way. He is not talking about having a successful day in terms of winning the lottery or something like that. How we experience our day will correlate directly with our decision to choose the ego as our teacher--more guilt, fear, specialness, and separation--or Jesus as our teacher--more peace, compassion, kindness, and love. This parallels what he teaches in The Song of Prayer pamphlet. Prior to the passage you quote, he reminds us that he made a few statements in the text and workbook (very few, actually) where he instructed us to ask the Holy Spirit for specific help, and that we would receive specific answers to our requests. Yet, in two lessons he emphasizes that there is only one problem and one answer (W-pI.79,80). \"In prayer this is not contradictory,\" he states in The Song of Prayer (S-1.I.2:3); and this is because prayer is a process--like a ladder with rungs. On the bottom rungs, all that we are comfortable with is asking for specifics, which is the point of Jesus' statement in Lesson 161: \"The mind that taught itself to think specifically can no longer grasp abstraction in the sense that it is all-encompassing\" (W-pI.161.4:7). As we grow spiritually, however, we become less and less attracted to the specifics, and more and more attracted to the love itself that is the substance of the answer. This is characteristic of the gentle nature of the Course's healing process. \"You cannot be asked to accept answers which are beyond the level of need that you can recognize. Therefore, it is not the form of the question that matters, nor how it is asked. The form of the answer, if given by God, will suit your need as you see it. This is merely an echo of the reply of His Voice. The real sound is always a song of thanksgiving and of Love\" (S-I.1.2:5-9)."

    "text_input": "Q #1166: Can the ego learn?",
    "output": "No. The ego is the thought of separation taken seriously. It is the effect of a decision made by the part of the mind that chooses (sometimes called the decision maker). As such, it does not learn. What \"learns\" is the decision-maker mind that is able to experience the effects of its choice, so where it chose wrongly it can choose again. When A Course in Miracles says the ego can learn (T-4.I.2:13), it refers to this decision-making part of the mind. In deciding to identify with the ego thought system, the mind confuses itself with the body, denies its power to choose, and becomes oblivious to its natural condition. It uses the body as the depository of its guilt, proving that the sin of separation has had serious consequences. Thus the mind reinforces its belief in guilt and in separation. The goal of the Holy Spirit's curriculum of forgiveness is to teach the mind that separation not only had no effects, it never even happened (M-2.2) When the mind accepts the Holy Spirit's goal, the body serves as a mirror to reflect back the choice it made and subsequently denied. Learning to choose again is the only learning that ever occurs. It is more a process of remembering than learning. Each time the mind decides to remember its power to choose and chooses the Holy Spirit, it unlearns the ego-identity and weakens belief in the separation. Eventually the mind is healed of the belief in separation, and the memory of God returns to awareness: \"By healing you [the mind] learn of wholeness, and by learning of wholeness you learn to remember God\" (T-7.IV.4:3)."

Several have noticed and commented on what a \"forgiving\" person I am. However, when someone \"attacks\" my loved ones, my full defense mechanisms come on for their sake. Try as I might, I can't look at them as looking for love when they are \"hurting\" my family or friends. Can you suggest any readings from A Course in Miracles that could help me in this aspect? I need to see my loved ones as safe as I see myself! Why can't I? A: Most students run into what you are experiencing. You seem to be heading in the right direction; you just need to continue the process of generalizing what you have learned. The key principles to keep in focus as you practice are that differences are not real, and that there is no hierarchy of illusions or attack. When you truly see another's attack as a call for love, you are no longer you; you have become the extension of love, not one person forgiving another person. And since love is all-inclusive, when you are identified with love, everyone else, without exception, would also be enclosed in that circle of invulnerability and innocence. If, therefore, you perceive your loved ones as vulnerable and victimized, it is because you have left your right mind and once again identified with the thought system of vulnerability and victimization--a thought system that has you project your guilt and see it in the form of guilty victimizers harming innocent victims. Then, in league with the ego, you will believe in a hierarchy of attack, and forgiveness will be harder in some situations than in others (see T-12.VII.1). To the ego, relationships are between persons, while Jesus teaches that relationships are only in the mind, because there is no one outside the mind. That is tremendously difficult to grasp, but it is essential to keep in focus in order to avoid making differences important and then using them as means to maintain the reality of separation, often under the guise of being loving and protective. When you choose against the ego, you are choosing against separation in all its forms. As you learn to generalize, you will gradually perceive everyone the same way: as minds always choosing between illusion and truth (T-12.VI.6:4-6)--both victims and victimizers are calling out for love. You would then gradually focus less and less on bodies and specific identities (family, friend, stranger, etc.). This is not easy to do because of our obsession with form at the expense of content (see T-14.X.7-9; T-22.III.6). So try to get past the form to the content when thinking about your loved ones. They, too, are either calling out for love or expressing it. This in no way means that you must sit back and allow them to be attacked. We are talking only about your thinking, not your behavior. Seeing attack as a call for love does not mean that you should never try to stop someone from hurting you or your loved ones. In your right mind you may be guided to do or say something, or to do or say nothing, but it would not be you making the decision.",

    "text_input": "Q #1168: As I understand it, A Course in Miracles describes a holy relationship as two people extending the Christ inside, joining with each other. If I have it correct, does this mean that both people need to be at this level of understanding about the true Self inside of them for the holy relationship to exist?",
    "output": "A holy relationship exists whenever anyone makes a decision in the mind to shift the purpose of the relationship from the ego's goal of specialness to the Holy Spirit's goal of healing. Since the problem of specialness/separation exists in the mind, the relationship is healed when the mind chooses the Holy Spirit instead of the ego. Nothing happens between two people because bodies do not join (T-18.VI.3:1). It is sufficient that one person choose to identify with the right mind for every relationship to be transformed; those with whom one is closely associated (family, friends), along with those who are seeming strangers. This all-inclusiveness distinguishes the holy relationship from the special relationship that is exclusive by its very nature. The Sonship shares the memory of God and of the true Self held in the part of the mind (right mind) symbolized by the Holy Spirit. Thus is everyone present when anyone chooses to identify with the right mind. That is why Jesus tells us we were with him when he accepted the Atonement (T-19.IV-B.6:5). The other person need not be aware of the shift in the relationship from special to holy. Just as everyone will ultimately accept the Atonement that has already been accomplished, everyone will accept the holy relationship. We cannot speak of the Christ as two people, even in the best of circumstances. The term refers to the non-dualistic nature of God's one Son. There is not a true Self within separate individuals, but one true Self shared by the seeming fragments of the Sonship. The oneness of God's Son cannot be understood from the perspective of the duality of separation: \"On this side of the bridge you see the world of separate bodies, seeking to join each other in separate unions and to become one by losing. When two individuals seek to become one, they are trying to decrease their magnitude. Each would deny his power, for the separate union excludes the universe\" (T-16.VI.5:2-4). The holy relationship cannot, then, exist between two individuals as a special union. If one brother is perfectly forgiven all brothers are forgiven, because each relationship contains them all. Until \"not one spot of darkness still remains\" (T-31.VIII.12:5) to obscure the vision of the face of Christ, we are asked to look at the shadows in every special relationship without judgment, recognizing in them the mind's projected fear of its true Identity. Although it is not the vision of the Christ, every step in forgiveness is enough to make a relationship holy because it returns attention to the mind where the problem of specialness can be healed. Through the practice of forgiveness, guilt is eventually undone, which means the end of projection and the perception of differences. It leads to the moment when a brother is seen as the mirror of one's self; the concept of a separate self is set aside, all judgment is relinquished, and the veil is lifted from the face of Christ (T-31.VII.8:4-7). The mind's return to the awareness of this non-dualistic Identity as Christ is the ultimate goal of the Course."

To add spice to my stew, the head of the family studied A Course in Miracles for several years. But now he says things like, \"I don't know why I ever studied that.\" As a Course student myself, I realize that my family's political anger is simply projected self-hatred, and I find myself wanting them to recognize this. They raise political issues for discussion quite often and I suppose from my responses that I appear politically apathetic or extreme in terms of valuing spiritual solutions over \"real world\"  solutions. And so, I often do not say much at all. Quoting from the Course or taking the stance that \"there is no one out there\" feels egotistical to me. There is no sign that any of my family looks to me for leadership--no desire for a teacher of God to come into an intractable situation to offer hope. And yet I feel more like I'm repressing myself than that I'm practicing faith and patience with them. I don't feel open minded as much as I feel that there is no use in saying anything. My question is: why am I doing this?",
    "output": "It sounds like what you really want to know is why you are experiencing pain over this situation and conflict about how to handle it. Remember that A Course in Miracles makes it clear that all pain comes from guilt and that the source of all guilt is our belief in separation (T- 15.V.2:5). Thus, it is not the fact that your family holds a world view that differs from your own that is causing you pain. Rather, your pain stems from the fact that you judge them for it, thereby reinforcing your belief in separation and triggering your guilt. By starting with the assumption that they would be better off if they came around to your way of seeing the world, you ensure that no matter how you respond to them on the level of form, in your mind the content will be attack. And because this attack thought feels valid and justified, you will sense that by not expressing it to them, you are repressing yourself. But as you stated, they are not asking you to teach them the Course or a more spiritual way of looking at the world. In fact, it sounds as if that is the last thing they want. Therefore, your wishing that they would look at things differently is to fall into the same futile trap that they are caught in by their political anger. In essence you are all saying, \"I would be happy if only someone else would change.\" Part of you is aware of this dynamic, which is why spouting Course platitudes to them would feel egotistical to you. The fact that you know this, and yet still feel a desire to change them, can help you empathize with how real and justified their political rage must feel to them. Because the head of your family is a former Course student, part of using this situation as your own classroom might include asking yourself whether his rejection of the Course feels like a rejection of you. You are likely to have this thought if, in fact, your ability to feel love for him is in any way predicated on the choices he makes. Basically, the key to feeling better about all this is to realize that, as the Course says repeatedly, the peace of God is within you. Your family's choices and attitudes can have no power to take that peace away from you unless you want it to be taken away. They actually are offering you a wonderful opportunity to ask the Holy Spirit to help you look without judgment and learn to come from a truly loving place. When you do that, you will know what your family really wants from you when they express their anger at governmental leaders. And then your response might take many different forms including agreeing with them and allowing them to tell you all about their rage. Ironically, by not telling them that they are wrong, you might actually demonstrate that they are wrong about the one thing that really matters--teaching simply by your compassionate presence that love does exist and that they are deserving of it."

    "text_input": "Q #1171: I have a problem in my life that I was hoping that you could comment on. I sometimes have feelings of extreme happiness and bliss when I am in my right mind and feel truly joined with others. But it seems that some women mistake my kindness and genuine friendliness for \"attraction\" and romantic flirtation. I sometimes wonder why the Holy Spirit would let this happen when all that I am doing is trying to be who He would have me be. Should I feel confident that when the person is ready to accept the genuine truth of my actions that their misperception of my behavior will be corrected? I feel paranoid all the time now about being nice and friendly to others because I feel misinterpreted and misunderstood. Or am I possibly just maybe unconsciously setting myself up to be a victim of others' misperceptions and then blaming the Holy Spirit for it? A: It may be helpful to remember that we are not responsible for how others choose to perceive us. But we are responsible for our own reactions to others' perceptions of us. And we only ever feel the way we do because we want to (T-21.II.2).",
    "output": "You are correct in your suspicion that perhaps you are unconsciously setting yourself up for conflict and then seeking to pin the blame on the Holy Spirit. For the Holy Spirit does not intervene in the world, and so it would be a misperception of Him to believe that He somehow allows things to happen. He also is not concerned with how we behave in the world, because He is not fooled, as our minds are, into believing we are bodies or that there is an external world. And so we would also be misperceiving Him if we believed that He cares about how we seem to act towards others. His only concern is how we perceive others whom we still see as separate from ourselves. The Holy Spirit, by the way, is not upset by nor does He blame you for your misperceptions of Him. His only function, in every situation and circumstance, is to remind us of another way of perceiving that does not reinforce guilt and pain and conflict. As Jesus points out: \"The Voice of the Holy Spirit does not command, because It is incapable of arrogance. It does not demand, because It does not seek control. It does not overcome, because It does not attack. It merely reminds. It is compelling only because of what It reminds you of. It brings to your mind the other way, remaining quiet even in the midst of the turmoil you may make\" (T-5.II.7.1-6). If you simply allow yourself to be a channel for the Holy Spirit's Love, which in this world would be Love's reflection, expressed as forgiveness (W-pI.60.1:4-5), or nonjudgmental acceptance, you will find that you are not concerned with how others perceive you. And it is only the guilt in your own mind that is being triggered by how these women perceive you. But that is not a sin and, in fact, your reaction to them offers you a good learning opportunity. For the only real healing any of us needs is to recognize that our own guilt over separation is not real, because the separation could never happen. Whenever that guilt is released, we will not react to how others perceive us, for in that moment our ego has disappeared and there is nothing within us that can react to or judge another."

Does this mean that 6 billion or so separate egos must come to the truth separately? Doesn't that mean that each ego is in fact separate in a sense? Connected with that thought ... Considering that the whole point of this \"life\" is, essentially, to escape it, would there be any point in having children? It seems that this only adds to the splintered mind and suffering. Does each new life in this world have the responsibility to free itself?",
    "output": "Your first question is one that has crossed the mind of just about every person who has taken up A Course in Miracles. It is an issue, though, only because the framework of all our questioning is that of linear time. We are programmed to perceive everything in terms of time and space, and therefore it is almost inevitable that we will misinterpret, or not understand at all, what Jesus teaches us about the mind, which is outside time and space. Jesus' objective in the lessons he gives us in the workbook is to help us become reacquainted with ourselves as decision-making minds so that we will perceive everything from a more helpful perspective. You might find it helpful to read our answer to #585, which discusses this problem, and also refers you to earlier answers pertaining to the issue you raise. With regard to whether there is any point in having children, the answer would revolve around purpose. The decision can be wrong-minded (to reinforce separation and specialness) or right- minded (to learn forgiveness in the parent-child relationship). We have expanded discussions of this important topic in our answers to earlier questions --#232 and #411."

    "text_input": "Q #1173: Recently I visited several Internet forums on different subjects. People seemed to \"hit out\" at each other and argue so much, it reminded me very much of the Course's statement that this world is already an attack on the Son of God, made by himself. Since we regard the world we are living in as our \"lives,\" does it mean, in the Course's perception of the world, that the very fact that we are \"living\" in this world is already an attack on ourselves? In other words, by \"incarnating\" into flesh and body are we being \"auto-aggressive\"?",
    "output": "Yes. The attack on the Son of God is the mind's decision to be separate, and to identify with a body living in the world. The mind defends its choice by projecting out its guilt in countless scenarios for wars of opposition, not least among them, the many battles among students of the Course. Nothing misses the point more blatantly than the compulsion to defend a distinctive position regarding the teachings of A Course in Miracles. It proves that there is nothing the ego cannot use to defend separation. But then, there is nothing the Holy Spirit cannot use to heal the mind of belief in separation. And so, the world that the ego made as an attack (W-pII.3.2:1) can become a classroom for the Holy Spirit's lessons of forgiveness. The goal of the classroom is to learn that neither the attack, nor the ensuing battles between opposing forces of any kind have any real effect on the mind's ability to choose peace. What takes the punch out of the attack is not judging it as sinful, because it has no effect; an illusory attack has brought forth an illusory world. The lessons of forgiveness begin with willingness to look at the many forms of attack and judgment that present themselves in the course of living in this world, and seeing in them the reflection of the mind's choice to defend separation. In the case of \"warring students,\" one might find judgments founded on the perception of these students as sinful wrong-doers. Missing the point is not cause for condemnation and exclusion, however eager the ego may be to make its case. It is a call for love expressed in discord among students and is no different from the call for love of one who judges them. The important thing is to hear the call in oneself along with that of someone else, judging neither. This brings the mind in alignment with the Holy Spirit, transforms the battlefield into a classroom, and the attack into an opportunity. Practicing in this way with every situation that presents itself is how the mind is healed of the mistaken belief in the seemingly devastating effects of the Son of God's attack upon himself."

    "text_input": "Q #1174: In Ken and Gloria's book The Most Commonly Asked Questions About A Course in Miracles, they discuss the possibility that someone can be threatened by our \"peace.\" They were clarifying the line in the Course that says we know we are truly at peace when \"all those who meet or even think of you share in your perfect peace\" (T-14.XI.5:2) with the anger directed toward Jesus. Ken and Gloria said that in order to become threatened by our peace someone else would have to have first \"experienced it as real and then become threatened by it.\" Does this mean that the person who becomes threatened senses that we do not want to compete with them but only want to be friends with them? Do they detect a sense of peace with ourselves? I just do not get why someone would be threatened by someone wanting to be peaceful with them. A: To understand the dynamics of the ego thought system at work it is essential to look beneath the surface. For this purpose, a phrase used in the training of investigative teams applies aptly to the mind training taught in the Course: \"nothing is as it seems.\" It is insane to think that peace would be a threat in any way, yet that is the ego's interpretation of anything related to the right mind of the Sonship. The ego is insane. The part of the mind that chooses to identify with the ego thought system is threatened by the part of the mind that knows peace. Its foundation is threatened by the possibility that the decision-making part of the mind may make a definitive choice against it in favor of peace, in which case it will cease to exist. When peacefulness is perceived in someone else it is a reminder that the same peace is possible for oneself. All is well if the mind decides to choose peace and identify with the peace it perceives in another. However, if it chooses to identify with the insanity of the ego, it will perceive anything sane as a threat; fear then replaces peace. Guilt for choosing fear instead of peace is projected out in the form of a judgment against someone who seems peaceful. The judgment may come in the guise of envy, admiration, or a desire to bask in the comfort of the peacefulness the other possesses. Strange as it may seem, the ego always interprets this to mean: \"if you have it and I don't, you stole it from me.\" This is the projected version of the mind's",
    "output": "judgment against itself for thinking it stole God's power by deciding to reject the Identity given it by God and make up its own delusional separate identity. This hidden insane thought system is not visible on the surface. It is a disguised attack on oneself and the other person, masquerading as admiration or any number of \"acceptable\" sentiments. The Course teaches that any perception of difference is an attack, and attack engenders fear of counter-attack. Thus begins the ego's endless cycle of perceived threats to be defended against, including someone else's peace. That explains the gnawing, pervasive sense of vulnerability that gives reason to elaborate plans for security. The ego is under constant threat, and therefore in permanent defense mode because it is aware that at any moment the mind that chose for it can abolish it by choosing against it. That is why peace is perceived as a threat. It has nothing to do with the way another person behaves or what they say. It is the mind that chooses the ego that is threatened by the true peace abiding in the right mind, where the memory of God's Love is held. And again, the only reason one would fear God's Love is that the separate self cannot exist in the Oneness of His Love. To follow the path of the Course's teachings, it is enough to be willing to notice how important it is to perceive differences. One of the goals of the Course is to teach us to see all these differences for what they are: weapons of the ego's defense strategy, and not to be deceived by the \"beauty\" of the world's kaleidoscope. Hidden behind the glitz is the fear of peace, and behind that fear is the fear of the Oneness of God's Love that we share. The hope of finding the true peace we seek (not to be confused with the bodily feeling of calm relaxation) begins with realizing we are afraid of it, and have buried the fear beneath layers of denial. This realization opens the door to releasing the fear that blocks the peace. The beginning of healing is to cease denying the sickness. That is why much of the Course is devoted to exposing the ego's use of fear as defense against the peace of God. When we are no longer afraid of it, it will no longer be perceived as a threat: \"When we have overcome fear--not by hiding it, not by minimizing it, and not by denying its full import in any way--this [peace] is what you will really see\" (T-12.II.9:5)."

    "text_input": "Q #1175: I've noticed that night dreams are often mentioned in the general scope of A Course in Miracles. Could you clarify the role that night dreams play in the Course? Are we to pay attention to them as a source of specialness detection? Are they a sign of progress in the study of the Course?  On the other hand, I've hardly seen any testimony of healing reported--not in the wonderful workshops on the net nor in the newsletter nor in the Electronic Outreach. If they are not praised in the Course, why not?",
    "output": "As we begin to identify ourselves increasingly with the mind and not with the body, we will begin to recognize that everything that we seem to be experiencing, whether we think we are a body awake or asleep, is nothing more than the play of symbols in our mind. When we awaken from a night dream, it is not difficult to recognize this. But the Course is asking us to generalize this awareness to all of our experiences. And so, from the perspective of forgiveness, we are asked to acknowledge that all our judgments, whether occurring while we seem to sleep or while we seem to be awake, are wrong and not justified. For there literally is no one out there doing anything to us, and so there is truly nothing to be judged, except the mistaken choice in the mind to identify with the ego thought system. While we remain too fearful to accept the notion that \"ideas leave not their source,\" we can at least recognize the content of our reactions to our experiences, both waking and sleeping, and, when we find ourselves attributing our feelings to anyone or anything that seems to be outside and separate from us, ask ourselves if we are willing to consider the possibility that we are wrong. This at least opens the door to a different Teacher, and thus to a different experience. Our sleeping dreams, once we seem to awaken from them, give us the opportunity to recognize how the mind operates in creating its own reality. It should become easy enough, with a little practice, to recognize the myriad ways, and forms, in which our ego attempts to disguise itself. And the correction for the mistaken choices of our dreams will be nothing more than the recognition that, whatever feelings I may have seemed to experience while I was asleep and dreaming, and no matter how justified they may have seemed within the dream, they could not have possibly been the result of anything outside my own mind, and so they simply represent a decision I have made for how I want to feel, while attempting to attribute those feelings to events that had seemed in the dream to be external to my own mind. And so our sleeping dreams represent another opportunity to recognize the contents of our minds, but beyond that they have no special meaning or significance. There have been a number of other related questions on dreams within this service that you may find helpful, including Questions #41, #160 and #961. As for your wondering about why there are no testimonies to healing through the Course reported anywhere: the only place that healing occurs is in the mind and the only healing that needs to happen is my own, for there is no one else. So what is there to report?! For when my mind is healed, I will know that we all are one--in the dream and in reality."

    "text_input": "Q #1176: You teach that we don't change the world out there through forgiveness; we only change our perception. In my ego experience, however, when I catch the principle behind the problem, the problem is gone, and it doesn't occur anymore to me. If that is what you call change of perception, I'm with you. Nothing needs to be projected once I understand the content behind the \"problem.\" Is it correct to conclude that everything that I bring from darkness into light-- forgiveness--won't \"hide\" anymore in form, and, therefore, the principle/content brought to awareness won't happen again in my illusory world? A: To use an extreme example of what we mean ... if you were living under the control of a repressive, cruel dictator with no way of leaving, you could practice forgiveness by realizing that this dictator cannot take away the peace that is within you, regardless of the harsh external restrictions affecting you physically. You can thus be at peace internally, having no ill feelings toward the dictator, while your external living conditions remain wretchedly inadequate. In this case, your perception would have changed in the sense that you no longer are projecting your guilt from your mind onto anything external, including your own body. You have brought the darkness of judgment and hatred to the light of Jesus' love in your mind, and so you now look on everything through the eyes of that love. All grievances have thus dissolved and only love remains. Your problem is gone, because you have let go of the ego in this instance. Sometimes what happens in a relationship where there are conflicts and grievances is that when one person chooses to shift from the ego's purpose (to keep separation alive) to the Holy Spirit's",
    "output": "purpose (to see shared interests, thus undoing separation), the other person also breaks the special-relationship bargain with the ego, and then the relationship changes for the better. But this is not always the case, and one should have no investment in that happening. As Jesus emphasizes in A Course in Miracles, our only responsibility is to accept the Atonement for ourselves (T-2.V.5:1). When we accept the Atonement (that the separation never happened), there is no more guilt in our minds; and if there is no more guilt, there is no need for the defenses of denial and projection against the pain of that guilt. This is the essence of what Jesus teaches us in Lessons 79 and 80--there is only one problem and it has been solved already (W-pI.79,80). Regardless of what is going on externally, our inner peace would never be disturbed once we let go of our identification with the ego thought system."

    "text_input": "Q #1177: As a result of my study of A Course in Miracles I've encountered an uncomfortable, and at times alarming, lessening of my identification with, and interest in the events and activities of my day-to-day experience. Is this an appropriate result from the shift of thinking that is described as the objective of the Course teachings? How are these feelings of detachment from the dream reconciled with a participation in the curriculum of my life experience so that I may teach and so learn to join as Jesus describes? A: Learning not to take oneself too seriously is indeed one of the rewards of applying the principles of forgiveness to one's life. It is the result of recognizing that everything that occurs is a projection of the mind. Although it is true that the events and activities of day-to-day living are part of the illusion, until the mind is healed of all belief in the separation they are important opportunities in the classroom of forgiveness. The teaching contained in the text and the workbook lessons is meant to be applied to the specific experiences of one's life. All the events and activities do lose the meaning they had before the study of the Course, but can now serve the Holy Spirit's curriculum of healing the mind of the thought of separation: \"The Holy Spirit teaches you to use what the ego has made, to teach the opposite of what the ego has 'learned'\" (T-7.IV.3:3). There could be no higher purpose for the activities that fill our days. Nothing but the ego's devastating curriculum of separation is lost when the mind shifts to the Holy Spirit's lessons. Learning to see everything as a classroom for the practice of forgiveness more than compensates for the loss of interest. One of the goals for a student of the Course is to become a \"happy learner.\" The energy no longer expended in the pursuit of worn-out interests can now be spent paying attention to the activity of the mind that is often very busy putting up \"interesting\" obstacles to the awareness of love's presence (T-in.1:7) in the form of attack thoughts and judgments based on separation. They are the reflection of the mind's fear of fully accepting the memory of God's Love that the Holy Spirit represents. If we are willing to look at these obstacles, without judging, changing, justifying or defending them, they can be given to the Holy Spirit to be healed. As Jesus tells us in the text: \"If you would be a happy learner, you must give everything you have learned to the Holy Spirit, to be unlearned for you\" (T-14.II.6:1). Engaging in this practice of forgiveness is how we join with Jesus and journey with him to the final goal of his Course.",

    "text_input": "Q #1178: What, then, is the nature of thought (and/or Thought) in conjunction with the laws of chaos?",
    "output": "The split mind holds two mutually exclusive thoughts: the ego's thought of separation and the Holy Spirit's thought that separation is impossible. The \"laws of chaos\" (T-23.II) is a term that refers to the insanity that follows when the mind decides to take the ego's thought of separation seriously. They govern all the thinking of the world in complete opposition to reason, which abides only in the truth. There is no reason within the illusion of separation, so there is no real thought: \"While thoughtless ideas preoccupy your mind, the truth is blocked. Recognizing that your mind has been merely blank, rather than believing that it is filled with real ideas, is the first step to opening the way to vision\" (W-pI.8.3:2-3) and the way out of chaos. One of the important teaching goals of the Course is to help us understand that nothing is really happening in the dream of separation because there is nothing outside the unity of God and His one Son. Jesus tells us in many different ways in the Course, that the figure in the dream does nothing. It does not see, or think, or hear: \" ... sights and sounds the body can perceive are meaningless. It cannot see nor hear. It does not know what seeing is; what listening is for. It is as little able to perceive as it can judge or understand or know. Its eyes are blind; its ears are deaf. It can not think, and so it cannot have effects\" (T-28.V.4:4-9). Thus, the brain produces ideas the mind has fabricated to fill the void that results when the mind turns from truth and seeks meaning in illusion. The ideas all support the choice for separation and its companion chaos. The term thinking can be replaced with the term choosing, which is the only activity of the split mind. Thinking, therefore, is synonymous with choosing, and thought with choice. The brain does not think; it reflects the mind's dictates. The split mind does not think; it chooses between the ego and the Holy Spirit. The only real thoughts, therefore, are the thoughts I think with God (W-pI.51.4:4), which, in the mind of the sleeping Son, means choosing the Holy Spirit. In reality, God's only Thought is His Love for the Son, and the Son's only thought is his love for the Father. That is the meaning of workbook Lesson 45: \"God is the Mind with which I think\" (W-pI.45). Everything else is the chaos of the ego's insane thought system, whose foundation is the belief that sin is real, God is a vengeful murderer, and so guilt and fear are justified. In this chaos lies the reversal of reason and of truth. God's laws of love, innocence, and life are replaced with hate, guilt, and death. His Thought is exchanged for thoughtless madness. In choosing separation, the mind chooses the insanity of the laws of chaos, no matter how brilliant the world's \"thinking\" may appear to be. As it chooses against God, it chooses against thought. The laws of chaos, then, are the absence of thought. The Holy Spirit's teaching of forgiveness is the correction to these laws, for it means recognizing that the mind that put them into effect can make a different choice, thereby restoring awareness of its decision-making power to the mind. While the mind remains split between the ego and the Holy Spirit, vigilance for thoughts of judgment and attack is needed, for they reflect the mind's choice for the ego. Learning to identify with the mind in this way establishes mindfulness, and thus undoes belief in the thoughtlessness that gave rise to the laws of chaos. Becoming mindful is the goal of the important mind-training exercises of the workbook. It is the only meaningful use for the thoughts we think we think. They are undone as their emptiness becomes apparent, making way for the laws of God that have never changed: \"Nothing but the laws of God has ever been, and nothing but His Will will ever be\" (T-10.IV.5:5)."

    "text_input": "Q #1179: I read the term God's Son; does that pertain to us as well? Because some of the statements in A Course in Miracles regarding the Son of God are confusing to me.",
    "output": "Your question touches the heart of the separation dilemma--identity confusion. In reality there is only the Oneness of God and His Son; defined in the Glossary as the second Person of the Trinity. This is our true Identity/true Self, always referred to in the Course as God's Son or the Son of God. This Identity remains unchanged by the \"tiny, mad idea\" of separation that crept into the mind of God's Son (T-27.VIII.6:2). Confusion sets in when the mind decides to believe this insane idea is real. Then there seems to be a son/self who is separate from the Father, fragmented into countless individual identities whom we call \"us.\" Fragmentation is thus the essence of separation--each part distinguished from the next. The mind is now split between the identity of separation (the ego), and that of the memory (the Holy Spirit) of its oneness with the Father: \"In a split mind, identity must seem to be divided\" (T-27.II.11:1). In the Course, Jesus speaks to the split mind of the separated Son who no longer knows who he is, having identified with a body and seeming to exist in a world of form. Very early in the text, Jesus puts forth the separation creed, addressing this split mind: \" ... you believe that what God created can be changed by your own mind ... you believe that what is perfect can be rendered imperfect or lacking ... you believe that you can distort the creations of God, including yourself ... you believe that you can create yourself, and that the direction of your own creation is up to you (T-2.I.1:9-12). Here, \"you\" refers to everyone who identifies with the thought of separation (most of us, most of the time). Also found in the Course are many passages in which Jesus speaks of our true Identity: \" ... God's Son is guiltless (T-14.V.2:1); \"God's Son is One\" (T-17.III.7:2); \"God's Son is perfect, or he cannot be God's Son (T-30.VI.9:1); \"You stand in light, strong in the sinlessness in which you were created, and in which you will remain throughout eternity\" (W-pI.94.2:6). In these passages, \"you\" refers to the true Self that is one with God and knows not of separate parts or a split mind. In either case, \"you\" refers to God's Son for there is no one else. It is important to understand this distinction; otherwise identity confusion will be compounded by the belief that Jesus is addressing the body/the figure in the dream. That is never the case. One of the important goals of the Course is to teach the confused separated Son of God that he is not a self, but a Self. \"Your goal is to find out who you are, having denied your Identity by attacking creation and its Creator. Now you are learning how to remember the truth\" (W- pI.62.2:3-4). The process involves learning to distinguish between when Jesus is addressing the self and when he is reminding us of our true Self. It is an important process of gradually dis- identifying with the body in order to identify with the split mind, and eventually with the right mind that reflects the Self. The first step is paying careful attention to the upsets and conflicts, large and small, that present themselves every day. They reflect the mind's choice to deny its identity as a mind/God's Son, and to identify with the body instead. Being willing to make that simple recognition identifies the problem at its source (the mind), where the correction can be found. It reminds the mind that it has the power to choose. This is a very important step in the mind's return to acknowledgment of its Identity as God's Son. In the seeming dream of separation, the power to choose unites the Son with the creative power he shares with the Father. Each step in choosing brings the Son closer to full acceptance of his Identity, and will eventually undo all belief in the alien identity of a separate self. Then the ultimate answer to the identity crisis will ring true: \"You are God's Son\" (W-pI.199.8:1)."

    "text_input": "Q #1180: Outside of the Churches and the Bible, the concept of sin has almost no place. It is an obscure term to many people. I somewhat understand the meaning of sin in A Course in Miracles, but I have difficulty applying it to the undoing of my mind's illusion. I don't see sinners and sins; yet I experience suffering. I can't believe that I killed God, and find the idea completely ridiculous and insane. The idea that I made a world separate from God makes me feel that I have made a very foolish mistake, and I can see that I have lost myself in this illusion of a world. I am grateful to God for the Holy Spirit and the teaching of Jesus to help me and my brothers out of this complicated mess! It isn't the punishment from God that scares me, but the consequences of having chosen to believe in a world without God. By this choice I have created a nightmare that seems to have trapped me like a psychedelic bad trip. Am I involved in denial because I cannot relate to sin? Is sin a true archetypal concept in the background of everyone's mind, even a Tibetan Buddhist? Is blaming ourselves for the separation the same as saying that we are a sinners? A: There are many people in both the East and the West who cannot relate to the idea of sin. But there is another way of describing what A Course in Miracles means by sin that practically everyone can connect with, and that is the idea of selfishness or self-centeredness. It would be hard indeed to find someone who has never been selfish in the sense of being preoccupied with satisfying his own needs at someone else's expense--not really caring about the needs of others as long as one's own are met. We all know what self-interest means, and how many times we evaluate situations and relationships only in terms of their impact on us--the what's-in-it-for-me syndrome, for example--thinking of ourselves first, and ignoring suffering or distress that does not directly affect us. (But the Course is not naive in this; it does suggest that we attend to every situation of need, near or afar.) This kind of thinking pervades all levels of relationships: international, national, business, athletics, families, interpersonal, and so on. It is universal because it is the DNA of the ego, so to speak, the foundation of its thought system. We all as one Son separated from God, the Course teaches, and therefore this attitude informs the thinking of every single person whose mind is not ego-free. Separation from God means separation from oneness, so no matter how we describe the motivation for leaving oneness, it would always have something to do with wanting to be autonomous and special, and an abhorrence for joining or unity that does not support an individualized way of existing. We would want to keep as far away as possible from undifferentiated oneness (Heaven), intensely fearing, as the Course describes it, our disappearance back into the Heart of God (W-pII.14.5:5). Because of this, we all must be in terrible conflict deep within our minds, well concealed from our conscious awareness. We know that we intentionally left our Source and our true Identity to establish an identity more to our liking (an act of supreme selfishness). This means we banished God and His creation from our minds and set up a whole new mode of existing, which then",
    "output": "required that we hide the real origin of our existence, as we would not want to be walking around with the identity of \"banisher-of-love-and-God.\" Layers of deception and defenses then became necessary to protect the deception, and to deal with the self-recrimination over doing something we (the one Son) perceived as an attack. The ensuing sense of having a fraudulent existence also needed to dealt with. These dynamics are all involved in what the Course calls sin, although you need not use that religiously based term. What you seem to be sensing is the self-hatred over what clearly was a bad choice with horrendous consequences. Again, while it is not necessary to see sinners and sin, it would be awfully hard to miss the rampant selfishness and self-centeredness in the world and the negative effects of that. An expectation of retaliation almost always accompanies the experience of guilt, but that would not have to be focused on God--there could just be a general sense that you probably deserve to be punished for what you have done to others, and to yourself. Perhaps this is behind your feeling afraid of \"the consequences of having chosen to live in a world without God.\" If you truly accepted this as simply a mistaken choice, you could just admit your mistake and then make the correct choice, which really is the point Jesus is helping us to arrive at. But since you have not been able to change your mind, something else must be intervening in your mind that prevents you from making the right choice. That is what the Course identifies as the fear of loss, and the fear of having to pay somehow for what we did. We definitely would feel trapped here if those were our only options, which the ego has convinced us is the case. In the section in the text called \"The Fear of Redemption\" (T-13.III), Jesus helps us understand these dynamics and how he can help us undo them."

Again and again I clearly see myself sitting with Jesus as he asks for my trust and extends his hand. I stall. I don't give it. I hem and haw. I truly believe if I would just accept the hand he is offering, my so called difficulties would dissipate. A: Getting in touch with how much we do not believe Jesus, much less trust him, is a major milestone in the journey with the Course. This realization cuts through layers of denial, pretense, spiritual arrogance, and specialness. There are two important factors hidden in your concerns that hold the hope of your release from them: you know Jesus is there, and you know he does not leave in spite of the ego's antics. That makes all the difference. You don't have to trust him. In fact if your trust were complete and you believed everything he says, you wouldn't need him. Jesus has not come because we trust him; he has come because we need him. Moreover, he comes precisely because we do not trust him. If Jesus is the symbol of the right mind, and we are not sure we actually have a right mind, much less the use of it, how could we possibly trust him? Faith in the mind's ability to choose to identify with the memory of God's Love, and return to the Oneness we share with Him is lost when the mind wanders off in pursuit of the ego's fun and games. This is expressed in the fear of crucifixion you describe, that claims: \"if I take Jesus' hand--no more fun and games.\" Then there's the other part of the mind that whispers: \"no Jesus, no peace.\" This is the experience of the split mind doing its dance. The question is to whom does one listen?",
    "output": "You have unveiled one of the sneakiest tricks the ego has come up with for students of the Course: using it as an excuse for not truly accepting its message for oneself. This insight in itself peels away layers of defense. Anything that unmasks the ego's dark secrets, hidden in the vaults of denial, is a step into the light. Those steps cannot be taken by the ego and so they must be taken with the one who leads us, which means there is a part of your mind that has taken his hand. It is as simple as that. The Holy Spirit asks no more: \"[He] asks of you but this; bring to Him every secret you have locked away from Him. Open every door to Him, and bid Him enter the darkness and lighten it away. At your request He enters gladly. He brings the light to darkness if you make the darkness open to Him. But what you hide He cannot look upon ... Bring, therefore, all your dark and secret thoughts to Him, and look upon them with Him. He holds the light, and you the darkness. They cannot coexist when both of You together look on them. His judgment must prevail, and He will give it to you as you join your perception to His\" (T-14.VII.6:1-5,8-11). Jesus knows his students don't trust him or believe his message: \"We understand that you do not believe all this. How could you, when the truth is hidden deep within, under a heavy cloud of insane thoughts, dense and obscuring, yet representing all you see?\" (W-pI.41.5:1-2). That is why the heart of forgiveness is uncovering what the ego would keep hidden: \"It merely looks, and waits, and judges not\" (W-pII.1.4:3). There is nothing you need do to the resistance you have revealed to yourself, except not to judge it. When you are ready to relinquish the ego's pain for the peace Jesus has promised, and in which you do believe, you will."

    "text_input": "Q #1182: In your answer to #107, you say: \"So you are quite correct in concluding that looking with Jesus, and choosing against the ego would automatically give you the same vision as Jesus.\" This is in the context of feeling attacked or shamed--at work, home, whatever. My experience is that I am able to at least step back and realize that the feeling is not coming from outside, that whatever someone said or did is being latched onto for the purposes of the ego, but I rarely feel total freedom from it. The feeling continues, and with it a recurring attempt to step back from it. It's not simply \"over.\" Does this make sense? Is it a process of then letting go more? Is it possible to watch the discomfort but have the discomfort, the swirling in the pit of the stomach, continue? Or do I still want it even though it doesn't feel good? I rarely \"automatically [feel] the same vision as Jesus.\" A: Your experience is quite common. The fact that you do not experience the shift does not mean that you have not made progress. You at least realize that you are not upset for the reason you think (W-pI.5), which means you would be less inclined to justify your anger or shame. That is a major step forward, although you may not experience it that way. And, yes, it is possible to watch the discomfort while you are having it. It sounds strange, but that shows that you are beginning to disidentify from your ego. The part of you that is watching is not the ego (as long as there is no judgment involved). But because the discomfort is still there, part of you must still be attracted to victimization. That's normal. We keep layers of defenses concealed from awareness because of our fear of letting go of the ego all at once. We are too afraid of what we think might happen, given the vows we made to be faithful to the ego and its ambassadors of sin, guilt, and fear (T-21.IV; T-19.IV-D.6).",
    "output": "In A Course in Miracles, Jesus encourages us to be patient in our practice and our expectations as we proceed through the stages of healing. That is why he uses the metaphors of a journey and a ladder, and speaks about his curriculum as a process. In Lesson 284, he outlines four basic stages that we would all typically go through in our practice of what we are learning: \"This is the truth, at first to be but said and then repeated many times; and next to be accepted as but partly true, with many reservations. Then to be considered seriously more and more, and finally accepted as the truth\" (W-pII.284.1:5-6). Trust that your willingness to follow Jesus as your teacher will lead to the outcome he guarantees you will achieve (T-8.V.4)."

    "text_input": "Q #1183: Could you explain to me what the course means when it says, \"Give all to All?\"",
    "output": "To understand this phrase we must include the first part of the statement: \"To Have, Give All to All\" (T-6.V-A). It means that to have all the Holy Spirit offers, we must give all the ego's lies over to Him to be transformed, and must be willing to include everyone in the blessings we receive, or they will not be ours. The Holy Spirit's lessons are reversals of the ego's laws. In this one, we find a correction for the ego's belief in scarcity: \"To the ego, to give anything implies that you will have to do without it. When you associate giving with sacrifice, you give only because you believe that you are somehow getting something better, and can therefore do without the thing you give. 'Giving to get' is an inescapable law of the ego ... \" (T-4.II.6:3-5). In the Course, Jesus contrasts the ego's \"giving to get\" with the Holy Spirit's \"giving and receiving are the same\" (T-26.I.3:6). Jesus is addressing the split mind of the Sonship that contains two thoughts: the memory of the truth of God's Love (right mind), and the illusory belief in separation (wrong mind). Only the content of the right mind can truly be given or received, since only it reflects truth. Everything else is some form the ego's law of \"giving to get,\" or its other favorite--sacrifice. The content of the right mind that can be communicated, given and received, is some form of the extension of love: \"You cannot really give anything but love to anyone or anything, nor can you really receive anything but love from them\" (T- 12.VII.9:4). When love is given, it never diminishes in the giver. As is true for everything of the Holy Spirit, \"It increases in you as you give it to your brother\" (T-5.III.2:7). Willingness to look upon a brother without judgment releases one's self from judgment. By the same token, holding a grievance against one person is enough to keep peace away. As long as one attack thought is cherished and withheld from love, peace is impossible. In order to be free of guilt and have the full experience of the beauty of the right mind, we must let everyone off the hook. Therefore, we may restate the phrase you quote: to have peace/love/innocence/true happiness, give every attack thought to the Holy Spirit, and in so doing, all of these will be received for oneself and given to everyone. \"Be willing, then, to give all you have held outside the truth to Him Who knows the truth, and in Whom all is brought to truth\" (T-17.I.6:1)."

A situation occurred where forgiveness needed to be applied and I was able to do that mentally, but I still feel guarded around the person. Is it necessary to have complete restoration with the person? This person doesn't even desire more than a surface relationship with me.",
    "output": "A Course in Miracles teaches us that forgiveness is only about the content in your mind, not about behavior. It is about withdrawing the projections of your own guilt from the other person, and then letting go of the guilt within yourself. Your guiltlessness then allows you to perceive everyone through the non-judgmental eyes of Jesus or the Holy Spirit. It is possible to be free of judgment (condemnation and anger) toward another person, yet still not trust his ego--egos are not trustworthy. So if you feel \"guarded\" in his presence, it could be because you sense that he is still identified with his ego, and not to be trusted with regard to certain forms of interaction. But your right-minded perception would nonetheless see him as a Son of God, and so you would not feel separate from him. You would realize that his ego is no different from anyone else's, that he also has a right mind like everyone else, and that his ego choices have no effect on his true Identity. In an advanced spiritual state, you would feel no fear and you would perceive the call for love behind all of his ego manifestations. Then all of your responses to this person would flow from that holy perception, reflecting the compassion Jesus has for each one of us."

    "text_input": "Q #1185: A question about level confusion. If I remember correctly, all illness is caused by level confusion. I would think that identification with all things of Level Two would cause illness. Please explain. Perhaps your answer might enlighten me about some subtleties of level confusion. If feeling threatened, I am to use denial properly, i.e. \"nothing in this world can harm me\" and yet not say \"nothing in this world can harm me because I am not a body\" since body denial is improper. True?",
    "output": "When we speak of Level Two, we are not speaking about a level of reality. We are referring to a level of discourse in A Course in Miracles. Sometimes Jesus makes Level One statements: \"Pain is impossible,\" for example (W-pII.284.1:2). Well, since that statement does nothing for most of us --we continue to experience pain as real--Jesus then must talk to us about pain as though it were real, even though he knows it is not. This gets us into the other level of discourse in A Course in Miracles. Thus, Level Two discussions focus on helping us learn about right- minded and wrong-minded ways of interpreting pain, to stay with that example. Level One says that all perception is illusory. Level Two contrasts wrong-minded and right-minded perception. Level confusion regarding sickness refers to the \"levels\" of mind and body, where we tend to think that sickness originates in the body in some way, not with a decision the mind makes. The foundation of this is \"the belief that there is a creative ability in matter which the mind cannot control\" (T-2.IV.2:8). What corrects this distortion is understanding that the body is nothing but a projection of the mind; it is never anything other than an idea in the mind. A sick body is still an idea that has never left the mind; a healthy body is an idea that has never left the mind. It is a confusion of levels to think that physical and psychological symptoms are caused by something other than a choice made by one's mind. Now to the issue of using denial properly. If you are feeling threatened, the first thing you want to do is acknowledge that, and not pretend you are not feeling threatened, by covering over your feelings and trying to convince yourself that you are not a body, when you are feeling very much like a body. Denying what you are feeling will not help you advance spiritually, as Jesus tells us (T-2.IV.3:8-12). It would be more helpful to do something that would calm you down or take you out of the threatening situation. Then you can have a conversation with yourself: \"I know the Course teaches that nothing in this world can harm me, but I feel threatened right now, and so I will ask the Holy Spirit to be my Teacher as I go through this experience. That will help me not judge or blame myself or anyone else, and that is what will bring healing to my mind, regardless of how my body is feeling.\" This is the compromise approach that Jesus encourages us to follow that meets us where we are and gently leads us toward the experience of true invulnerability and innocence (T-2.IV.5). At this level, we practice \"true denial\" by learning that we can be peaceful regardless of the condition of our body. Nothing external can give us the peace of God or take it away from us."

I consider the Course to be my spiritual path with forgiveness being the way out of the dream. However, I also find that practicing yoga, meditation, and chanting are great tools for me to use to focus, increase my awareness, and remember my divinity. I also use yoga as a way to see the body and its energy symbolically, while understanding that it's not real. I also love my yoga community. Are there any conflicts with this? A: Many students continue with other practices such as yoga and meditation while they are learning to integrate the principles of A Course in Miracles into their lives. There is no need to discontinue what you find helpful, whether that is yoga, going to a fitness center, meditating, long-distance running, or eating organic foods. Why stop doing something that helps you feel better and function better? Similarly, there is no need to leave a community you feel comfortable in and love so much just because you are a student of the Course.",
    "output": "Our goal as Course students is to become less judgmental and selfish as we go through our day interacting with others--family, friends, groups, co-workers, team mates, etc. This can be practiced in any milieu--forgiveness can be learned and practiced while doing yoga, shopping, or playing golf. The idea is to shift the purpose of all these kinds of activities from achieving bodily results to learning that everything is a classroom in which either the ego or the Holy Spirit is teaching you, depending on your choice (the content in your mind). With the ego as your teacher, you will continually feel special and separate in some way--with interests you do not share with everyone else. With the Holy Spirit or Jesus as your Teacher, you will experience yourself as less and less separate from others, as you realize your interests are not separate from anyone else's. Form will recede in importance as content ascends and occupies more and more of your attention. The discussion in our answer to #282 might be helpful in shedding further light on this issue."

    "text_input": "Q #1187: This idea of us choosing to project our guilt onto our body really has me, and I just want to check my thoughts with you. Are you saying that A Course in Miracles is saying that if all of a sudden I have an outbreak of acne, for example, which is really upsetting me and which makes me not feel good about the way that I look, that I actually chose this? This happened recently and then I realized afterward that the acne may have happened from my recent chocolate binge. So, assuming that I am right; the theory does not make sense to me, because if I had known the chocolate would cause this, I would not have eaten it. Is the Course saying that we choose on some level to remain ignorant of some worldly cause/effect relationships so that we feel victimized? How can someone choose to feel victimized if they are unaware of the possible consequences of their action or actions and they truly felt they were following a good course? Do we know on some level that we are wrong?",
    "output": "The choices are made by the decision maker in the mind outside time and space, not by the person who appears to be living in the world as a body. Thus Jesus asks, \"Who is the 'you' who are living in this world?\" (T-4.II.11:8). The understanding of this is made a little easier by going back to the ego's plan that we have identified with in our minds. The main piece in its strategy to keep us bound to it is to render us mind-less and then ensure that we never regain awareness of our identity as decision-making minds. This strategy results ultimately in our experience of ourselves as bodies subject to all kinds of laws not of our making: laws of biology, physics, chemistry, nutrition, etc. We thus have become oblivious to the source of all of our perceptions--our mind's decision-making power--and are left believing we come into a world ruled by pre-existing laws. Jesus responds: \"Perhaps you think you did not make the world, but came unwillingly to what was made already, hardly waiting for your thoughts to give it meaning. Yet in truth you found exactly what you looked for when you came\" (W-pI.132.4:4-5). This is one of the Course's more radical teachings, to be sure, but it is necessary to come back to this level in order to understand the nature and purpose of the body, and why we experience things the way we do. It is the key to resolving your problem. The body simply carries out the wishes of the mind; it has no life of its own. This is explained in many places in the Course; for example, \"The mind makes ... all decisions that are responsible for the body's condition\" (M-12.5:7) and \"The Secret Vows\" (T-28.VI). Thus, it is not you as an individual person in the world who chooses to be victimized; it is the mind fulfilling its pledge of fidelity to the ego that so chooses. The mind decides to deny its identity as mind and substitute another identity in its quest to remain separate from God but not be held responsible for that state. It therefore makes up a world with certain laws and then projects itself into the world as a body that is born and eventually dies, in the process deliberately forgetting it (the mind) did this. The body does not age because of the laws of aging; and the face does not break out because of chemical interactions with chocolate (although within the world that is true). The mind is running the whole show in order to achieve its objectives. A vulnerable body reacting favorably or unfavorably to laws external to it is an essential part of the mind's plan. That is what Jesus is helping us to understand. It is the mind that has a need to perceive external victimization to avoid seeing itself as the victimizer of God, and so it makes the whole thing happen. It is all made up! But it is also very convincing, as we can all attest. Jesus points out that \"resistance to recognizing this is enormous, because the existence of the world as you perceive it depends on the body being the decision maker\" (M-5.II.1:7). In \"Sickness is a defense against the truth,\" Jesus explains that these decisions are made in clear awareness, but for the plan to work, the mind has to forget immediately what it did: \" ... your plan requires that you must forget you made it, so it seems to be external to your own intent; a happening beyond your state of mind, an outcome with a real effect on you, instead of one effected by yourself. It is this quick forgetting of the part you play in making your own 'reality' that makes defenses seem to be beyond your own control\" (W-pI.136.4:3; 5:1). Again, Jesus is referring only to the you that is the mind, the decision maker. He is never talking about the bodily you, because he is telling us there is no such critter! \"The idea of separation produced the body and remains connected to it, making it sick because of the mind's identification with it. You think you are protecting the body by hiding this connection, for this concealment seems to keep your identification safe from the 'attack' of truth. If you but understood how much this strange concealment has hurt your mind, and how confused your identification has become because of it!\" (T-19.I.7:7-8; 8:1; see also T-18.VI.9) The confusion of the body/brain with the mind is the root of many of the problems students have with A Course in Miracles. And it is a natural mistake to make, because we have no awareness of ourselves as minds (paradoxically, a choice made by our own minds). That is why we need a teacher like Jesus who is outside the dream. He has provided us with a carefully planned mind- training program that will restore to our awareness what we split off, our true Identity as one with our Creator. We need but humbly admit that we may be wrong about what we think is real, and that his non-judgmental presence in our minds will lovingly guide us on our journey back to the Home we never truly left. For further study of the mind-brain issue, see Questions #117, #391, #825iii, and #901."

One is only required to forgive and our actions, good or bad, are only illusions, which do not exist. But if it follows that the Course instructs nothing regarding behavior, why would forgiveness be an important element as forgiveness is applied towards imagined wrongs or sins or errors committed? Finally, if there is no reality of behavior how can there be forgiveness for what never happened? Ignoring the matter may seem more accurate.",
    "output": "The questions you raise may make sense within the context of your former religious education, but the Course begins from radically different premises and its teachings can only be understood and appreciated when we recognize that it is saying something very different from nearly every other spiritual teaching the world has to offer (e.g., T-18.VII.4-6). While the Course, it is true, is not concerned with behavior, it is very concerned with thought, which is the source of all perceived behavior (T-2.VI.3; T-4.IV.2:1; T-5.V.8:3). It is our thoughts, not our actions, that the Course asserts have consequences (e.g., T-12.III.7; W-pI.54.1-2). So, while the Course may not say that we reap what we sow in terms of behavior, it implores us to recognize that our thoughts produce very definite experiences within our minds (e.g., W-pI.132.1,2), and that there are really only two categories of thoughts--right-minded thoughts and wrong-minded thoughts, each with an outcome diametrically opposed to the other. The Course's focus is on the mind because, from its perspective, the world is nothing more than a dream (T-4.I.4:4-5; T-18.II.5:1-11; T-27.VII.13). Consider that while you sleep at night and dream of vicious attacks and cruelties perpetrated by other figures against you or your loved ones, you may desire vengeance or seek to make others pay for their destructive actions within your dream. But once you awaken, or if you know you are dreaming while you remain asleep, you understand that seeking to hold any of the figures in your dream accountable for their actions makes no sense and is really quite silly--there are no real figures doing evil to others, but only thoughts or symbols within your own mind interacting according to the script your own unconscious mind has written. The problem is not with the symbols in your dream but with the thoughts within your mind that lie behind the symbols you seem to be experiencing. You would readily recognize, if you knew you were dreaming, that the only meaningful choice is between continuing to dream and awakening (T-29.IV.1). To be concerned with what does or doesn't happen with the figures within your sleeping dream is only to continue to indulge in fantasy for your own apparent amusement and entertainment. The Course is inviting us to generalize this recognition to our lives in the world, which the Course refers to as our \"waking dreams\" (T- 18.II.5:12-15). What lies beneath your question is the belief that we must all pay for our sins and it is an unfair universe where people can get away with murder. But if there really is no one other than myself, then to hold on to that belief and desire for earthly justice means I've been hoodwinked by the ego once again into wanting to make attack and grievances real, which keeps the dream of separation real in my mind, and keeps me apart from God's Love. Forgiveness is never for anyone but myself. And it can never be a matter of ignoring my experiences and calling that forgiveness, for my experiences always reflect which teacher I have chosen within my own mind. And when I believe I can simply ignore my own choices, I am secretly choosing the ego, with all the unpleasant consequences that follow from that choice--sin, guilt and fear, and all their various expressions in form. What ultimately needs forgiving is our own decision for separation, and not anyone's behavior within the dream, which we may have judged as bad or wrong or sinful. Yes, the Course says there ultimately is nothing to forgive, because it's all a dream. But while we are too afraid of awakening, then having a non-judgmental attitude toward all that we are perceiving--which is what the Course means by forgiveness--is the only way that we don't reinforce the reality of the dream in our own mind. Jesus describes this process in the manual for teachers: \"God's teachers choose to look on dreams a while. It is a conscious choice. For they have learned that all choices are made consciously, with full awareness of their consequences. The dream says otherwise, but who would put his faith in dreams once they are recognized for what they are? Awareness of dreaming is the real function of God's teachers\" (M-12.6:2-6). Gradually, through that nonjudgmental attitude of forgiveness, we release our investment in our own guilt and sense of sinfulness, which are the hidden motivating forces behind the dream, just as our own unresolved inner conflicts and guilt are the source of our sleeping nightmares. And as we release the guilt, the fear of awakening gradually subsides, until that instant when we realize nothing matters except God's Love, which is our and all our seemingly separate brothers' true reality. For a related question that addresses your concern over whether we should reap what we sow, see #363, which considers the issue in the context of the principle of karma in relationship to the Course's teachings. You may also find Questions #514i, #577 and #738--all on karma--of some interest as well."

It is hard to imagine a life without pleasure, goals, accomplishments. What are we going to be doing? And with what, since we won't have a body? Will we have an incorruptible body? And if we won't have a body, will we be able to still touch, feel, laugh, play, etc.?",
    "output": "There is no need to worry. When the mind of the Sonship is completely healed and returns to full acceptance of its oneness with God, it will have no other awareness but that of the Father's Love. This is the state of pure spirit and the only reality. It is unnecessary and impossible to understand or describe this state from the perspective of the unhealed split mind. When the mind chooses to believe that separation from God is possible, it also identifies with the body and completely forgets that it is a mind with the power to choose. That explains why it seems so alien, and even undesirable, to consider any kind of experience that does not involve the physical, psychological, or emotional body in some way: \"You cannot even think of God without a body, or in some form you think you recognize\" (T-18.VIII.1:7). Meanwhile, the more immediate goal of A Course in Miracles is to learn to identify with the mind that has been forgotten, through the process of forgiveness. Because resistance is strong and the mind's attachment to the body-identity is intense, the process is gentle and gradual. It requires only willingness to begin to recognize that the experiences of one's life are projections of the mind's choice to believe the ego's lie of separation or the Holy Spirit's memory of God's Love. The foundation of the ego thought system is the belief that something external to the mind can have an effect on it. Everything is then perceived and judged from this viewpoint, and used to prove that the world is real and separation is a fact. The Holy Spirit, on the other hand, has come to teach us that nothing external to the mind has any effect on it because there is nothing outside the mind. To learn this \"requires willingness to question every value that you hold\" (T- 24.in.2:1). \"Every value\" refers to all the things associated with the body that reflect the ego thought system: pleasure, accomplishments, feelings, playing, etc. These things are all substitutes for the peace of God that was abandoned when the mind chose the ego. They are cover-ups for the intense pain that follows the choice for separation. The mind has become so confused about its identity it no longer is able to distinguish between pleasure and pain, nor is it aware of what it truly wants: \"Therefore ask not of yourself what you need, for you do not know, and your advice to yourself will hurt you. For what you think you need (everything you think is pleasurable and meaningful) will merely serve to tighten up your world against the light, and render you unwilling to question the value that this world can really hold for you\" (T-13.VII.11:5-6). The only value the world has is as a classroom to learn the lessons of the Holy Spirit embodied in forgiveness. Until the mind is fully healed, and every pleasure, goal, or accomplishment of the world is of no interest, forgiveness is our only concern. The unhealed mind is much better occupied with the process of healing than with the perfect Oneness that lies far beyond its ability to comprehend. Fear of the perfect Love the Father shares with His Son prevents the experience of it, and makes it seem not only unappealing, as you have pointed out, but terrifying. And so a \"gentler dream,\" accomplished through forgiveness, precedes full awakening: \"[God's Son] could not waken to reality without the sweat of terror and a scream of mortal fear, unless a gentler dream preceded his awaking, and allowed his calmer mind to welcome, not to fear, the Voice that calls with love to waken him; a gentler dream, in which his suffering was healed and where his brother was his friend. God willed he waken gently and with joy, and gave him means to waken without fear\" (T-27.VII.13:4-5). Let us use the means (forgiveness) we have been given, that we may learn that love is not an alien state, but our home."

If the Holy Spirit is an illusion, then the \"giver\" must be an illusion, too. Could you please clarify this for me? A: These are logical questions, and have been asked by many students. First, the Holy Spirit is spoken of both as illusory (in the form of the Voice for God), and as part of the \"eternal formlessness of God\" (C-6.5:8). As the \"Answer,\" the Holy Spirit is illusory as you say; but He is also part of God, and in that sense is eternal with God.",
    "output": "The idea that God gave an answer to the separation the instant the Son took that idea seriously needs to be understood as a part of the myth presented in the Course to give us some help in understanding how we got to be in the situation in which we find ourselves. The apparent inconsistency can be remedied by recognizing that some parts of the Course are meant to be taken literally and others are meant to be taken metaphorically. Thus, the parts of the Course that talk about God's connection with the separation are never meant literally. Jesus must use language and examples that we can relate to and process, otherwise he could never help us. Oneness is the only truth and the only reality. But what does that mean to us? It is meaningless, and therefore he must use the language of duality to get through to us, even though he knows duality is illusory. (See T-25.I.5-7.) For further discussion, we refer you to #616 in which we briefly summarize this approach and then mention several other questions and answers that you can read that deal with various aspects of your questions that have been raised by other students. A comprehensive discussion of the language of the Course can be found in Chapter 2 of Few Choose to Listen, Vol. 2 of The Message of A Course in Miracles."

I am convinced that the world will not become a better place, and so, not in resignation, but happily, I turn to the only place to go in seriousness, which is inside, and do the work there. I am asking about this because I remember thinking that the world will change some day because of our inner work, and then we will see happy headlines instead of catastrophic headlines.",
    "output": "It seems as if you are reflecting the important principle of A Course in Miracles: \"Seek not to change the world, but choose to change your mind about the world\" (T-21.in.1:7). It is essential to understand this passage as pertaining only to content, not form. The opening statement of the paragraph in which this quote appears provides its context: \"Projection makes perception\" (T- 21.in.1:1). This is the thrust of Jesus' teaching and his training of us. He wants us to learn how to perceive correctly, which means learning to make a connection between our perception and the prior choice we made in our minds to identify with the ego's thought system or the Holy Spirit's thought system. Our interpretation of what our eyes see follows directly from that choice. If we identify with the thought system of forgiveness, we can look on scenes of overwhelming devastation and know that devastation has nothing to do with reality (W-pII.13.1:3). We will not be indifferent to the suffering of others; we will be at peace as we deal with the situations in our lives and the world because we will know that pain and suffering do not define our reality. We will be in the world but not of it. The origin of the world is a thought of attack (W-pII.3.2:1), and therefore it is not surprising that headlines constantly scream of disaster and catastrophe. That will continue until the mind of God's Son no longer is attracted to separation. When we are unwilling to pay the high price of being separate, we will ask for help to change our minds about our purpose for being here, and then the world will take on a different purpose: \"It becomes a home in which forgiveness is born, and where it grows and becomes stronger and more all-embracing. Here is it nourished, for here it is needed\" (M-14.2:2-3). When every seemingly separate mind has at last accepted the Atonement, the world will not become a better place with \"happy headlines\": \"It will merely cease to seem to be\" (M-14.2:12). There will be no need for a world when there no longer is any guilt in our minds that needs to be projected. But we needn't fear that the world will disappear before we are ready to leave it behind: \"Fear not that you will be abruptly lifted up and hurled into reality. Time is kind, and if you use it on behalf of reality, it will keep gentle pace with you in your transition. The urgency is only in dislodging your mind from its fixed position here\" (T- 16.VI.8:1-3). In the section \"I Need Do Nothing,\" Jesus teaches us how to walk his unique path of forgiveness, a path that has us quietly peaceful in our minds while busily active in the world. It is not a path of indifference or escapism. One way of describing this approach is to say that we learn to become passive to the ego but not to the Holy Spirit. Our peace is sustained by our choice to identify with the Holy Spirit's thought system, because then whatever we do will be done through us, with no effort or strain on our part. That is the essence of Jesus' message in this section: \"To do nothing is to rest, and make a place within you where the activity of the body ceases to demand attention ... This quiet center, in which you do nothing, will remain with you, giving you rest in the midst of every busy doing on which you are sent. For from this center will you be directed how to use the body sinlessly. It is this center, from which the body is absent, that will keep it so in your awareness of it\" (T-18.VII.7:7; 8:3-5)."

    "text_input": "Q #1192: What is beyond the physical? Someone defined insanity as doing the same thing again and again and expecting different results. I believe the way the majority of us live is possibly a better definition of insanity: we hunt for food, we eat, sleep, and reproduce. The approaches we have developed to maintain this cycle differ, but with some variation, produce the same results regardless of one's status in society. Can this cycle be a valid reason for our existence? A: To be technically accurate, we would have to say there is nothing beyond the physical because the physical does not exist. To say that there is something beyond it is to say it is real somehow. However, to start with our experience of the physical as real, we can then say that one of the principal purposes of A Course in Miracles is to help us realize that that experience is a defense against the truth. The truth is that only spirit in a state of perfect Oneness is real. Jesus thus is teaching us how we came to believe that the physical world and body are real and how to undo that erroneous belief. \"It cannot be too strongly emphasized that this course aims at a",
    "output": "complete reversal of thought\" (M-24.4:1). Through our study of the text and our practice of the workbook exercises we will gradually make the shifts in our thinking that will lead us beyond the body (T-18.VI) and beyond all the idols (T-30.III) we made as substitutes for our true Identity as spirit, one with God's Love. Insanity, from the Course's perspective, is thinking that we really exist apart from God as separate individuals. God is totality. There cannot be anything outside totality, and to think there can be is insanity, for we would then wind up seeing what is not there! Jesus thus instructs us: \"There is one life. That life you share with Him. Nothing can be apart from Him and live\" (W- pI.156.2:7-9); \"Life not in Heaven is impossible, and what is not in Heaven is not anywhere\" (T- 23.II.19:6). Our work as students of this course, thus, is to ask our inner Teacher to help us learn how to use the world and the body to undo our belief that we are separate from God, our Source. We thus will be able to live more peacefully, with less guilt, anger, and judgment."

    "text_input": "Q #1193: When I feel fearful, I don't ask Jesus for his help. He makes it clear that I have chosen to make myself fearful, and that I should not ask him for release from the fear, but for help with the conditions that made me fearful --the wish to be separate (T-2.VI.4). Sometimes I do remember to do that, but at other times all I can remember is the four letter prayer, \"Help!\" Yet, I do want to have him remove all fear and hatred, and to be forgiven. What am I missing here?",
    "output": "The only way we can be totally and forever free from fear is by allowing ourselves to get back in touch with the power of our minds to choose. Then we will realize that we have been deceiving ourselves about ourselves, and have been looking on illusions the whole time we thought we were seeing reality (W-pII.240). We are choosing to make illusions true, and then concealing that choice from ourselves. Since that is the root of all fear, what good would it do for Jesus to take away our fear when we are holding onto its cause? It is not that he is refusing to do it, but that he cannot take our fear away because we are holding onto what is producing it. In A Course in Miracles, Jesus is also teaching us to take responsibility for our thoughts, for as he says, \"You may believe that you are responsible for what you do, but not for what you think. The truth is that you are responsible for what you think, because it is only at this level that you can exercise choice. What you do comes from what you think\" (T-2.VI.2:5-7). Fear comes from our choosing the thought system of separation, and that is where Jesus' help is directed--toward helping us get in touch with the power of our minds so we can change our decision and then be at peace. That is why he says in the next section: \"You may still complain about fear, but you nevertheless persist in making yourself fearful. I have already indicated that you cannot ask me to release you from fear. I know it does not exist, but you do not. If I intervened between your thoughts and their results, I would be tampering with a basic law of cause and effect, the most fundamental law there is. I would hardly help you if I depreciated the power of your own thinking. This would be in direct opposition to the purpose of this course\" (T-2.VII.1:1-6). This is very difficult for us to accept and work with because we don't want to accept responsibility for our plight. But that is the only way to sure and lasting peace. Although Jesus does not remove fear from our minds, he promises to go with us into the recesses of our minds that we have kept concealed in darkness: \"Fear lives in darkness, and when you are afraid you have stepped back. Let us then join quickly in an instant of light, and it will be enough to remind you that your goal is light\" (T-18.III.2:4-5; see also T-11.V.1:3-4). We simply need to remember that his comforting presence is there with us at every instant: \"If you knew Who walks beside you on the way that you have chosen, fear would be impossible\" (T-18.III.3:2). Thus, looking with Jesus at our attraction to separation is the release from fear; and we practice this each time we choose not to see our interests as separate from anyone else's."

    "output": "The purpose you identify with in your mind is the key to applying the principles of A Course in Miracles. \"What is it for?\" is the only question Jesus wants us to ask about anything (T- 4.V.6:8-11; T-24.VII.6:1-3). That simplifies things enormously, because there are only two purposes we can choose: the purpose of the ego (to see ourselves as bodies, separate from others), or the purpose of the Holy Spirit (to see ourselves as sharing the same interests with others). Applying this to performing Reiki means that you would see each session as a means of learning that you and this other person share the same split mind and the power to choose either the ego or the Holy Spirit as your teacher. Thus, the form pertains to the body; but the content pertains to the thought system you choose to identify with. We have been asked this type of question in relation to other kinds of practices; you might find it helpful to read our answer to #1186."

    "text_input": "Q #1195: If one makes an unintentional mistake that causes sorrow in others, how should one look at this situation? What is the lesson to be learned?",
    "output": "If it is appropriate, the first order of business is to apologize in a normal fashion. Then the truly important business is to look at the thoughts that arise as a result of the mistake. There may be self-recrimination, arrogance in believing that one is responsible for the happiness or distress of others, guilt, shame, self-defense (\"I didn't mean to do it\"), and on and on. All are forms of upset that serve the ego well in its scheme to keep the mind focused on externals, swirling in tides of guilt. Having these thoughts in support of the ego's strategy is the real mistake. The real correction begins with willingness to see the erroneous beliefs that are hidden in a seemingly \"innocent\" mistake. It means being willing to recognize that if you are upset by any situation it is because you want to be upset. If after an apology you notice that the upsetting feelings persist, you have a clear indication that the mind is choosing to be upset. This can only mean it is making a purposeful choice to make the separation real, and to engender guilt to keep itself in conflict rather than to accept the Holy Spirit's peace. That is the important lesson to be learned. The situation thus becomes a lesson in forgiveness, wherein the Holy Spirit reminds the mind that nothing outside itself is the source of its upset, which is likewise true for the sorrow experienced by the others. This is a very important lesson that is more difficult to learn than it seems; for the existence of the physical universe depends on the belief that the mind can go outside itself and be affected by externals. A Course in Miracles calls magic the belief that something outside the mind can have an effect on it. The miracle teaches us to return to the mind the power of causation: \"The miracle is the first step in giving back to cause [the mind] the function of causation, not effect\" (T-28.II.9:3). This principle of cause and effect is fundamental to the thought system of the Course. It is important to keep it in mind when practicing forgiveness in any specific situation. The key is to remember that whatever circumstances seem to be the cause of any form of upset, a choice in the mind is the real cause. Workbook Lesson 5 puts this forth in unmistakable terms: \"I am never upset for the reason I think\" (W-pI.5). It is sufficient to be willing to remind oneself that this is true, no matter how real and convincing the external \"cause\" may seem to be. The reminder strengthens the mind's belief in its power to choose, and diminishes its belief in the power of externals. More is learned in this simple application than is immediately apparent. In fact, it holds the only purpose for the world--to serve as a classroom for forgiveness. Thus, the lesson to be learned in every situation is the same: \"It is impossible the Son of God be merely driven by events outside of him. It is impossible that happenings that come to him were not his choice. His power of decision is the determiner of every situation in which he seems to find himself by chance or accident\" (T-21.II.3:1-3). This is true whatever appear to be the circumstances, feelings, or cause of an event. All we are asked to do is remember this, and know that in so doing the Holy Spirit is invited to correct the mistaken beliefs at the root of every conflict."

    "text_input": "Q #1196: We read that sickness is an attempt by the ego to make the body real. However this can be considered and contemplated by an adult mind, what purpose would illness serve in a baby who could not consider the implications of sickness as a learning device?",
    "output": "Although this is extremely hard for us to grasp, a baby has the same mind and the same power to choose the ego or the Holy Spirit that an adult has; its brain, of course, differs from that of an adult. But it is only the mind that makes decisions, as we discuss in Questions #117, #391, #825iii, and #901. It is not the baby that chooses sickness. The form of the body is irrelevant, not in this illusory world, obviously, but rather in terms of our spiritual journey. The differences in form are part of the ego's clever strategy to keep us away from our minds, lest we realize we chose against love and peace so that we could exist as separate individuals: \"Nothing so blinding as perception of form. For sight of form means understanding has been obscured\" (T-22.III.6:7- 8). If we realized that all of our misery is rooted in that one decision, not in the world or the body, we would rather quickly question the wisdom of that choice--especially since we would know that we chose against the other option open to us. The ego thus is ferociously intent on keeping us mind-less, which it does by having us dwell only on the body and all of the problems that arise from bodily existence. A mind choosing to project itself as a helpless, deficient, or sick infant is all part of this plan. Through A Course in Miracles, Jesus is helping us unlearn what the ego taught us so that we will recover a sense of ourselves as minds all sharing the same purpose of recognizing our mistake, choosing again, and returning Home. Our perception of innocent, vulnerable babies and children thus can serve either the ego's purpose or the Holy Spirit's purpose. We can see them as proof that differences, separation, and victimization is real, or as part of our classroom in which we are learning that we all share the same interests and the same identity. It is important to remember that this is only about the content in our minds, not behavior. Thus, you would still act appropriately and do what you usually do with babies, but you would do so with a growing awareness of the content in your mind."

    "text_input": "Q #1197: In the teachings of the Foundation, based on A Course in Miracles, I have often heard it said that I am not responsible for the acts of others but that I am responsible for my interpretations of their acts. On an experiential level this certainly seems to be the proper way to take responsibility and to ask for help to change my mind about what others do rather than trying to change them. However, as I more and more begin to question \"who is the [I] who [am] living in this world?\" (T-4.II.11.8), is it not helpful to remind myself that I am responsible for having fragmented my Self into the self that is experienced as myself and into the others and then pitting these fragments against each other in order to maintain the belief in separation, guilt, sin, etc. (T- 28.VI.4.7), and thus that I am responsible not only for my interpretations but also for the acts of others? And is not this very reminder (that we are all one) one form of correcting the belief in separation and separate interests? A: Yes, both levels of correction are a part of the process of undoing the ego thought system we have accepted as a replacement for the truth. Using the metaphor of a ladder, the second step is well beyond the first one you describe, of recognizing that we always interpret what others do, and more often than not, that interpretation comes straight from our ego--and that that is the problem, not what others do or do not do. Our self-concept gradually begins to change as we practice this and become more comfortable thinking this way. It must change, for our \"normal\" self-concept is almost totally defined by the perception that \"I am the thing you made of me ... \" (T-31.V.5:3). Therefore, when we begin to realize we have built our self-concept on what turns out to be an insidious plot to give ourselves innocence at God's and everyone else's expense, and then decide to ask for help to undo this deception, our sense of who we are undergoes a transition. This happens without our actually focusing on changing anything other than our interpretations. This is what takes us to the next step--not a linear process, of course--of beginning to get in touch with ourselves as minds that are always deciding to split off from oneness and remain in a state of separation and individuality, blaming others for that condition, or to undo the progression of splits and accept our true Identity as one with God, our Source. So, yes, at some point we would realize that our decision to be separate required that we split off into a multitude of figures that would victimize each other and be victimized by forces and circumstances in the world itself (T-18.I.4-5). On a very deep level that is where our guilt is overwhelming--that we want there to be catastrophes, disasters, and brutality so that our plan to remain separate but not be responsible for it would work. It is essential to remember that the self that is responsible for this is not the self we think we are and that interacts in the world--it is the mind outside time and space that makes these decisions. But we should not force ourselves to try to experience that larger self, as we all have tremendous fear of letting go of the self we are familiar with. Jesus thus talks about his plan to help us awaken gently and without fear (T-27.VII.13), and so our focus should be on developing trust in Jesus and his guidance (T-4.VI.3:1; 6:1). His loving presence within us is always there to look with us at the hideous plot we support in our minds so that we will take the next step with him of",
    "output": "realizing it is all just an expression of a \"tiny, mad idea, at which the Son of God remembered not to laugh\" (T-27.VIII.6:2). That is why he tells us that when we think about \"the mad projection by which this world was made\" that we \"call it not sin ... invest it not with guilt ... and above all, be not afraid of it\" (T-18.I.6:6-9)."

    "text_input": "Q #1198: I just want to know where we go, after we die. I know its not a \"place.\" Do we go to the Beatific Vision, or do we go to such complete absorption into oneness that we have no \"awareness\" of our self, or awareness of any \"self,\" so that the Buddhist term of the Void is more appropriate? If there is a God, but I do not \"know\" Him in some way after death, then its almost like there is no God, at least to this little speck called \"me.\" Does the God I've prayed to disappear with me at the time of my physical dissolution, or does the part of me that knows and prays continue in some form?",
    "output": "All the parts of the puzzle regarding death are answered in A Course in Miracles' most important teaching--the Son of God is a mind, not a body. In choosing to identify with the illusion of separation, the mind gives birth to the idea of a self, a world, and a God who relates to them. All of these notions are made up in support of the separation thought. Without this thought, neither life as we know it, nor death, have any meaning. It is this thought that persists beyond the \"life\" of the body until the mind fully accepts the Holy Spirit's correction, by which belief in separation is undone. The mind then awakens from the dream of separation to awareness of the oneness with God that never changed. This is accomplished not by death, but through forgiveness of every shadow of belief in the ego thought system. Nothing happens when the body dies (see Questions #68, #175, #187, and #260). In fact, we learn in the Course that there is no death (T-27.VII.14) because \"There is no life outside of Heaven. Where God created life, there life must be. In any state apart from Heaven life is illusion. At best it seems like life; at worst, like death. Yet both are judgments on what is not life, equal in their inaccuracy and lack of meaning\" (T-23.II.19:1-5). Thus, we do not go anywhere when the body dies. When the mind accepts the truth of its Identity as God's Son, it returns to the awareness of what never changed. Removing the obstacles to this awareness is the healing goal of the Course and our only concern. The mind cannot see or understand what it fears. While fear remains, what lies beyond the body and the world is incomprehensible. As we read in the Introduction to the Course, love cannot be taught (T-in.1:6); neither can it be understood. It is possible, and indeed essential to our awakening that we see and understand the mind's intentional choice against love and its devastating effects in our experience. That is why in the Course Jesus repeatedly encourages us to look at the ego thought system at work in our lives and see its painful consequences. Forgiveness is the miracle that shifts the focus from externals (form) to the mind (content). Only by so doing can the mind remember its identity as mind, gradually dissociating from its identity with the body. The question of the body's seeming life and death evaporates as the mind returns to awareness of itself as the Son who never left the Father."

    "text_input": "Q #1199: I have heard Ken say at least a few times that A Course in Miracles is \"not for spiritual giants\" and that it is for people at the \"bottom rung of the ladder.\" It is probably just my identification with the ego that causes me to be bothered by this, but consciously I feel it is because I want to be using the most effective/fastest path to get me home. Ken's teachings on the Course have helped me a lot in being sure I am interpreting the Course clearly, but I really thought the Course was the best means. Is it not? Can you comment more on those comments by  Ken? If the Course is for people on the bottom rung of the ladder, is it fair to say that most of us are not even on the ladder at all?",
    "output": "It is a humbling thought indeed. But, considering the amount of material devoted to helping us with our guilt, hatred, judgment, and specialness, and above all, with remembering that we have a mind, it is not hard to accept that Jesus is not addressing \"spiritual giants.\" Moreover, he refers to us babies, infants, and children--in the spiritual sense, of course. Surely, though, if we learn the lessons he is teaching us, we will wind up at the top of the ladder, and perhaps get there \"faster\" than if we had used other means, but his message and teaching is not directed at those already at the top--the advanced teachers of God, and certainly not the Teachers of teachers who are no longer on the ladder at all (M-26.2). Staying with the metaphor of the ladder, we can say that everyone has at least one foot on the first rung, however precarious the grip might be, because everyone has a right mind, and as Jesus assures us, we are not totally insane (T-16.VI.8:8). Everyone, in some way, has thoughts of kindness and selflessness, although they may be infrequent and fleeting. There are countless people who are deeply grateful for the Course, because they feel that they have finally found the path they have long been searching for. But most of us are contending with tremendous resistance coming from our fear of what we sense Jesus is saying and where this course is leading us. We like to think of ourselves as spiritual, and that is not wrong or dishonest. Yet we have a very hard time just shifting the purpose of our relationships and our involvement in the world, let alone accepting our identity as pure spirit. We even wonder sometimes whether Jesus got it right! What do you mean there is no world! How can you say that sickness is of the mind, not the body--and worst of all, that the body neither lives nor dies! Are you really serious when you say anger is never justified, and that we are never justified in perceiving ourselves unfairly treated? We struggle with all this; so it is no wonder that he tells us in different ways that we are not yet ready to accept his higher teachings about timelessness, spirit, and oneness, and therefore, that we should concentrate on what we can relate to: our seeming bodily life in the world. Some examples: \"To you the miracle cannot seem natural, because what you have done to hurt your mind has made it so unnatural that it does not remember what is natural to it. And when you are told what is natural, you cannot understand it\" (T-16.II.3:1-2). \"One brother is all brothers. Every mind contains all minds, for every mind is one. Such is the truth. Yet do these thoughts make clear the meaning of creation? Do these words bring perfect clarity with them to you? What can they seem to be but empty sounds; pretty, perhaps, correct in sentiment, yet fundamentally not understood nor understandable. The mind that taught itself to think specifically can no longer grasp abstraction in the sense that it is all-encompassing. We need to see a little, that we learn a lot\" (W-pI.161.4). \"When revelation of your oneness comes, it will be known and fully understood. Now we have work to do, for those in time can speak of things beyond, and listen to words which explain what is to come is past already. Yet what meaning can the words convey to those who count the hours still, and rise and work and go to sleep by them?\" (W-pI.169.10:2-4) \"O my child! If you knew what God wills for you, your joy would be complete! ... I cannot tell you what this will be like, for your heart is not ready\" (T-11.3:1,6). We should not be discouraged by this, and we should not spend time pondering where we are on the ladder, because the metaphors of the ladder and the journey give us the impression that the healing process is linear, and it is not. Jesus speaks of the holy instant as \"a miniature of eternity\" (T-17.IV.11:4), which is a way of saying that the experience of the holy instant is the experience of being beyond our ego. Since we have not generalized our lessons of forgiveness, we will leave the holy instant and become body centered again, and then go back and forth until there no longer is any attraction to the ego thought system at all. The happy dream, the real world is our destination, when our minds will be at peace--no conflict, no fear, no guilt. We are then advanced teachers of God, as Jesus describes in the manual (M-4)."

    "text_input": "Q #1200: I just want to ask a follow-up question to #825 to make sure that I understand the effects of choosing specialness. From the way that I understand it, any problem we have in our life can ultimately be traced back to our desire to be special and distinct from our brothers and sisters. Could that mean we have a problem in our life that is rooted back to our desire for specialness in another aspect of our lives? Let us say that I have a desire to be more intelligent than everyone and choose specialness and act on this desire to be more intelligent. Are you saying that this choice will have the painful effects of illusions, but that these may show up in another aspect of my life that has nothing to do with wanting to be more intelligent than others? A: The painful effects of choosing an illusion of yourself as a substitute for the truth about yourself will show up in many different ways, not just in the context of your efforts to be more intelligent than others--that is just the specific form of the underlying content. Another way of saying that we are choosing an illusory identity is to say we are living a lie. Terrible consequences flow from that, obviously. All the unconscious defenses that must be maintained to protect the lie require enormous effort--our defense system must always be on \"high alert\" for anything that could expose the lie and destroy our special position. These dynamics cannot but have a profound effect on all our relationships. The ultimate cause, though, is our choice to reject the Holy Spirit's response to the \"tiny, mad idea\" of separation and accept the ego's instead. This is the level on which the \"repair work\" must take place. The underlying wish is to be superior to God--that is where the real anguish and pain are. It is a laughable thought, really, but that is the thought reflected in the desire to be more intelligent than others. We all act that out every time we value specialness. In A Course in Miracles, Jesus asks us: \"If you perceived the special relationship as a triumph over God, would you want it?\" (T-16.V.10:1). The more we make this connection, the more we will realize that we are hurting ourselves in every attempt to be special, for not only will we be caught in the futility of the ego's \"seek and do not find\" trap (T-12.IV.1:4), but we will be robbing ourselves of the peace and joy that are our eternal inheritance and our \"sacred right\" (T-30.V.9:10).",

    "output": "God in A Course in Miracles is the \"Father\" of Christ His Son. \"Father\" is in quotes because the distinction is made for our benefit, for we cannot understand non-duality, or pure undifferentiated Oneness: \" ... while you think that part of you is separate, the concept of a Oneness joined as One is meaningless\" (T-25.I.7:1); \"Nowhere does the Father end, the Son begin as something separate from Him\" (W-pI.132.12:4).

There are no lips to speak them, and no part of mind sufficiently distinct to feel that it is now aware of something not itself. It has united with its Source. And like its Source Itself, it merely is\" (W-pI.169.5:4-7). The theology of A Course in Miracles, while using the language of the Judaeo-Christian tradition, is decidedly and irreconcilably different from that tradition and most other systems as well, as is evident from this sampling of the Course's teachings about God: (1) The finite universe is not God's creation (T-11.I.4; M-22.5:5); (2) He knows nothing of this world (T- 4.II.8:6-7; T-25.VII.3:3-4); (3) God does not condemn (W-pI.46.1; W-pII.10); (4) He does not demand sacrifice: \"Sacrifice is a notion totally unknown to God\" (T-3.I.4:1). The Course also makes it clear that many of the New Testament accounts of Jesus' life and message are inaccurate or distorted. In fact, the entire Course can be read and studied from that point of view. Thus, for example, he speaks of: Atonement without sacrifice, the real message of the crucifixion, and the meaning of resurrection (T-3.I; T-6.I; M-28); the meaning of Christmas (T-15.X,XI), forgiveness and the miracle (W-pII.1,13), and many, many more. Kenneth's book A Course in Miracles and Christianity: A Dialogue covers the main points of difference. Other Questions address the differences as well.

    "text_input": "Q #1202: Is hearing ideas that are wrong harmful?",
    "output": "It is not clear to us what you mean by \"wrong.\" Most of us, most of the time, are listening to the ego, and anything the ego advocates will be \"harmful\" only in the sense that it will reinforce the pain of our separation from God and our true Self. All we need to do is become aware of that and look without judgment at these ideas. To be afraid of them or to fight against them is to make them real and give them a power they do not have. By looking at them without judgment, you are strengthening your identification with your right mind, and then, gradually, you will be less and less influenced by them. In general, it is always best to be guided by the rule of kindness: kindness to yourself and others, which means if you have thoughts that would hurt you or others if acted on, it is best not to act on them."

I must admit, up until now, all of the lessons resonated wonderfully with me and my spirit received them well. However, I am having a very hard time with this, and I feel as if I am positioning myself to accept chaos in my life. It appears to me that God's law would not concern itself with me going to work, or even getting there on time, or whether I dressed appropriately or not, and on and on.",
    "output": "Yes, you are correct in your understanding of God's law. Most students find it very unsettling (to put it mildly) to discover this aspect of A Course in Miracles' teachings. But it is only the ego in you that feels the outcome would be chaos, because the sane part of your mind knows that you are taking a major step in the direction of restoring lasting peace to your mind. It is essential for the ego's survival to keep you thinking that God and you are separate, that your life takes place in this world, and that you must sacrifice, pray, and do good things to get into Heaven after you die. That is the ego's thought system, which Jesus teaches us is simply an insane substitute for the truth, which is that separation from God is impossible and that we are forever one with Him. The fact that God does not know about us and our seeming individual lives does not mean that we have been abandoned and are completely on our own without any comfort or guidance. The purpose of our work with the Course is to develop a relationship with Jesus who is always lovingly present in our minds so that we could allow him then to help us identify and then remove the barriers we have placed between ourselves and love's presence (T-16.IV.6:1). That is the only kind of help that is truly of value, and the only kind we should ever want. Making our lives better in this world is a futile endeavor, for nothing but God's eternal peace and Love could ever satisfy us, and our continuing to believe that we really exist as individuals apart from God is what keeps us from experiencing the peace and Love in which we were created. Questions #131, #157, and #643 all discuss this important issue."

    "text_input": "Q #1204: Even though I studied Lessons 28-29 some years ago, I realize I'm still confused about illusions and the universe. If nothing I see means anything, and this is all an illusion (which I am embracing with time), how can a table, or anything else I see with my eyes, share a purpose with the universe, which is also an illusion. And, how can any of this be shared with the purpose of God? Learning how to look on all things with love, appreciation and open-mindedness seems to make the illusion, and all things in it, a reality instead of a dream. Please explain the holy purpose talked about in the lesson. \"Above all else I want to see things differently.\" A: The first 50 lessons of the workbook build on one another, contrasting the fundamental principles of the ego thought system with those of the Holy Spirit. All the metaphysical principles of the Course are contained in these lessons. They are the foundation for achieving the workbook's goal of \"[training our minds] in a systematic way to a different perception of everyone and everything in the world\" (W-in.4:1). It is helpful to keep this in mind when reviewing the workbook. To see anything differently means to first see the meaning that has been given to it by the ego. For example: based on past experience, a table is seen as an object to place things on, although of itself the table has no meaning. In like manner, we think we know what everything in the universe is for. What we are not aware of, however, is the purpose given to everything by the mind, depending on its decision to side with the ego's goal--separation--or the Holy Spirit's--healing the separation. Nothing means anything because nothing outside of Heaven exists in reality; however, everything shares the purpose the mind attributes to it. Its meaning supports belief in the ego's thought system or the Holy Spirit's, Who has a correction for every meaning given to anything by the ego. Thus, His plan for the illusory world shares the purpose of God, because it leads us back to Him.",
    "output": "In the practice of the Course we are asked to recognize that we have given meaning to everything we perceive; justifying and defending this meaning (sometimes adamantly), and perhaps even refusing to question our interpretations. These are the blocks to allowing the Holy Spirit to transform the perception of illusion to the memory of reality so that we may awaken from the dream. All we are asked to do is have a little willingness to question our interpretation and ask for the Holy Spirit's help: \"The great Transformer of perception will undertake with you the careful searching of the mind that made this world, and uncover to you the seeming reasons for your making it\" (T-17.II.5:2). Accepting the Holy Spirit's plan of forgiveness for everything does not make the illusion real; it makes it useful: \"Illusion makes illusion. Except one. Forgiveness is illusion that is answer to the rest\" (W-pI.198.2:8-10). The love and gratitude that is brought to everything is found in forgiveness. To see everything differently is to see it in its light, the core of which is to recognize that nothing outside of the mind has any effect on it. This shift in perception removes all blame from the universe of relationships, places, and situations for the feelings we experience. Forgiveness, therefore, serves as a bridge between the illusory dream and the reality of Heaven, giving everything in the illusion a holy purpose. The bridge is needed because of the belief that the dream is real, and it indeed seems to be. When every illusion has been forgiven, everything will be perceived through the eyes of the love that was always present in the mind, with no effort on our part."

His readings, therefore, were not intended as a comprehensive philosophical or theological system, although there clearly are philosophical and theological aspects to the readings. He spoke of mind or thought as the builder, for example. In contrast, one of the purposes of A Course in Miracles is to provide us with a universal thought system that can be applied on the individual level of our everyday lives. In addition, reincarnation came up frequently in Cayce's readings, whereas in the Course reincarnation is not central to its teachings."

    "text_input": "Q #1206: What I've learned so far in studying A Course in Miracles is that there is no real love in this world, and that forgiveness cannot change anything in the world, only our perception of it. We then can look on devastation and know it is false; but we would still be \"seeing\" the devastation, correct? How does that work? In the crucifixion, for example, was Jesus, as the observer, watching it all happen, as the apostles later reported \"seeing it,\" while at the same time untouched by it? No fear? No pain?",
    "output": "Yes, you are correct about there being no real love in this world. The reason is that this world was made by our minds (and remains in our minds, since ideas leave not their source) to cover the guilt we felt over having destroyed the Love of God. Of course the Love of God cannot be destroyed, but we believed we did it and now are dealing with the consequences of that belief. But we always retain in our minds the memory of our true Identity as one with God, and by choosing to have Jesus be our teacher and model, we can learn to be reflections of that love by undoing all the barriers we have built to hide it--barriers made of judgment, specialness, hatred, and the wish to be separate. But the love is in our minds, not the world. In your second point you appear to be referring to one of the Course's definitions of the miracle, which emphasizes its role as a correction: \"It does not create, nor really change at all. It merely looks on devastation, and reminds the mind that what it sees is false\" (W-pII.13.1:2-3). Jesus then speaks of forgiveness as \"the home of miracles\" (W-pII.13.3:1); therefore, it does not change anything in the world, only the perceptions in our minds. Remember, \"There is no world! This is the central thought the course attempts to teach\" (W-pI.132.6:2-3); so Jesus would not be teaching us how to change things in the world when he knows there is no world. But since we believe there is a world, he helps us see that it is but a projection of our own minds, and that we give it all the meaning it has, and that is what he wants us to focus on: the world \"is the witness to your state of mind, the outside picture of an inward condition ... Therefore, seek not to change the world, but choose to change your mind about the world\" (T-21.in.1:5,7). We first accept the ego or Jesus as our teacher; then our perception or interpretation of what our eyes see reflects that choice: \"Perception seems to teach you what you see. Yet it but witnesses to what you taught. It is the outward picture of a wish; an image that you wanted to be true\" (T-24.VII.8:8- 10; see also T-21.V.1:7; W-pII.304.1:3). Your eyes could be looking at the twisted wreckage of cars and bodies on the highway, for example, but your perception/interpretation of this event would depend on whether you have chosen the ego or Jesus as your teacher. If you are perceiving with Jesus, your inner peace would not be affected by the outer events, which does not mean, however, that you might not stop and offer assistance if you could--we are talking only about the content in your mind, not behavior. The ego's interpretation would always center on victims and victimizers, tragedy, loss, fear, anxiety--anything that would support the reality of separate bodies vulnerable to outside forces and conditions, making their peace and happiness dependent on these externals. (In this context, you might find it helpful to look at Questions #1111 and #1187.) Jesus was the perfect manifestation of love. As a totally healed mind--no ego with guilt to be projected--he could not fearfully or angrily experience himself as a crucified body or an unfairly treated victim, as he explains in \"The Message of the Crucifixion\" (T-6.I.5:3; 9:1-2). His mind could do only one thing: love. We are the ones who give form to that love, as our fear and needs allow. The problem we have in comprehending this is that we usually try to understand it from our reference point as bodies. But it can never be understood on that level because our perception of ourselves as bodies is itself a choice to separate ourselves from our minds and from the truth. So our concentration should be on the process of forgiveness, which will undo the many ways in which we interfere with love's communication in our minds. A clear understanding of these \"theories\" will then emerge. Several other questions provide a comprehensive discussion of the crucifixion and Jesus' life from the point of view of A Course in Miracles: see, for example, Questions #401b, #505, #510, and #563."

    "text_input": "Q #1207: When setting goals that are crucial to my own well-being and future as well as to my family, I feel guilty--thinking that as a Course student I am doing something wrong by setting \"worldly\" goals when I should simply have the one goal of looking with Jesus at my ego. How  can one sensibly integrate having goals and be a serious student of the Course, without the ego coming in and making a mess?",
    "output": "A Course in Miracles is not opposed to setting goals or anything else we do in this world. Jesus lets us know this through statements such as, \"All things you made have use to Him [the Holy Spirit], for His most holy purpose\" (T-14.VI.5:3). In other words, Jesus wants us to keep doing all the things that bodies normally do, but to allow the Holy Spirit in our mind to change the purpose. This is why he tells us, \"'What for?' ... is the question that you must learn to ask in connection with everything\" (T-4.V.6:7-8). Basically, from Jesus' perspective, whether we spend our days attempting to achieve ambitious goals, watching TV, or sitting in silence on a mountain is irrelevant. It is with which internal teacher we do these things that matters to him. It is true that from the ego's perspective, everything we do or achieve here represents our triumph over God. And if you set goals with the ego, then undoubtedly you will find yourself trying to get your needs met at someone else's expense--and feeling guilty as a result. But if you set goals (and try to achieve them) with the Holy Spirit as your Guide, each worldly goal can serve to help you remember the one true need we all share--the need to realize that God's Love still exists and it is safe to awaken from this dream. If your overarching goal is to remember this one shared purpose, then there will be no cause for guilt over all the other things you do. One final note: As a serious student of the Course, you should always begin with the premise that the ego will come in and make a mess, but that this phenomenon is not serious. The messes the ego creates simply show us that we became afraid of God's Love and ran to the ego for protection. As soon as we realize we have done this, we can once again drop the ego's hand and take the Holy Spirit's. And then the mess will look like a simple pile of silliness that the love in our mind can easily show us how to clean up."

    "text_input": "Q #1208: I am wondering if Jesus is leading us directly into temptation, in a way, in his use of the word \"magnitude.\" Couldn't he have used the word \"importance\" such as in the metaphor of Indra's net where each is like a mirror in a net of mirrors and so each one is of complete importance? But can not the hearing of magnitude, as commonly understood, lead directly into grandiosity? Can not the language about one's special function also lead to grandiosity? I am thinking that there is a raising, in tenderness, of the meek and teachable state and, as \"pride goeth before the fall,\" there is an inevitable course to grandiosity. And, is it possible, that beyond simply allowing for the lessons of grandiosity to take place, Jesus in this Course, by the use of such language, may be actually leading us into them, when we are so inclined!?",
    "output": "It is the nature of language that there is always the possibility of misunderstanding and misinterpretation, and this possibility of course extends to the concepts and symbols that Jesus uses in A Course in Miracles. And he is certainly not unaware of the ambiguity of words and their potential for confusion, for he says of words that \"they were made by separated minds to keep them in the illusion of separation\" (M-21.1:7). And so your question is whether a word such as magnitude may have a heightened risk of misinterpretation and misuse. What is essential throughout the Course is to understand just whom Jesus is addressing and what his purpose is. If we read almost any passage from the mistaken perspective of ourselves as bodies, we will misunderstand and can use it to reinforce our specialness. Consider for example \"I am the light of the world\" (W-pI.61.title) or \"Salvation of the world depends on me\" (W- pI.186.title), both of which could be said to describe our special function. Jesus follows each of these workbook lesson titles, with which the ego could have a field day, with clarifications that make it very clear that he knows what our egos would like to do with these statements, but that he is not referring to the self that we think we are. And furthermore, that it is arrogance, not humility, that would deny these statements about ourselves. So, for example, in Lesson 61, he says, \"Who is the light of the world except God's Son? This, then, is merely a statement of the truth about yourself. It is the opposite of a statement of pride, of arrogance, or of self-deception. It does not describe the self-concept you have made. It does not refer to any of the characteristics with which you have endowed your idols. It refers to you as you were created by God. It simply states the truth. To the ego, today's idea is the epitome of self-glorification. But the ego does not understand humility, mistaking it for self-debasement. Humility consists of accepting your role in salvation and in taking no other\" (W-pI.61.1-2:1-3; italics added). And for Lesson 186 Jesus similarly explains, paradoxically from an ego perspective: \"Here is the statement that will one day take all arrogance away from every mind. Here is the thought of true humility, which holds no function as your own but that which has been given you ... Our minds are suited perfectly to take the part assigned to us by One Who knows us well ... Today's idea ... does not ask that you be different in any way from what you are. What could humility request but this? And what could arrogance deny but this? ... Arrogance makes an image of yourself that is not real ... Salvation of the world depends on you, and not upon this little pile of dust\" (W-pI.186.1:1-2; 2:7; 3:1-5; 6:1; 7:4; italics added). So considering the concept of magnitude, we must understand that Jesus is using the word as a correction for our belief in our own littleness, \"for the separation was a descent from magnitude to littleness\" (T-10.IV.8:5). Littleness refers to our belief about ourselves, originating with our belief that we are separate from the great and glorious Whole that is our reality, and culminating in our experience of ourselves as impotent bodies and personalities, confined in our existence to a limited space in a body, living within a very brief interval of time. And then if we read the Course from the perspective of this false ego-self, that we are bodies, which most of us almost certainly will do at first, we will misinterpret Jesus' words when he attempts to share what is the truth about us. For the magnitude Jesus is describing refers to our minds when we are no longer limited by all our false beliefs of separation and its seeming consequences. While it may seem, as you say, that Jesus is leading us directly into temptation, since he knows with what false beliefs our minds seem to be circumscribed, there nevertheless is a valuable pedagogical purpose in his seeming seduction of our ego. For if we are sincere students of the Course, there will develop a growing awareness of our ego's efforts at grandiosity, and in our right minds we will recognize that something is amiss if we find ourselves believing in our own specialness. We can only fool ourselves for as long as we want to. And only by looking directly at our ego's deceptive manipulations and strivings, including its attempts to co-opt the Course for its own purpose, will we be able to learn to make a different choice, against all the various forms of littleness that the ego offers us. Jesus is clear that we cannot make the choice against littleness alone. And so he counsels us: \"Be not content with littleness. But be sure you understand what littleness is, and why you could never be content with it. Littleness is the offering you give yourself. You offer this in place of magnitude, and you accept it. Everything in this world is little because it is a world made out of littleness, in the strange belief that littleness can content you. When you strive for anything in this world in the belief that it will bring you peace, you are belittling yourself and blinding yourself to glory. Littleness and glory are the choices open to your striving and your vigilance. You will always choose one at the expense of the other ... All your striving must be directed against littleness, for it does require vigilance to protect your magnitude in this world. To hold your magnitude in perfect awareness in a world of littleness is a task the little cannot undertake. Yet it is asked of you, in tribute to your magnitude and not your littleness. Nor is it asked of you alone. The power of God will support every effort you make on behalf of His dear Son ... In your practice, try to give over every plan you have accepted for finding magnitude in littleness. It is not there. Use the holy instant only to recognize that you alone cannot know where it is, and can only deceive yourself (T-15.III.1; 4:4-8; IV.4:5-7). An honest reading of these sections could only expose any ego attempts to interpret magnitude as an aspect of our limited self. And if we still choose to give such interpretations to such passages, it can only mean that we are still too afraid to accept the unlimited magnitude of Wholeness that Jesus is offering us. And that may be foolish, but it is no sin."

But I think that this is not a concern as once this \"life\" terminates then I have the option to listen to the ego and choose another illusion or the Holy Spirit and realize that I am one with God. There is really nothing to remember about the Course because whenever I come back there will always be a message showing me the way back. In one of these illusions I actually realize my oneness and the dream ends. Is that about the size of it? A: Yes, you've pretty much got the right idea, especially at the content level. And the good news, which can be said with certainty, is that you're not coming back into another illusion! Now that's not the same as saying you're going to awaken this time around, but rather it's true because you've never come into any illusion in the first place. We always remain within the mind outside the illusion, viewing it and perhaps identifying with it, but never truly entering it. And, as you say, both options--the ego and the Holy Spirit--will always be available to you-- with the correction for the ego experienced in some specific form, such as the Course. But these alternatives are always available because they are nothing more than projections or manifestations of the two thought systems that are always available within our minds, regardless of which illusory life we may happen to be reviewing.",

    "text_input": "Q #1210: Some years ago, I went through some things that in which it seemed to me that lessons in faith were played out before me, many of them centered on my sons and their drug addictions. There seemed to be immediate responses in the world--a counselor calling to tell me that my son was doing so well, dolphins jumping high into the air--when I would \"let go\" or release the whole thing to mystery. In one last episode, I was commiserating with a friend. We were at Universal Studios. I was sitting on a planter in a patio with my head down in despair. Instantly an actor dressed as Groucho Marx sat on my lap and, flicking his cigar, said \"There's no hope for Ben, hey?\" I imagine our mouths hung open.  I would interpret this and many other events as the Holy Spirit intervening in the world or maybe, to be more, specific, in salvation. Yet, I hear you say that the Holy Spirit does not intervene in the world. Can you qualify this statement to integrate with my experience? Is there a difference between that actor doing what he did and Helen doing what she did for us? Isn't the Course itself an intervention into our world?",
    "output": "As you begin to recognize more and more that you are the dreamer of this dream that we call our lives, and not one of the figures in the dream, you will understand that you, as mind, are the one who chooses the symbols that you will experience, just as you do in your sleeping dreams at night. While we believe we are bodies, we think that there is very much that is external to us, including the Holy Spirit and Jesus, and that they are agents who can intervene in our world, either at will or at our invitation. But the symbols are our own production. The only meaningful difference among them is whether we allow our minds to be guided by the Holy Spirit or by the ego as we choose and then, most importantly, interpret the symbols we experience. The ego's interpretation will reinforce our belief in the reality of separation, while the Holy Spirit's will very gently lead us to awakening from the dream of separation. And so, as we are willing to practice our lessons of forgiveness, we may experience seemingly external symbols, as you have, while we believe we are bodies, that seem to remind us of and reinforce our decision to forgive, just as when we choose to judge and condemn, we may see external symbols that reinforce our decision to separate and hate. After all, \"projection makes perception,\" as Jesus notes twice in the Course (T-13.V.3:5; T-21.in.1:1). But in either case, it is our mind that has chosen those symbols and chosen the teacher who will interpret their meaning for us. There is nothing special or mysterious about this process, except that we have chosen to keep our own responsibility for our experiences hidden from ourselves. The Holy Spirit does not intervene in the world because there is no world--only a dream in our mind that seems very real while we remain asleep. The Holy Spirit does not intervene in our minds either, although the Course in places describes the Holy Spirit as if He does. This is simply a literary device Jesus uses at times to make it clear that we are not in charge of our own salvation, in the sense that anything we think we can do on our own must by its very nature involve our ego, that is, the part of our mind that believes we can be on our own and separate from God. The Holy Spirit represents that part of our mind that knows otherwise. And so by relinquishing our need to be in control, to be in charge, we allow another part of our mind to remind us of the truth about ourselves, opening our mind to gentler symbols and, most importantly, to gentler interpretations of all of the symbols we have projected within our minds. Many passages in A Course in Miracles elaborate on what we have been describing, but let's consider just two of the clearer statements. In \"The Responsibility for Sight\" in Chapter 21, we find the following emphatic declaration: \"I am responsible for what I see. I choose the feelings I experience, and I decide upon the goal I would achieve. And everything that seems to happen to me I ask for, and receive as I have asked ... It is impossible the Son of God be merely driven by events outside of him. It is impossible that happenings that come to him were not his choice. His power of decision is the determiner of every situation in which he seems to find himself by chance or accident ... Suffer, and you decided sin was your goal. Be happy, and you gave the power of decision to Him Who must decide for God for you\" (T-21.II.2:3-5; 3:1-3,5-6). And later in the text, in \"The Dreamer of the Dream,\" Jesus notes: \"You are the dreamer of the world of dreams. No other cause it has, nor ever will ... So fearful is the dream, so seeming real, he [the Son of God] could not waken to reality without the sweat of terror and a scream of mortal fear, unless a gentler dream preceded his awaking, and allowed his calmer mind to welcome, not to fear, the Voice that calls with love to waken him ... Accept the dream He gave instead of yours. It is not difficult to change a dream when once the dreamer has been recognized. Rest in the Holy Spirit, and allow His gentle dreams to take the place of those you dreamed in terror and in fear of death\" (T-27.VII.13:1-2,4; 14:1-3). Note that while this passage makes it sound as if the Holy Spirit is the author of the gentler dream, as already discussed, this is merely a way to remind us that we must not decide on our own what the content of our dreams should be, for we will look for symbols that answer our needs from the perspective of the ego, thus reinforcing our belief in the reality of the separation. Joined with the Holy Spirit, that is, the part of our mind that knows the separation is not real, we will see the world in a completely different light, not colored by the filter of our own personal needs. Again, to understand fully what Jesus is saying in these passages, it is paramount that we know that he is addressing the mind. The selves we believe we are, bodies with special, unique personalities, are the dream figures--the effects--and have no power to dictate anything about what our experience shall be. They only carry out the directions the mind gives. Once we begin to accept that, the mystery of our lives and our experiences will begin to fade. Chapter 17 of Kenneth Wapnick's book, Absence from Felicity, contains a more in-depth discussion of these and related issues, including how to view Helen's scribing of the Course from the perspective of the Course's uncompromising nondualistic metaphysics."

    "text_input": "Q #1211: Could you please explain the following passage:",
    "output": "\"A solid foundation is necessary because of the confusion between fear and awe to which I have already referred, and which is often made. I have said that awe is inappropriate in connection with the Sons of God, because you should not experience awe in the presence of your equals. However, it was also emphasized that awe is proper in the Presence of your Creator. I have been careful to clarify my role in the Atonement without either over- or understating it. I am also trying to do the same with yours. I have stressed that awe is not an appropriate reaction to me because of our inherent equality. Some of the later steps in this course, however, involve a more direct approach to God himself. It would be unwise to start on these steps without careful preparation, or awe will be confused with fear, and the experience will be more traumatic than beatific\" (T-1.VII.5:1-8). A: Jesus first spoke of awe in the second section of Chapter 1, where he emphasized that it is not an appropriate reaction to him or to miracles: \"You are a perfect creation, and should experience awe only in the Presence of the Creator of perfection ... Equals should not be in awe of one another because awe implies inequality\" (T-1.II.3:3,5). Jesus is thus setting the stage for developing a relationship with him, and correcting the traditional biblical view that he is God's only beloved Son, and we are inferior to him. If we listen carefully to what he is saying and do what he says, we will learn to trust him as our loving brother, knowing that he is always there as a source of comfort and guidance in all things. We will be less and less afraid of him and his message as we learn he is simply reflecting back to us what we have denied about ourselves. As we settle more into this relationship and become more comfortable with his message, we will be prepared for the steps he will ask us to take later. We just need to be humble and patient, and not try to jump quickly to the top of the spiritual ladder before we are really ready for that level. We will then be able to allow the memory of God into our awareness with a minimum amount of fear. It will feel more natural, and not something imposed on us. We will accept our love for Him as our Source and Creator, and His love for us as the extension of His Love. This awareness now inspires awe in us, as it should; but awe does not entail fear unless we still believe we are somehow separate from God. Thus, at the very beginning of the text, Jesus is cautioning us not to rush our study and practice, and not try to make ourselves spiritual on our own. We must first learn how to deal with our egos and all the barriers we have erected between ourselves and God's Presence. If we were ready to leap right back into Heaven, we would not be here thinking we are bodies in a real physical world. Patience, gentleness, humility, and trust are essential in these early stages of our work with A Course in Miracles."

    "text_input": "Q #1212: The scribing of A Course in Miracles, Jesus' interaction with Helen, and the Course itself as a physical book seem to be very specific and not abstract. The Course is here in the world in front of us. It tells us how to do the workbook lessons, how the world is, and how the ego operates in the dream, etc. How is this so if God is not aware of the dream, or of us as dreamers, and if God, the Holy Spirit, and Jesus are non-specific and therefore do not operate in the world or the dream, as opposed to the ego which is specific and does? I was wondering if perhaps our right mind, in a way, could be said to work in the world, or the dream, when we are able to see the dream for what it is, particularly by decisions we make as we see things",
    "output": "differently, having different outcomes as a result, on the level of content and also on the level of form at times. I heard Ken speak of the Course coming through Helen's right mind or the One Mind, with Jesus being used as the symbol of God's Love in that process. This explanation of Helen would seem to indicate that the right mind can work in the world. Could you comment on this in relation to the origin of ACIM, the Holy Spirit, One Mind or right mind working in the world or dream idea? A: Jesus tells us in one emphatic statement why the right mind could never work in the world: \"There is no world! This is the central thought this course attempts to teach\" (W-pI.132.6:2-3). Add to that the following key Course principles and it is unmistakably clear that there has to be another way of understanding how the right mind works: \"[the world] is the witness to your state of mind, the outside picture of an inward condition\" (T-21.in.1:5). Ideas leave not their source. Therefore, as a projection of the mind, the world is only an effect, not something real that can interact with, or influence the mind in any way (see also T-21.II.11). The right mind is the part of the split mind that retains the reflection of our unseparated state, our true Identity as God's Son, eternally one with Him. When we (the decision maker) choose against the other part--the ego--then our internal experience would reflect the oneness we have denied, which means we would know--or at least begin to realize--that nothing outside our mind has any power over us, because there is nothing outside. In the context of sickness and healing, Jesus expresses this radical principle: \"He [all of us] looks on what he chooses to see. No more and no less. The world does nothing to him. He only thought it did. Nor does he do anything to the world, because he was mistaken about what it is [a projection]\" (M-5.II.3:6-10). Our perception, therefore, reflects only the choice to identify either with the thought system of separation or the correction of that (the Atonement principle that defines the right mind): \"It [perception] is the outward picture of a wish; an image that you wanted to be true\" (T- 24.VII.8:10); \"For seeing can but represent a wish, because it has no power to create. Yet it can look with love [the right mind] or look with hate [the wrong mind], depending only on the simple choice of whether you would join with what you see, or keep yourself apart and separate\" (T- 31.VII.12:5-6). Strictly speaking, therefore, A Course in Miracles did not come into the world, nor does its practice aim at changing the world. In fact, we are asked to reorient our entire approach to our lives: \" ... seek not to change the world, but choose to change your mind about the world\" (T- 21.in.1:7). The Course, thus, can be seen as one reflection in the mind of God's Son of his choice to accept the truth instead of denying it. It is in a specific form because of what we have done to our minds (W-pI.161.2); but it will lead us beyond specifics as we become less fearful of letting go of our defenses against the truth. Our preoccupation with form (specifics and time) is the reason the Course takes the form it does. It is we who limit abstract love to forms consistent with our belief in an external world that affects us. As we practice forgiveness, however, our preoccupation with specifics will gradually shift to a preoccupation with the content in our minds, and then we will perceive the world and ourselves in a completely different way. The world will change, but only in the sense that our perception of it will have changed. We will no longer perceive ourselves as being at its mercy, imprisoned by it as innocent victims. Our internal experience of seeing our interests as joined with everyone else's--and the love that inspires that--will be what attracts us more and more. In other words, we will be, by choice, oriented more inward than outward, more toward spiritual vision than toward what our eyes see. Ken's book Absence from Felicity, especially Chapter 17, gives a comprehensive account of how the Course came through Helen. This is also presented in Chapter 5 of Few Choose to Listen, Vol. 2 of The Message of A Course in Miracles, where, in Chapter 4, you can also find an explanation of the Holy Spirit's nature and role. Additionally, you may find it helpful to look at Questions #328 and #544."

    "text_input": "Q #1213: I understand that our interpretation of things must change, but that outer conditions won't necessarily change as a result. Yet I also understand, in the cinema analogy, that what we see cannot be different from what the film in our minds projects onto the screen of our experience. I also understand that concern with how long the shift of purpose in a relationship takes--and I believe this refers to perceived results of that shift--is of the ego. Nevertheless, the Course does hold out the eventuality of the \"happy dream.\" Does that occur only when the ego ceases to want it? Why do specific patterns exist in our personal dreams? Is there a simple answer to why it takes time for changes to appear, if they ever do, since they are supposedly reflections of consciousness and the miracle of conscious reorientation takes no time? A: The only meaningful change that can take place is the decision to choose against the ego and for the Atonement, the undoing of the belief in separation. The \"happy dream\" spoken of in A Course in Miracles flows from this choice, and pertains only to one's inner experience or perception. It has nothing to do with what our eyes see, the seemingly real external world. It is natural, in our separated state, to want things to go well in our lives in the world (whatever that may mean). But as we work more and more with the Course, we learn that the source of true happiness and peace is our decision to forgive, which means we would increasingly see our interests as the same as everyone else's. This is the happy dream--where our joy comes not from anything external, but from the internal awareness that we have been mistaken about the world and who we are, and that the truth is that we all share the same interests, and, ultimately, the same Identity as God's one Son. Sometimes, this shift in awareness is reflected externally, because when we let go of guilt, we will no longer act in hurtful ways, toward ourselves and others. For example, if I have been engaged unconsciously in a specialness bargain or a victim-victimizer bargain with another person, that other person may change when I choose to no longer uphold the bargain. But you have to be careful not to make judgments based on form--appearances in the world. We do not see our own or anyone else's full path, and so we cannot judge why lessons appear as they do. It could be that some people have chosen to learn through ongoing physical or psychological suffering. That may be their path. We don't know that, so we should not attempt to draw conclusions about their spiritual progress on the basis of the external patterns and conditions. It is fairly common for people to experience specific recurring patterns in their lives such as rejection, abandonment, abuse, or failure, for example. We all have a deeply repressed layer of guilt over our belief that we rejected God and our Identity as His Son, having thrown away our inheritance of eternal love and peace. The overwhelming guilt over that and the subsequent fear of punishment causes us to project responsibility for this \"sin,\" which means we would always",
    "output": "be seeking to blame someone else for it. Thus, in order to deflect the blame for my rejecting God and Love, I would experience myself as being the innocent victim of other people's insensitive rejection of me. So, until I am open to the idea of projection, and then can look at my own guilt with Jesus or the Holy Spirit, I will have the unconscious need to be an innocent victim. \"It's not my fault!\" will be my theme song, and I will have no awareness of the origin of this recurring pattern. It cannot be said too often that a favorite ego lure is judging according to form, and that is why the lessons in A Course in Miracles are exclusively about the content in our minds. The early lessons, especially, are helping us to see that the inner and the outer are the same. That is hard for us to relate to, for it reverses what we have learned in the world. Progress in this course rests on our openness to seeing our lives in the world as the result of the choices we make in our minds. And we always make one of the only two choices available to us: to perceive everything in terms of the ego thought system of separation, or in terms of the correction of that, the Holy Spirit's thought system of forgiveness."

    "text_input": "Q #1214: Have animals chosen their own scripts? Why is the focus limited to forgiveness of the people in our lives, with no mention made of the treatment of animals. The attributes of God's teachers, gentleness in particular, seem to be towards our fellow man. Animals in this world live a daily holocaust at our hands, and seem to feel pain, and believe they are here. This bothers me tremendously, and I cannot figure out how to think about it. Are they not also our brothers?",
    "output": "Yes, they are also our brothers. We have discussed this topic in our answers to two earlier Questions: #134 and #340; and it is also discussed in #20 (\"What is meant by the Sonship, and who or what is included?\") in our book The Most Commonly Asked Questions about \"A Course in Miracle.\" As we explain, animals are part of the fragmented Sonship, just as we are, and therefore they should be thought of in the same way. True forgiveness is universal; it excludes no part of the Sonship. Animals are not discussed in the Course specifically, as its primary focus is the healing of our relationships with one another. Recall its origin in Helen and Bill's decision to find a better way of relating to each other and their colleagues. But the same principles are applicable to animals, although one must be careful not to approach this from the perspective of form, which would only lead to confusion when thinking about issues such as scripts, as we (homo sapiens) are the ones who introduced the idea of different species and orders, such as animate and inanimate. Focusing on purpose will help you stay on the right track: Am I giving the ego's purpose of seeing separation and victimization to my relationship with animals, or the Holy Spirit's purpose of learning that all separation is illusory? By thus focusing on the content in your mind, you will be more apt to see all beings as having a common origin and a common goal."

Is that use of magic any different from the countless more common methods of magic that all of us use every day to some extent? For example, one Course student may put on his best suit, think positively, and prepare what he feels are some impressive answers before going to a job interview, while another may light a candle, meditate, or perform some magical ritual in order to prepare. Both are using means they feel could influence the outcome; both are attempting to exercise their will within the world, and I presume, one method is not more real than the other, given that nothing here is really real.",
    "output": "Our answer to #124 explains the concept of magic as it is used in A Course in Miracles. It is important to note that the Course's use of the term is different from its ordinary use in the world. In brief, magic in the Course refers to our attempts to use physical means to solve a problem that exists in the mind. We thus try to solve the problem of the guilt in our mind in the world or the body, where it does not really exist. Again, #124 provides the full explanation of this with several references to the parts of the Course that address it. We also talk about the Course's teaching that the use of magic is not wrong, and, in fact, is unavoidable because of our fear of accepting healing solely at the mind level, and because of our investment in believing the body is our real identity. Feeling guilty about the use of magic is a mistake and never justified, but we do need to recognize the difference between true healing and false healing. You can practice magic in any form and be a devoted student of A Course in Miracles, just as you can be a dentist and be a devoted student of A Course in Miracles. What can help to resolve any conflict surrounding this is focusing on the purpose of what you do. Anything we do in the world can be used by the Holy Spirit, if we so choose, to help us undo our belief in separation. It is always a matter of the purpose we choose to identify with in our minds. Fortunately, there are only two: the ego's or the Holy Spirit's. We use what we do either to reinforce our mind's belief that we are separate from one another and God, or to undo that belief by learning how to recognize that our interests are not really separate, despite the differences in form. You are correct in saying that, from the Course's point of view, there are no degrees of reality when it comes to the different forms of magic that we use. In content, they are all the same; and they are all illusory. There is no hierarchy of illusions--one illusion is not better or worse than any other illusion. It is important to respect those differences in the world, however, as long as we think the world and our lives as individuals are real--to ignore this dimension is to confuse levels. The body is not real, but as long as we think it is, then we must take care of its needs. In the same vein, there are some behaviors that are appropriate in certain situations and others that are not. As Course students, again, our primary focus is on our use of the body and our interactions in the world, and this is always a matter of the choice we make in our minds to keep our separate, special identities intact or to gradually let go of our need to see ourselves as separate and special."

    "text_input": "Q #1216: Once I am willing to see that the hatred, jealousy, and ill-will that an individual is projecting at me is really my own unconscious thoughts about myself, and my own unconscious guilt--does this mean these thoughts are now conscious, and if so now what do I do? I still have the hatred and anger towards those who are trying to hurt me even though I have an intellectual understanding that it is myself being jealous and hating, and hurtful of myself. How do I heal it? How do I give it over to the Holy Spirit to heal my mind so that the guilt is healed.",
    "output": "Yes, the projected thoughts of hatred become conscious when they are recognized as projections. A missing piece in the equation is to then see them as the effect of the mind's choice, and to also recognize the painful price of this choice. Hatred is experienced as painful whether it is perceived in its projected form toward someone else or toward oneself. The choice for separation is the true source of the pain, hatred, and the guilt. Your insight into the difference between an intellectual understanding of the projections and their actual release is very important. It is often difficult to truly accept that \"anger is never justified,\" yet in this principle lies the key to healing. The problem is that it is not easy to accept because it negates the ego's battle cry of victimization. The mind that has identified with the ego thought system revolts at the prospect of accepting its identity as mind and dissociating from the body identity. Anger, judgment, and guilt sustain this identity. Jesus recognizes the intensity of resistance to his message: \"If sickness [anger, judgment, victimization] is but a faulty problem-solving approach, it is a decision. And if it is a decision, it is the mind and not the body that makes it. The resistance to recognizing this is enormous, because the existence of the world as you perceive it depends on the body being the decision maker\" (M-5.II.1:5-7). As \"intellectuals,\" our job is done when we are willing to see the projections and recognize their true source. As students of A Course in Miracles, our job begins when we are willing to recognize the tremendous resistance to letting go of the hatred and making a choice against separation because it means the end of the ego thought system and the self that reflects it. That is where you find yourself. The only thing to do with resistance is see it, acknowledge it honestly to the Holy Spirit, and see the pain that persists because of it. Only in associating the painful effects of the hatred and the resistance to letting it go will we find the motivation to take the steps out of resistance to the acceptance of healing. Meanwhile, we have the agonizing predicament of wanting release from the pain of guilt without letting go of the guilt. The unhealed mind has an intense identification with the body that cannot be undone forcefully. While fear persists, only gentle patience will facilitate the journey out of it. The way to give the process over to the Holy Spirit is to continue to look honestly at the ego's antics, the resistance to letting them go, and the painful conflict that ensues without judging yourself for it. He is invited in by the mere fact of turning away from the ego's tune of victimization with a little willingness to acknowledge the mind's choice. Consistent practice of this process is in itself a new perspective, and makes room for the Holy Spirit's healing. Nothing more than this is needed."

    "text_input": "Q #1217: Years ago, during an intense time of spiritual searching but prior to my introduction to A Course in Miracles, I had a stunningly realistic dream in which I was standing in a field, looking at a black portal in the sky, being held open by two beings whom I couldn't see, and being urged, by a third unseen spirit, to pass through to the beautiful light beyond. I remember experiencing stark terror--a mortal fear--at the prospect of somehow getting through all that darkness by myself. The gentle but firm coaxing I understood to be from Jesus, who told me that others had gone before, to be met with untold happiness, and I could do so as well, but that no one could do it for me. My question is this: was the terror I felt at the thought of passing permanently through that darkness related to a concern of my individuality being annihilated, and, if so, please explain the concept of self. In Lesson 84, Jesus encourages us to say, \"I will worship no idols, nor raise my own self-concept to replace my Self.\" The Course teaches that in the real world we have no individuality as we think of it now. In light of that, please explain the concept of Self to which He refers in this quote. A: First of all, your interpretation of your dream sounds pretty accurate, including your observation that your fear is of loss of your individual self at the thought of passing beyond the darkness into the light. Our egos would like for us to believe that we are really afraid of the",
    "output": "darkness--the seemingly impenetrable clouds of guilt that we have made real by our investment in the thought of separation as sin. But that is the cover for the real fear, the fear of oneness. The self with which we identify is the false individual self we have made for ourselves by joining with the illusory ego, to prove that the separation is real and that we are limited and tiny and vulnerable. The body serves this purpose quite nicely. There are in fact many layers to this false self, as the section \"Self-Concept versus Self\" (T-31.V) makes clear. Our Self, as the Course uses the concept, is our true identity as Christ, the holy Son of God, who remains one with the Father, untouched and unaffected by any illusory thoughts of separation, sin and guilt (W-pI.95.12,13; W-pI.201.1:3-6). Ultimately, even words and concepts such as these are illusory, for they remain within a dualistic framework, but point to something beyond. There is no Self that can be defined apart from God, but while we believe in a separate self with all its limiting self-concepts, the concept of a Self, which ultimately is beyond all concepts, provides a helpful correction for the false beliefs with which we have circumscribed ourselves. And so statements in the Course, such as the one you refer to in Lesson 84, are meant to help us release or undo these false concepts so that they can be first replaced with helpful concepts (healed perception), before we release all concepts and \"return\" to our reality of oneness (knowledge beyond all perception). Towards the end of \"Self-Concept versus Self,\" Jesus provides a helpful contrast between the false self we have made, with all its various faces, and our true Self, God's one creation, beyond all concepts: \"The concept of the self has always been the great preoccupation of the world ... Salvation can be seen as nothing more than the escape from concepts ... Seek not your Self in symbols. There can be no concept that can stand for what you are ... And you will not perceive that you can interact but with yourself ... You will make many concepts of the self as learning goes along. Each one will show the changes in your own relationships, as your perception of yourself is changed. There will be some confusion every time there is a shift, but be you thankful that the learning of the world is loosening its grasp upon your mind. And be you sure and happy in the confidence that it will go at last, and leave your mind at peace ... There will come a time when images have all gone by, and you will see you know not what you are. It is to this unsealed and open mind that truth returns, unhindered and unbound. Where concepts of the self have been laid by is truth revealed exactly as it is ... There is no statement that the world is more afraid to hear than this: I do not know the thing I am, and therefore do not know what I am doing, where I am, or how to look upon the world or on myself. Yet in this learning is salvation born. And What you are [the Self] will tell you of Itself\" (T-31.V.14:1,3; 15:1-2,5; 16:1-4; 17:2-9). When you experienced yourself as having an opportunity to pass through the darkness to the light, your ego interpreted that as the path to self-annihilation, as it tried to persuade you that this self is something. The fear you experienced is what Jesus makes reference to when he speaks of \"no statement the world is more afraid to hear.\" While we still value the little false self, we will be afraid of anything that is dismissive of that self. And so we will also approach the Course with ambivalence and fear, for ultimately its purpose is to teach us but one thing, summed up in a simple statement that comes near the very end of the workbook: \"Let me not forget myself is nothing, but my Self is all\" (W-pII.358.1:7)."

    "text_input": "Q #1218: A Course in Miracles says it is a universal experience, yet it is Christian-based. How do I tell my Church leaders that the Course works with Christianity and other religions, too? Do people from other religions or faiths accept the Course as valid? How do they make it work in their minds? How do they explain it to their church leaders?",
    "output": "To respond to your inquiries, let's first take a look at the passage you're referring to for clarification, because you've jumped to some conclusions that don't necessarily follow from Jesus' statements: \"Theological considerations as such are necessarily controversial, since they depend on belief and can therefore be accepted or rejected. A universal theology is impossible, but a universal experience is not only possible but necessary. It is this experience toward which the course is directed. Here alone consistency becomes possible because here alone uncertainty ends\" (C- in.2:4-7). In other words, Jesus is saying here that there will never be agreement among different religious and spiritual teachings at a theological level, for they all use concepts and symbols specific to their own cultural and historical contexts to explain the nature of God and our relationship to Him, and belief is the basis for accepting or rejecting the various teachings. But what all genuine spiritual and religious teachings share is that they are leading to an experience of oneness and love, which is universal, since such an experience is not dependent on symbols or words, and in fact transcends anything specific. Nearly all the major religions of the world have their mystics, and when you get beyond the specific words, drawn from their own religious and theological backgrounds, if they attempt to describe their mystical experiences, you will find that every mystic, regardless of the specific spiritual path or religion, is sharing the same universal experience. The Course, while using Christian terminology, does not use those terms in the same way as traditional Christianity, and in fact often uses them in a way that is intended to correct what are perceived as the errors of Christianity, from the Course's perspective. And so there are significant theological differences between the Course and all the various Christian sects, which in fact do not agree with each other. Any attempt to reconcile the differences between the Course and traditional Christianity is likely to be unsuccessful. (See Kenneth Wapnick's book A Course in Miracles and Christianity: A Dialogue, co-authored with Jesuit priest and scholar, Father Norris Clarke, for an in-depth discussion of many of these theological differences.) With these thoughts in mind, let's turn again to your question. First of all, the Course is not claiming to be a universal experience, but only one path among many (see M-1.3,4 for a discussion of the Course's position on this) that leads toward that experience. It is not intended to be integrated with other religions or spiritual paths, but stands on its own as a self-study spiritual teaching that helps its students get in touch with their own Inner Teacher, replacing the teacher that they have made for themselves (the ego). While it is certainly possible to practice the Course while remaining among the faithful of any particular religion, it will become more difficult to remain faithful to the tenets of that religion as the principles of the Course are integrated more deeply into one's practice and experience. For the Course's theology is very different from nearly every other religion of the world, including and especially Christianity. Since the Course is only for one person--the individual student who is studying it and practicing it--and it is not intended to form the basis for any mass movement or new religion within the world, your concern about how to share it with church leaders is really unnecessary. You may find there are times when you feel drawn to share aspects of your path with a church leader, but you should not be surprised if often they will not be receptive to its message, since it says something so very different from traditional Christianity (e.g., sin is not real, God didn't make the world, and Jesus is not God nor our personal savior who died for our sins!). It should be a relief to know that, as a student of the Course, there is no one else that you need to inform or persuade. And from a metaphysical perspective, the Course means that quite literally--there is no one else--another significant difference from Christianity and most other world religions!"

    "output": "A Course in Miracles teaches that the ultimate cause of all anxiety, pain, and suffering is the mind's decision to choose separation and abandon the Father's Love. That is what got us here in this world, which is racked with pain. One of the very important goals of the Course is to teach us the real cause of pain (the mind's choice for separation) from the apparent cause (a person or event external to the mind). This distinction is at the heart of the process of forgiveness. It is often very helpful to identify the apparent cause of suffering, because in it lie the specific grievances that the ego is using to keep pain alive. The mind uses pain to defend its belief that the dream of separation is real and suffering is justified. This is its excuse for continuing to choose separation and deny that any other choice is possible. Being willing to see this defense system in operation and recognize its devious purpose is the beginning of its undoing. However, as you mention, it is not always possible to identify the specific apparent cause of suffering, and it is not necessary to do so: \"It is not necessary to follow fear through all the circuitous routes by which it burrows underground and hides in darkness, to emerge in forms quite different from what it is. Yet it is necessary to examine each one as long as you would retain the principle that governs all of them. When you are willing to regard them, not as separate, but as different manifestations of the same idea, and one you do not want, they go together\" (T-15.X.5:1-3). This means that it is important to look at any thoughts of judgment, annoyances, or upsets that are associated with recognizable causes. They are at the root of the experience of unexplained suffering while the ultimate cause remains the mind's choice, as we mentioned earlier. Judgments and grievances that are tucked away, overlooked, or denied, are the cause of undefinable anxiety. They are the source of guilt, as Jesus tells us: \"Of one thing you were sure: Of all the many causes you perceived as bringing pain and suffering to you, your guilt was not among them. Nor did you in any way request them for yourself. This is how all illusions came about. The one who makes them [the decision-making part of the mind] does not see himself as making them, and their reality does not depend on him. Whatever cause they have is something quite apart from him, and what he sees is separate from his mind. He cannot doubt his dreams' reality, because he does not see the part he plays in making them and making them seem real\" (T-27.VII.7:4-9). Thus, it is important to recognize that suffering plays an important role in keeping the ego thought system intact. That is not to say that you should not do whatever is helpful to alleviate the form suffering takes, which may include seeking counseling or therapy to uncover the possible apparent cause. The Course is not meant to replace the many things that provide comfort and relief from the anxiety and pain of believing we have abandoned God. It does offer ultimate relief by leading us out of the dream of separation, but that is accomplished in a gentle, gradual process of practicing forgiveness by searching the mind carefully for the judgments that keep the memory of God from awareness. If we are willing to question them, seeing them as the reflection of the mind's choice, we open the door to the Holy Spirit Who will release them. Guilt is thus diminished and eventually undone, along with the suffering that is its effect: \"Bring, then, all forms of suffering to Him Who knows that every one is like the rest. He sees no differences where none exists, and He will teach you how each one is caused. None has a different cause from all the rest, and all of them are easily undone by but a single lesson truly learned. Salvation is a secret you have kept but from yourself\" (T-27.VIII.12:1-4)."

Not quite; but it has become clear a whole lot of unconscious emotional factors come into play. With the woman that I have just been involved, I find myself questioning her motivation, and then wondering about my own as well.",
    "output": "Although the specifics will change over time with our various special relationships, the underlying dynamics, content and purpose will remain the same, so long as we continue to employ the ego as our guide and teacher in approaching our relationships. It's helpful to recognize that specialness is always at the foundation of any relationship we pursue, no matter how we go about doing it. For the underlying premise is that I am incomplete in some way, and that I want and need someone else to help give me a different feeling or experience from what I am now experiencing. In other words, the motivation is always some sense of lack--always! And while we believe at the very core of our existence that lack is our reality, Jesus is asking us to consider the possibility that it is really a lie. It would be a mistake, however, to think that A Course in Miracles is telling us not to pursue special relationships--Jesus needs our special relationships as the classrooms in which he can teach us our lessons of forgiveness. For special relationships, no matter what their form, allow us to get in touch with our own underlying guilt--the source of our feelings of lack and need, which always motivate us to seek outside ourselves. At this point it does not matter what the form of your relationship with this woman may be. Its value lies in the opportunity it has provided for you to recognize how effective the ego is in tying you up in knots when you seek to listen to its counsel. When we are willing to turn to a different Teacher, we will begin to understand that relationships are never really about anyone but ourselves. They are the mirrors we can hold up to look into the depths of our own unconscious mind and see what darkness is still lurking there. Intense feelings such as you describe around such relationships are not the result of past experiences in previous relationships, but rather result from the intensity of our belief in own guilt and unworthiness, having their ontological origins in our belief that we could separate from and attack Love. No wonder, with that belief, we will sabotage all of the relationships we pursue in a hopeless attempt to find outside of ourselves what we secretly accuse ourselves of having destroyed within and thrown away. So, while we don't want to try to make ourselves stop any of the craziness we are pursuing in our special relationships, we do want to learn to step back from what seems to be going on and watch what we are doing with a certain sense of nonjudgmental detachment. If we can recognize our insanity without judging it, it will begin to lose its power and its appeal to us and we will find ourselves less inclined to act out our ego fantasies of conflict and victimization. Increasingly, we will find we can enjoy relationships simply as the joining of mind with mind, each whole and complete in itself, each seeking simply to extend the love that is already present within. And if the other does not seem to reciprocate, we will not experience it as an evaluation of our own worth, but rather as a call for the love that they have forgotten is already theirs. This shift from a special to a holy relationship is beautifully described at the beginning of Chapter 22 of the text: \"Who has need for sin? Only the lonely and alone, who see their brothers different from themselves ... For an unholy relationship is based on differences, where each one thinks the other has what he has not. They come together, each to complete himself and rob the other. They stay until they think that there is nothing left to steal, and then move on ... A holy relationship starts from a different premise. Each one has looked within and seen no lack. Accepting his completion, he would extend it by joining with another, whole as himself. He sees no difference between these selves, for differences are only of the body. Therefore, he looks on nothing he would take. He denies not his own reality because it is the truth. Just under Heaven does he stand, but close enough not to return to earth. For this relationship has Heaven's Holiness. How far from home can a relationship so like to Heaven be?\" (T-22.in.2:1-2,5-7; 3) To get more clarity about the purpose our egos give to our relationships, you may wish to check into either the book or the audio set Form versus Content: Sex and Money."

    "text_input": "Q #1221: Sometimes I'm just depressed, and I'm not quite sure how to look at it. I feel that any direction is wrong, that if I read or listen to A Course in Miracles, I'm unable to live up to its expectations, then I calcify even more, thinking, \"Okay, since I have to accept choosing the separation as my responsibility, I must want to be depressed.\" So two questions: (1) Could experiencing bouts of depression be part of one's script? In the same way that any other \"event\" might be? If so, then is it just a matter of accepting it and not fighting? Or am I deluding myself and not looking deeply enough? (2) Is it always a matter of having faith and hanging on through the discomfort? How does one know if this is the layer of fear that Jesus talks about going through--as in those cloud banks, etc.? A: Basically, if we can take Jesus at his word, all of us, most of the time, whether we recognize it or not, are walking around feeling either angry or depressed, or perhaps angry and depressed (T- 12.III.6:1-3; T-29.IV.3:3). After all, everything in the ego thought system comes from guilt, and if we internalize the guilt, that's depression, and if we externalize or project it, that's anger. We cover those feelings over as much as we can with thin veils of apparent pleasure, Jesus also tells",
    "output": "us, but you don't have to scratch very far beneath the surface to find the anger or the depression (T-29.IV.3:4). So, in a sense, yes, you could say depression is just part of our script, once we choose the ego, just as having a body is. In fact, Jesus explains, \"When you equate yourself with a body you will always experience depression. When a child of God thinks of himself in this way he is belittling himself\" (T-8.VII.1:6,7). And it seems likely that, until we near the end of our journey, we will continue much of the time belittling ourselves, seeing ourselves as bodies. Jesus describes this overriding identification: \"You still have too much faith in the body as a source of strength. What plans do you make that do not involve its comfort or protection or enjoyment in some way? This makes the body an end and not a means in your interpretation, and this always means you still find sin attractive ... There is one thing that you have never done; you have not utterly forgotten the body. It has perhaps faded at times from your sight, but it has not yet completely disappeared\" (T-18.VII.1:1- 3; 2:1-2). Yes, if we feel depressed, it can only be because we want to be depressed. But that's because we're also saying we want to be an individual, a vulnerable, helpless body, but we're not allowing ourselves to see the connection between that choice and the depression (T-12.III.6:5-7; T-21.V.2:3-7). It would be a mistake, however, to think that the Course, or Jesus, has expectations of us that we are failing to meet. Only the ego has expectations against which we can be measured and judged. Jesus describes in uncompromising terms how our choices affect us, but he is not judging or condemning us for our foolish decisions. They are almost unavoidable while we persist in identifying with the ego and its seeming effects, for the learning situation with the wrong teacher must be depressing and hopeless (T-8.VII.8; 13:1-3). The Course process is not to deny that we are bodies but rather to seek Help in undoing the guilt in the mind that makes the need for a defense such as the body seem necessary. So it would be best not to make too big a deal of our depression, trying to figure out how to deal with it or get rid of it, as the ego delights in our doing, as if the depression itself were the problem. When we attempt to do anything about any ego state, even seeking a so-called spiritual solution, such as turning to the Course itself, we only reinforce our feelings of emptiness and inadequacy, because we are making the problem real and still putting ourselves in charge of the solution. And then nothing we decide to do will help, as you have found. Rather than trying to fight or change or minimize depression, it is more helpful simply to recognize that it is merely a symptom of a faulty choice in the mind--choosing the wrong teacher. And so the goal then becomes, not to escape the depression, but to make a different choice in our mind. The choice for a different Teacher is reflected in those holy instants, which we open ourselves to when we simply say \"no\" to the ego and \"yes\" to the Holy Spirit. And in those instants the body recedes in importance in our perception, at least momentarily. \"You are not asked to let this happen for more than an instant, yet it is in this instant that the miracle of Atonement happens. Afterwards you will see the body again, but never quite the same. And every instant that you spend without awareness of it gives you a different view of it when you return. At no single instant does the body exist at all\" (T-18.VII.2:3-5; 3:1). It is then simply a matter of not judging ourselves for choosing the ego and all its effects, including depression, and then having faith--in the process of forgiveness--that over time, our investment in the ego will recede as we look directly at it and eventually through it. Our own resistance is the clouds of guilt and the layers of fear that we must pass through. From where we stand on the ego side, it all looks dark and foreboding and impenetrable, but from Jesus' perspective it is all as substanceless as clouds (T-18.IX.8). That is why we cannot let go of the ego and all its effects, including depression, on our own, and why we need the help of a Guide, such as the Holy Spirit or Jesus, Who is not fooled by the illusion. And then gradually, like the fog in the morning sun, our depression will dissipate and lift in the light of true forgiveness and healed perception. By the way, since we will continue to identify ourselves as bodies for much of our journey back home, it only makes sense that we be open along the way to seemingly external interventions that can help ameliorate painful symptoms we may be experiencing, such as depression. If you find your bouts of depression are interfering with your normal functioning, you may wish to consider seeking some form of treatment, including therapy and medications, such as antidepressants. And you may also find the answers to some previous questions on depression helpful, including Questions #352, #257 and #128."

    "text_input": "Q #1222: When I perceive an attack that seems totally unwarranted--and this can be a mere comment someone makes that makes me feel invalidated--my reaction is one of intense anger and hatred to the point that, if I could and get away with it, I would kill the other person. With these feelings of invalidation and indignation, I can feel like a door mat. This is a sticking point for me, because if I don't succumb to the anger and attack back, and I pray to the Holy Spirit for help instead, I just feel flat and unmotivated, and feel like trash.  As I understand it, what has happened is the experience of indignation and invalidation is just my own guilt and fear projected outward and the situation provides the opportunity to become aware of my unconscious self-deprecation, and that the people that appear to be doing it to me are not the true cause. Although I understand this intellectually, when it happens, this understanding seems to have very little power or strength in relation to the intensity of emotion, and does little to transform the pain.  I greatly desire to know a way I can follow that can help me to truly forgive and to transform the energy of this guilt/anger into the vitality and love that I seek. I want to know that, yes, forgiveness truly works through experience of applying and practicing it.",
    "output": "There is another aspect to the guilt in your mind that may help you understand why it is so difficult to let go of your anger when you feel you have been invalidated by the other person. Your unconscious guilt--which can also be called self-hatred--leads you to expect to be mistreated because that is what your guilt tells you you deserve. This is true of all of us, of course, who believe we attacked God and separated from Him. You would not be affected by the other person's attack unless, unconsciously, you thought you deserved it. In your right mind, where you identify with your guiltlessness as a Son of God, you would not take an attack personally, and you would see the fear in the other person that is behind the attack. This is why Jesus tells us in A Course in Miracles that \"no one can be angry at a fact. It is always an interpretation that gives rise to negative emotions, regardless of their seeming justification by what appears as facts. Regardless, too, of the intensity of the anger that is aroused\" (M-17.4:1- 3). Related to this is another dynamic that is described in the section in Chapter 31 called \"Self- Concept versus Self\" (T-31.V). The concept described there, \"the face of innocence,\" is one most students wish they had never come across. It is a devastating revelation about us, although it ultimately is our way out of the hell of situations such as the one you describe. The gist of this idea is that concealed beneath our protests of being the innocent victim of another's cruelty is a wish that we be unfairly treated so that we can blame that person for our lack of peace and happiness. Upon hearing this for the first time, most people strenuously object: \"That's impossible! Why would I deliberately want to suffer at another's hand? That makes no sense.\" It doesn't make sense from our perspective. But in light of the ego's strategy, it makes perfect sense. As you stated, you realize, intellectually at least, that you have projected your guilt onto the other person, which is how the ego assures you that you will regain your innocence--that other cruel person is the victimizer, not you. What follows from this is that deep inside you, therefore, you must want to be unfairly treated. You have to suffer at the hands of a victimizer if you are going to be the innocent victim, according to the ego's twisted logic. This is difficult to swallow, but it is essential to include in your understanding of projection. As you are able to look at this aspect of guilt, you are giving yourself another way of handling your anger. It does not take away your anger, but it helps you not justify it. That does not seem helpful, but it is very helpful, in that it gives you a better chance at getting at the real cause of your anger. The way your ego has led you to see things, no matter which path you take, you wind up as the loser. On the one hand, if you forgive by letting the other person off the hook, you feel like a door mat and trash. But if you don't forgive, your anger just saps your energy and you just surrender, while your guilt stays intact in your mind. With true forgiveness, no one loses. You just look at what your ego is doing without judging yourself. If you are not judging, then you are in your right mind with Jesus or the Holy Spirit. Even if this is for a split second, you have made significant progress toward disidentifying with your ego, identifying with the ego being the real problem, not what the other person said or did. In that instant, you would be peaceful, having glimpsed your own innocence, which is shared by everyone. You do not forgive the other person, you forgive yourself for having believed that your guilt is real and that you needed to so something about it (the defense of denial and projection). This takes a lot of practice, but Jesus guarantees our success, because all we are doing is reclaiming the guiltlessness that is our true identity. Who can invalidate you if God Himself guarantees your innocence (W-pI.93.6)? This can happen only if you forget who you are, and then give power to someone else to make you into a door mat, which can happen only in a dream or fantasy (T-4.I.7). We have discussed many of these ideas in Questions #63, 551, and 569."

    "text_input": "Q #1223: I had an experience of God recently that I don't know how to connect with my work with A Course in Miracles. Briefly, here is what happened. My cat, Ben, became seriously ill, and I was terribly upset. After leaving Ben in the care of the veterinarian, I returned home, still very anxious, and I found myself repeating, \"Please forgive me, Ben, I am so very sorry.\" I did this for hours, as if compelled to. Then I became aware that I was directing this to myself--that I  was sorry to the core of my being for the harm I had done to myself over many years of abuse. Then came a powerful feeling that I was not alone. I experienced this as God, and for the first time in my life I felt alive and real. The power of His presence was beyond words. I was nothing; but I was everything. Fear did not exist, and there was a realization of beauty in death and in all things. This lasted for the weekend, but after that I felt very vulnerable, and my defenses built up again. I am still seeking to recover that feeling of being so real and alive.",
    "output": "Without knowing a great deal more about you, it is difficult for us to say what all of this means for you specifically. We can simply point out a few concepts and teachings in the Course that we hope will be of help. First, Jesus reminds us that we are \"very new to the ways of salvation\" (T-17.9:1), which means if a profound experience does not last, such as the one you had, then it can serve the purpose of showing us what our permanent experience will be as we continue to get in touch with the interferences that must still be operating in our minds. He describes this in another place in the text in terms of light and darkness: \" ... the journey into darkness has been long and cruel, and you have gone deep into it. A little flicker of your eyelids, closed so long, has not yet been sufficient to give you confidence in yourself, so long despised\" (T-18.III.3:3-4). The experience you had seems to be much more than \"a little flicker of your eyelids,\" but that assessment is from our point of view, not from where Jesus is outside the dream. It may be helpful to read this entire section, \"Light in the Dream,\" as you will see there that Jesus is very encouraging, and is basically saying that our unconscious fear of total release causes us to retreat back into darkness after we glimpse the light. He assures us that we will succeed, however: \"But you will advance, because your goal is the advance from fear to truth\" (T-18.III.2:2). Notice, though, that in this section Jesus does not advise us to concentrate on God, but rather on our relationships--looking for grievances we are holding onto, or something else that would keep us separate from others--perhaps feeling that some people do not deserve to experience God's Love and peace. Our fear of release is expressed that way, and therefore if we focus on becoming aware of what is keeping us separate from others, and then look at all that with Jesus or the Holy Spirit (which means without judgment), we will be letting go of what is blocking our awareness of God's Love and peace that is reflected in our right minds. Patience and gentleness are essential as you proceed with this process."

    "output": "This thought comes from the famous statement in Matthew's gospel that the last shall be first and the first last (Mt 20:16). This is the foundation of the ego's thought system and its principle of one or the other--God is second because the ego is first, which means God is no longer God, and so has been destroyed. A Course in Miracles helps us recognize and correct our mistake of believing we have separated from God and thus are in \"first place\" because we triumphed over Him. Jesus tells us in this lesson, as well as elsewhere, that we believe our autonomy is our salvation, but it is not really what we thought it would be: \"Yet all we find is sickness, suffering and loss and death\" (W-pII.328.1:3), which is not at all what God wills for us. We choose the second place by realizing our mistake, letting go of the ego, and choosing Jesus as our teacher. Then we realize that there is only the unity of the Father and Son--no one and two. There is only One. When we accept God as our Cause instead of the ego, the memory of our oneness with Him returns to our mind, and our will rejoins His."

    "text_input": "Q #1225: The lesson \"I am under no laws but God's\" (W-pI.76) implies, among other startling powers, that we don't need to eat. A Course in Miracles has been around long enough and supposedly practiced by millions, and so it would seem that a few folks would not need to eat by now. A: Although demonstrations of being beyond physical laws may be helpful reminders to us, that really is not the point of this lesson. Jesus is simply stating the truth--that in reality there is no body, and therefore there can be no laws that govern it. This is what we refer to as Level One, where Jesus contrasts truth and illusion. Level Two discussions are only about the illusory realm, where he contrasts the ego's thought system of separation (wrong-mindedness) and the Holy Spirit's thought system of Atonement (right-mindedness). Thus, by reminding us in this lesson that what we believe in is not really there, he is helping us develop a different perspective on our seeming lives in the world. Unfortunately, far too many students have missed the distinction between Level One and Level Two, and therefore have wound up denying their physical and psychological experiences, to the detriment of themselves, their families, friends, etc. They have forgotten that Jesus stated early in the text that it is practically impossible to deny our physical experience in this world (T-2.IV.3:10). He never encourages us to deny our bodily experiences or our belief that we are individual persons living in a physical world. Rather than making fun of us or challenging us to give up our belief in the necessity of medical treatment, eating, breathing, earning money, and having relationships, he is helping us learn how not to take it all so seriously, recognizing where our investment in that belief is coming from (the dynamics of the ego that govern the wrong-minded part of our split mind). The body and its seeming laws are not the problem, in other words. The problem is our unconscious need to believe that we are not as God created us, and, as a means of dealing with the guilt over that, we are instead bodies subject to laws not of our own making. To correct this, our attention therefore has to be re-directed from the body to learning how to become aware of our minds and our ongoing decision to uphold that thought system. That is why the emphasis throughout A Course in Miracles is on having us change our minds about the body--which means becoming aware of the purpose for which we constantly use the body. Thus Jesus says, \"You are asked to live so as to demonstrate that you are not an ego ... \" (T-4.VI.6:3); and this means looking at and eventually letting go of all the ways in which we keep ourselves separate from God and from each other--through judgment and specialness, for example. Similarly, in the context of relationships: \"Your question should not be, 'How can I see my brother without the body?' Ask only, 'Do I really wish to see him sinless?'\" (T-20.VII.9:1-2). In essence, thus, Jesus is teaching us in this lesson to look through his eyes at our dependency on all the laws we think bind us so that we can see the roots of this dependency in the guilt in our minds, and then give the purpose of forgiveness to all of our interactions in the world, thus allowing ourselves to accept the Atonement, the ultimate goal of our work with the Course and our relationship with Jesus. Kenneth has given an extensive commentary on this lesson in Volume 2 of his Journey through the Workbook of A Course in Miracles.",

    "text_input": "Q #1226: Please discuss gratitude and A Course in Miracles. Can we be truly grateful for anything more than the opportunity to forgive?",
    "output": "If by gratitude for the opportunity to forgive, you mean being grateful to each other for these opportunities, you have touched upon the essence of A Course in Miracles, which is forgiveness. In a recorded workshop called \"Our Gratitude to God,\" Ken discusses gratitude on three levels: our gratitude to God, to Jesus, and to each other. Just as forgiveness is the correction for the unforgiveness we feel, gratitude, too, is a correction. It corrects the ingratitude we feel on these three levels, and when our ingratitude is corrected, the need for gratitude disappears. This has nothing to do with Jesus or God needing our gratitude (see T-6.I.17)--it is just another dimension in the process of undoing the ego thought system in our minds. If ingratitude is seen as a cornerstone of the ego system, basically going hand-in-hand with judgment, attack, fear, and guilt, then love must come when we undo the ingratitude and allow ourselves to feel grateful to each other, to Jesus, and to God, because love has been hidden behind the ingratitude. Ingratitude is like a veil, and therefore, when the veil is gone, the Love of God can be experienced. In brief, the gratitude the Course asks us to feel toward each other is not for what you do for me or for the miserable way you have treated me. It is gratitude for being able to see in you a mirror of my own self. Seeing the \"sin\" in you, I know it is within me, and by changing my mind about you, I am changing my mind about myself. That is the source of our gratitude toward each other. Yet, I cannot forgive you without a loving Presence next to me, and so my gratitude to you is impossible without my also feeling grateful to Jesus or the Holy Spirit. I realize, in other words, that I cannot change my mind by myself, because it is my self that got me into this mess, that has accused you, and that believes I can do it on my own. Relying on this self will only serve to keep me in hell. Thus, I recognize not only that I cannot do this without Jesus, but also that I cannot do it without you, because you represent a part of my self that I have split off and pushed outside me. And until I recognize that you are not outside me, but are really a part of me, I will never know the Christ that I am. \"Your function here on earth is only to forgive him, that you may accept him back as your Identity. He is as God created him. And you are what he is. Forgive him now his sins, and you will see that you are one with him\" (W-pI.192.10:6-9). As we advance in this process of undoing the ego, our gratitude to Jesus will grow as we realize that despite all the awful ego stuff that goes on inside us, part of us knows he truly loves us, and that by accepting his love, we can accept the love that we are. This, then, does away with the ingratitude we have felt toward God, thanks to our acceptance of the ego's replacement for the true God. By reflecting Heaven's love in his relationship with us, Jesus helps us remember the deep gratitude we feel for God as our loving Creator and Source. For some further commentary, see #556, which contrasts the ego's version of gratitude with the Holy Spirit's. Excerpts from the audio album \"Our Gratitude to God\" are posted on our Web site under Learning Aids/Excerpts Series."

    "text_input": "Q #1227: I have a question about lights. I have been doing the Course for a very short time (about seven months), and I am already seeing light shows in my meditative states. I never experienced this before and I'm a little nervous. Although I do feel very peaceful, I'm still ready to run to the eye doctor to check and see if I have glaucoma or something! I still haven't seen light around the edges of things or anything really in the world of form, but when I lay down it's  showtime! My question really is this: Isn't it too soon for me to be seeing this stuff? It's a little scary sometimes and I don't know if it is real or somehow just a figment of my imagination. Why after just beginning A Course in Miracles would I have these episodes when others have been faithfully doing the course for years and don't seem to have these experiences?",
    "output": "Like everything else in the world of perception, once we have made it real in our minds, the lights you are seeing are in themselves neutral. And what determines their value is the interpretation you give them, which depends only on to which teacher you turn to give them their meaning. Turn to the ego and you will see them as evidence of your specialness, an interpretation you've already been in touch with when you believe they somehow make you different from, possibly even better than, other students who have been studying the Course much longer. By the way, although the wording of Lesson 15 may seem to suggest that experiences of light will be an outcome of practicing the Course's principles, you may find that the discussions of these kinds of phenomena, presented in Questions #218 and #339, can provide some helpful clarification. And so whether one experiences light episodes earlier or later in one's work with the Course, or not at all, in the end is irrelevant to the Course's genuine purpose, which is to teach us how to undo our investment in the ego and its thought system of separation and differences, through the practice of forgiveness--the releasing of all of our judgments. Turn to the Holy Spirit in your right mind, and your light experiences can become symbols that remind you that all perception is ultimately illusory--and that may be at least in part what you are finding so frightening about your experience--for the seeming external world of our perception is no more nor less a figment of your imagination than the flashes of light and flaming sparks you are seeing during your meditations with the workbook lessons. The light can also symbolize the little willingness needed to shine away the darkness of the ego's thought system of sin and guilt by looking directly at it and seeing through it (e.g., T-11.in.3). And, when seen through the vision of the Holy Spirit, it can also be a symbol of the formless light and love that is our reality as God's Son, an extension of His perfect Love (e.g., T-12.VI.7:2-3). Perhaps the most important thing you may wish to keep in mind about your experiences is that nothing of the world of perception is of any value in itself. If the experiences should continue for any time, simply enjoy them without making them a big deal. And if they should cease, nothing of value will have been lost."

A: First, if you have not done so yet, you might try going to a therapy center that works with abused women. That is often a good first step. Therapists and counselors with experience in this field can offer helpful resources, and sometimes they can advise you in terms of what to do and",
    "output": "what not to do in an abusive situation. Getting this kind of help would not be going against anything the Course teaches. In fact, Jesus tells us that using external sources of help is a wise thing to do, while we are also working on letting go of the ego beliefs in our minds (T-2.IV.4,5). Seeking and accepting help on this level can give form to your desire to be healed; it can be an act of kindness to yourself, which would be an important step in reversing the ego's image of you as guilty and deserving of punishment. The Course can help you learn how to interpret your experience differently. The early workbook lessons, especially, help us to practice what the text has taught us about this--namely, that perception is an interpretation, not a fact (see, for example, T-21.in.1; T-24.VII.8:10). This distinction between what happens in the world and the interpretation we give it is crucial to our understanding and practice of the Course's message. It is one of the most difficult teachings to apply, because it goes against what all the learning of the world has taught us. Vicious, cruel attacks take place. This cannot--and should not--be denied. But to go beyond that \"objective fact\" and say you are a victim is to give the fact an interpretation. Thus, Jesus teaches us in Lesson 5 that we are never upset for the reason we think (W-pI.5), and in Lesson 31 that we are not the victims of the world we see (W-pI.31). Upon seeing these lessons for the first time, many people think Jesus has lost touch with reality, or that he couldn't mean what he says literally! But he does mean it literally, having already explained the basis of those statements in the text--that the guilt in our minds is so intolerable that we must project it onto others, whom we then see as the guilty, victimizing ones. This is extremely difficult for us to process, and it becomes our lifetime's work. What enables us to deal with this is to remember always that Jesus, or the Holy Spirit, is with us each step of the way. His comforting, loving, non-judgmental presence will help us proceed gently and patiently, with the assurance that we are simply undoing mistaken beliefs in our mind, or to use the metaphor of the dream, gently awakening from a nightmare of sin, guilt, and fear. It is important to remember as well that this presence can come in the form of a caring, non- judgmental therapist, who can help you deal with your experience of abuse--all of the guilt, hurt, resentment, and rage. This often can be a helpful prerequisite for healing to occur."

This trend actually led to the scribed supplement The Song of Prayer, in which Jesus clarifies what he meant by prayer, forgiveness, and healing, addressing the misinterpretations that were spreading among students. Once you gain a sense of the full message of this course, you would know that it is definitely not about enhancing our lives as bodies in the world or about our behavior. It is not wrong to ask for specific help with specific problems--it is a helpful starting point on one's spiritual journey, for it encourages a perception of God as caring and loving, not punitive and judgmental. But, ultimately, our goal is to get back home to Heaven--to awaken from the dream that we are separate from Him and from each other. If we are always focused on specific concerns about our own and others' bodies, and on getting what we want in the world, then we will remain spiritual children, still seeing God, the Holy Spirit, and Jesus as separate from us. God is a loving Father Who takes care of me--I am separate from God; Jesus as an older, wiser brother who is guiding me--I am separate from him. Again, this is a good start in developing a relationship with God and with Jesus, but it is just the beginning. There is so much more. Compare what you have quoted from Lesson 71 with what Jesus says later in Lesson 133: \"You do not ask too much of life, but far too little. When you let your mind be drawn to bodily concerns, to things you buy, to eminence as valued by the world, you ask for sorrow, not for happiness\" (W-pI.133.2:1-2; italics added). He then goes on to list the criteria for finding out if what we are asking for will truly help us on our spiritual journey. And in one of the sections in the text that discusses what it means to ask the Holy Spirit for help, Jesus tells us that we do not really know what we need: \"For what you think you need [for example, ways to improve our lives in the world] will merely serve to tighten up your world against the light, and render you unwilling to question the value that this world can really hold for you\" (T-13.VII.11:6). He wants us to see that the only value this world has is to be a classroom in which we use our experiences to get us back to our mind, where we can then undo our belief in separation. Thus, he asks us to remember what we really want: \"The Holy Spirit leads me unto Christ, and where else would I go? What need have I but to awake in Him?\" (T-13.VII.14:2-3). Another lovely statement of this occurs later: \"For what but Christ is there to see and hear and love and follow home?\" (T- 24.V.6:6)--this comes in the context of Jesus urging us to look honestly at our quest for specialness, and the awful price we pay in the special relationships we value so much. There are many other passages like these that could be cited, but the point is that we need to view them in the context of the overall message and aim of the Course. We also need to remember, as Jesus explains at the beginning of Chapter 25, that in order to communicate with us, he needs to use terms we are familiar with, but these are always from our framework of dualism, not the pure oneness of reality, which we would be unable to understand (see T-25.I.5-7). So he must express his message in terms that are meaningful to us but that are not literally true. He thus has us say prayers to God to get us on the right footing with Him, but he also states that God does not understand words and does not hear prayers, and, even more devastating to us, He does not even know we are here-- how could He know about what does not exist? (See W-pI.183.7:3-5; 10.) Although we could go on with this for several more pages, we will stop here and refer you to other Questions where we have discussed these issues and provided additional references. We refer you to them for further study: #85, #336, #538, #555, #643. All of these issues are discussed in depth in Chapter 2 of Few Choose to Listen (Vol. Two of The Message of A Course in Miracles); the discussion focuses on the crucial difference between the form of the Course and its unchanging, consistent content."

But the thing is, most of the time I regard myself as being coerced by any person I interact with,  so I'm used to living like this and it is giving me trouble to do the lessons without this feeling. Is it all right to continue doing the lessons even if I do them uncomfortably?",
    "output": "It might help you to go back over each lesson with the intention of noticing how much Jesus emphasizes gentleness and patience. Focus on his loving nature as a teacher and guide who wants more than anything to help you let go of everything that is causing you pain. Try to sense his loving intention, totally free of judgment and coercion, even though you may not be used to feeling it in another person or in yourself. Then know that your feelings of coercion and discomfort are coming from your own guilt projected onto other people. That is exactly what Jesus wants to help you get past. So just look at those feelings as they come up; don't deny them and don't judge yourself for having them. You don't have to let go of them. It is important that you not force yourself to do anything--you never want to fight against yourself. But simply learning how to look at or observe your feelings is a big step in the process of releasing them to Jesus' love. Issues similar to yours have come up for other students. You might find it helpful to look at our discussions of these in Questions #71, 146, 184, 315, 934."

It would seem only God could do this. And this universe seems to be made of all the same stuff. What is it made of? I thought it was all made of God.",
    "output": "The complexity of the universe is deliberate, but it is not of divine origin. From the perspective of A Course in Miracles, the world is the result of a series of steps in the ego's strategy to obliterate from our awareness any sense of the oneness of reality and of the Sonship. \"The Substitute Reality\" in Chapter 18 explains this process of fragmentation and its result, along with the Course's approach to the reversal of fragmentation (T-18.I.4-6). When you think of it, inherent in complexity is separation, whether you are talking about the microscosmic or macrocosmic level. In addition, this complexity produces what seems like an infinite number of problems demanding our attention, just so that we can survive as individuals, as nations, as a planet, etc. This is also important to the ego's strategy, for as long as we, as physical-psychological individuals, are preoccupied with what is going on in the world (including our bodies), we will never go back into our minds and discover that all of our perceptions are chosen and deliver to us the experiences we want. \"Projection makes perception ... [the world] is the outside picture of an inward condition\" (T-21.in.1:1,5); \"[Perception] is the outward picture of a wish; an image that you wanted to be true\" (T- 24.VII.8:10). The world, thus, is not at all what it appears to be. It is the projection of a guilty mind seeking escape from its guilt and fear. As Jesus explains in a rather striking passage, \"The world you see is the delusional system of those made mad by guilt\" (T-13.in.2:2; see also W- pII.3.2:1). Safely mindless in the world, we are oblivious to our own mind and its power to choose the Holy Spirit's thought system instead of the ego's. Keeping this realization out of our awareness is the ultimate goal of the ego, and our continual involvement in an impossibly complex world is among its most effective ways of achieving this end. This is the direct opposite of Heaven, which is \"an awareness of perfect Oneness, and the knowledge that there is nothing else; nothing outside this Oneness, and nothing else within\" (T-18.VI.1:6). Our primary goal as students of this course, thus, is to learn to reflect this Oneness in our daily interactions by recognizing that we all share the same interests and the same split mind with the power to choose between the ego and the Holy Spirit. For further discussion of the relationship between God and the world, see Questions #764 and #904."

As much as I think he has some Course concepts right, I do not find his needing to talk about it non-stop and lecturing everyone helpful. He feels he can get people to understand the Course faster if they'll listen to him. At this point, after listening to him for years, I disagree, and I resist his lectures. He feels I should continue with the relationship and be open to letting him teach me. I enjoy his company when he is quiet and practices forgiveness instead of preaching at me and to others. The truth is I am having a hard time letting go of the relationship, or staying in it, and clearly I am not forgiving it! This relationship is very special and I know it. Can you shed some light on what I am doing to myself? A: What would help relieve a great deal of the pressure you are feeling is to simplify the issue. The issue is not really whether you should stay in the relationship or leave it. Instead, your focus should be on asking for help to free your mind of judgment--in other words, whether you stay or leave, you can do so without judgment. This is what we generally recommend to people who are in a quandary about whether or not stay in a relationship they experience as abusive or as uncomfortable. The lesson is that you can leave a relationship peacefully, or you can choose to stay in a relationship and be at peace. Asking Jesus or the Holy Spirit to help you on that level will take you out of the should-I-stay-or-should-I-leave bind you are experiencing.",

    "text_input": "Q #1233: Why did God create the Sonship?",
    "output": "A Course in Miracles speaks of God's Son in two ways: (1) as the creation of God in Heaven, the undifferentiated unity within the Godhead, wherein \"He makes no distinctions in what is Himself and what is still Himself. What He creates is not apart from Him, and nowhere does the Father end, the Son begin as something separate from Him\" (W-pI.132.12:3-4; see also T-2.I.1:1; T-11.I.2-7; T-28.II.2:1-2). The Son is the extension of God within the Godhead, \"a Oneness joined as One\" (T-25.I.7:1), a process we are incapable of comprehending in our separated state (see also W-pI.192.2:2). There is no \"why\" in creation, as it is purely internal to the Godhead. There is no \"why\" in shared Identity that communicates eternally. It is simply of the nature of Love to extend Itself. (2) The Course also speaks of the Son in a state of separation from God, a state that is purely illusory, as separating from Totality is an impossibility (the Atonement principle). The \"author\" of this existence is the ego, although to give it more credibility and validity, the ego encourages theologies that have God as the source of this existence, as in the Bible and other scriptures. Importantly, the Course does not use the term create or creation when talking about the separated Son's origin; it uses the word make instead. On this level--existence outside God's Being--the issue of \"why\" becomes very relevant, and has been the focal point of many, many studies for more than two thousand years. This, in fact, is the subject explored in Kenneth's comparative study, Love Does Not Condemn: The World, the Flesh, and the Devil According to Platonism, Christianity, Gnosticism, and A Course in Miracles. #198 briefly addresses this from the point of view of God's purpose in creating oneness."

    "text_input": "Q #1234: In my view, the physical world as illusory can be compared to a novel, which, to me means we could speak at least of a relative reality (the content of the novel), the subject studied by scientists, historians, etc. So, for example, there would be a precise sense to any assertion about the \"historical Jesus.\" I am disturbed by different accounts about the historical Jesus that contradict each other (in the Bible, in the Seth books, in the Cayce readings, in The Disappearance of the Universe, etc.). In my opinion only one of these, if any, can be true (in the illusory world). But a remark in chapter 1 of A Vast Illusion by Kenneth Wapnick, where he speaks about \"probable realities\" in the sense of the Seth books, seems to indicate that this interpretation is wrong, that a better analogy for the physical world would be a whole library of different novels. Does this mean that the contradictory accounts about the historic Jesus could all be true (in our illusory universe) in some sense? A: From the perspective of A Course in Miracles perception is always based on whether we are identified in our minds with the Holy Spirit's thought system or the ego's.",
    "output": "\"You see what you expect, and you expect what you invite. Your perception is the result of your invitation, coming to you as you sent for it. Whose manifestations would you see? Of whose presence would you be convinced? For you will believe in what you manifest, and as you look out so will you see in. Two ways of looking at the world are in your mind, and your perception will reflect the guidance you have chosen\" (T-12.VII.5). The ego thought system of separation rests on the reality of sin, guilt, and fear; and at the core of this system are sacrifice, judgment, specialness, and the body. Thus, anyone identified with that thought system would have a need to perceive Jesus or any other symbol of love and enlightenment in those terms in some way--and many variations and combinations are possible. The Holy Spirit's thought system of the Atonement, on the other hand, rests on the unreality of sin, guilt, and fear; and at the core of this system are forgiveness, all-inclusive love, shared interests, and the means for returning us to our reality as mind and spirit. Jesus thus would be presented, as he is in A Course in Miracles, as a reflection of the pure oneness of Love: as selfless, defenseless, with love and compassion for everyone without exception. But, as he tells us in the manual for teachers, the universal message of love represented by his presence in our dream can come in \"many thousands of other forms\" (M-1.4:2). A second major consideration is that a significant number of biblical scholars have concluded that very, very little is known about the historical Jesus--New Testament accounts of Jesus cannot be relied on for an accurate picture of his life and message. Because of this lack of \"objective\" evidence, there is no way of evaluating the contradictory accounts of the historical Jesus--there is nothing to compare them against. In A Course in Miracles, Jesus refers to many biblical sayings and teachings attributed to him and tells us what he really meant, and what he could not possibly have said. Lastly, also relevant to your interesting query is the Course principle, \"All thinking produces form at some level\" (T-2.VI.9:14). This is to say that for every thought there is a corresponding reality. Thus, any thought of Jesus in any mind would have some expression in the world of quantum physics. There is nothing in the Course about quantum physics, unfortunately; and so we must leave it at that."

    "text_input": "Q #1235: Could you please explain the following passages in the text of A Course in Miracles which refer to being in someone else's dream: T-27.VII.8.2; T-28.II.4:1).",
    "output": "It is important to be aware that Jesus is speaking metaphorically when he talks about us dreaming and awakening. We are all very familiar with our experiences of having dreams at night and then waking and realizing, \"Oh, it was just a dream! It wasn't real.\" Because that is such a common experience that we all can relate to, Jesus describes our spiritual journey as analogous to that type of an experience. The first passage comes in the section, \"The Dreamer of the Dream\" (T-27.VII), and the point being made is that the only way we can awaken is to learn that our lives are unfolding only in a dream we ourselves are dreaming. It appears that much of what happens in our lives is done to us, and that is what Jesus is referring to when he says we become part of someone else's dream--that we perceive ourselves as the victims of what other people do to us or what the world does to us. If when you are dreaming, however, you become aware that you are dreaming (a lucid dreamer), then eventually you would be able to control your dreams and make them anything you want them to be. At the end of this chapter Jesus summarizes this rather forcefully by stating, \"The secret of salvation is but this: that you are doing this unto yourself. No matter what the form of the attack, this still is true ... For you would not react at all to figures in a dream you knew that you were dreaming. Let them be as hateful and as vicious as they may, they could have no effect on you unless you failed to recognize it is your dream\" (T-27.VII.10:1-2,5-6). The second passage you refer to comes in \"Reversing Effect and Cause\" (T-28.II), and the point is basically the same--that we have left vacant our role as decision-making minds (the cause), and instead see our experience as the effect of what is done to us: \"Nothing at all has happened but that you have put yourself to sleep, and dreamed a dream in which you were an alien to yourself, and but a part of someone else's dream\" (T-28.II.4:1). As we know ourselves now, we are alien both to our true Self as Christ (\"you have put yourself to sleep\"), and also to the power in our split mind to change our identification from the ego thought system of separation to the Holy Spirit's thought system of forgiveness. If we reverse our thinking that we are victims of what others do to us (i.e., that we are part of someone else's dream), then we begin the process of restoring our role as decision-making minds. Using the metaphor of dreaming again, Jesus thus says, \"Yet if you are the dreamer, you perceive this much at least: that you have caused the dream, and can accept another dream as well\" (T-28.II.5:2). Jesus then goes on to teach us about the role of the miracle in this process: \"The miracle establishes you dream a dream, and that its content is not true\" (T-28.II.7:1). This shift frees us to continue our process of removing all that stands in the way of our remembering the Love in which we were created and in which we forever remain."

    "text_input": "Q #1236: I've heard it said that we don't see with the body's eyes. Could it be possible, then, for someone who lost his eyes to see like any other?",
    "output": "In one sense, yes; in another sense, no. A non-sighted person can \"see\" like a sighted person on the level of content (mind), but not on the level of form (sensory data). A Course in Miracles teaches that perception is always an interpretation, not a fact; therefore both sighted and non- sighted persons can have similar perceptions. Both can learn to \"see\" that we all share a common interest and that what separates us is illusory. This would be known as right-minded perception or vision, which is not physical sight. In one passage Jesus tells us: \"The unreal or the real, the false or true is what you see and only what you see. Perception is consistent with your choice, and hell or Heaven comes to you as one\" (W-pI.130.10:2-3). This applies to both sighted and non-sighted persons, since Jesus is always speaking about our inner experiences, not what our physical eyes see. Remember, the world (the stimuli that seem to affect our senses) is not what it appears to be: it is \"the outside picture of an inward condition\" (T-21.in.1:5). The body does only what the mind tells it to do, as the body is simply a projection of the mind, not an autonomous entity. The body's sensory apparatus is made by the ego to follow certain \"laws\"; thus, a person who \"has lost his eyes\" will not have visual data, and in that respect will not \"see\" what a sighted person sees. The bodily limitations we have are part of our own script, our mind's choice. Our function, then, as students of A Course in Miracles, is to learn that the peace of God within us can in no way be affected by bodily conditions. It is a terribly difficult lesson, but that power of choice is our path to salvation. \"I will remain forever as I was, created by the Changeless like Himself. And I am one with Him, and He with me\" (W-pI.112.2:2-3)."

Regardless of whether they are a projection of our collective mind, I do think that they must be purged in the same way that all fascists must. I read about how monks and other devout groups prayed for the peace during the holocaust, but peace (relative though it was) came only with war. Of course, this is causing my already split mind to separate like orange sections.",
    "output": "Your perception of terrorists is the critical factor in resolving your dilemma; and as the Course teaches, perception can be either right-minded or wrong-minded--the same behavior (form) can flow from either the right mind or the wrong mind (the content). From what you say, you apparently perceive terrorists and fascists as victimizers, which means you have chosen the ego as your teacher. The ego never lets us in on this, but perpetual conflict, not enduring peace, is the inevitable outcome of its thought system, because it rests on the divisive principles of one or the other, kill or be killed. There must always be an external enemy of some kind for the ego itself to survive, and we are thus lured into thinking that if we can just get this person or this group out of our lives, everything will be better. But as you have observed, the peace that follows war is partial and never lasts. This will always be the case until we turn inward and see the insanity of this thought system, and then reconsider our choice for the ego as our teacher. This is where A Course in Miracles is most helpful, as its focus is on training us to make the connection between our experience and the thought system we have identified with in our minds. This is why Jesus tells us, \"Therefore, seek not to change the world, but choose to change your mind about the world\" (T-21.in.1:7). The insane belief system in our minds that claims peace can be attained through war and that we can stop hostility and hatred by killing people is the problem. The \"other way\" presented in the Course rests on the premise that we are all one as God's Son, and that there are no exceptions to this. Terrorists and fascists are part of the Sonship the same as everyone else, and therefore to condemn them in our minds is to condemn ourselves, and Jesus as well. If this vision is your point of departure, you are giving yourself a better chance of ending the conflict and pain in your own mind, for you would be proceeding on the basis of truth, not its denial. Then you would approach problems differently. Your response would be motivated by a sincere desire to heal, rather than a desire to eradicate the evildoers in the world, whom you see as the cause of unrest and fear. You would not deny the ego in anyone, but you would see it as the same ego in you (in content, not necessarily in form), and you would realize that violent, hateful behavior is coming from a mind that is itself tortured with pain and conflict that seems unbearable and therefore must be projected. From this place of compassion in your mind, you would thus be a channel for true justice, which does not see winners and losers, victims and victimizers, but rather, from a larger perspective, what is best for everyone: \"Be certain any answer to a problem the Holy Spirit solves will always be one in which no one loses. And this must be true, because He asks no sacrifice of anyone. An answer which demands the slightest loss to anyone has not resolved the problem, but has added to it and made it greater, harder to resolve and more unfair ... The principle that justice means no one can lose is crucial to this course\" (T-25.IX.3:1-3; 5:4). That is what Jesus means by \"returning justice to love.\" The last four sections in Chapter 25 help us understand the basis of the world's notion of vengeful justice, in contrast to Heaven's justice, which is rooted in all-inclusive love and compassion (T-25.VI,VII,VIII,IX). Lesson 200, \"There is no peace except the peace of God\" (W-pI.200), is also important for understanding the major differences between the peace we seek in the world and the peace we find within our minds--our natural inheritance as God's Son. \"For peace is union, if it be of God\" (W-pI.200.11:6). These issues are the subject, as well, of our audio sets, \"The Compassion of the Miracle,\" \"The Quality of Mercy,\" \"The Problem of Evil,\" and \"Justice Returned to Love.\" We also direct you to the Index of Topics, where you will find additional questions and answers under the listing, War."

Could that mean that on some level in our mind we get to a point (while here, experiencing living in a body) that we say, \"I am done with this,\" or does our dying (death of the physical body) happen at whatever point in time as a result of making the first decision to become a body? I would appreciate it if you could give me your understanding of this statement. A: This statement about dying is best understood in the context of the only two purposes we can ever choose to identify with in our minds, and which we are always choosing between at every instant. We are always choosing either to reinforce our belief in separation or to undo it. Thus, death can come upon the completion of our forgiveness lessons, as explained in The Song of Prayer: \"a quiet choice, made joyfully and with a sense of peace, because the body has been kindly used to help the Son of God along the way he goes to God\" (S-3.II.2:1). Understand, though, that this expresses the content in the mind only; the form could be cancer, a stroke, or any number of other ways in which the body ceases to function. The form does not necessarily indicate the content in the mind. The purpose of a fatal illness could also be ego based--a way of punishing oneself or others, for example. It is always a choice, though. With regard to the second point ... Since the mind is not bound by time, there is no predetermined time for the death of the body. To use the analogy of a video library, there are multiple videos of death, and the decision maker can choose any one of them, depending on the purpose it has identified with. But all of this occurs outside time and space, so it is practically impossible for us to comprehend it in our present state.",

    "text_input": "Q #1240: I am increasingly having problems with obsessive-compulsive hoarding disorder as I age. I'm currently 61 years of age. Are there any teachings in A Course in Miracles that can help me better understand the roots of my problem?",
    "output": "Our experience of ourselves as real individuals in a physical world means that we have identified with the ego thought system in our minds. That in turn means that in the core of our being there is a sense of lack, accompanied by searing pain that we are compelled to defend against. The source of this is the self-accusation--also deeply buried in our minds--that we got to be who we are as individuals by separating from our Source, thereby rejecting our Identity as Christ in favor of an autonomous, special existence that we thought would give us what we judged we could not get as part of God. As a result of this rejection of our true Identity and our true home, we would have to feel that there is something seriously wrong internally--a lack of enormous proportions. The pain of this is made worse by the overwhelming guilt we experience over having judged what we did as unforgivably sinful, intensified even more by the fear of punishment and retaliation by God Who will surely one day take back the existence we wrongfully acquired (the ego's version of God, of course). Now, all of this pain and anguish in our minds must be dealt with. And following the ego's advice on how to handle it, we project it out of our minds onto our bodies and the world in any number of ways. This ontological level of lack then is expressed on the bodily level as neediness, insecurity, cravings, addictions, and general feelings of never having enough--just some of the forms this content in our minds could take. We form special relationships with whatever we find externally that helps us feel better and takes some of the pain away. The need to hoard could certainly reflect the mind's insecurity about its fragile existence--fragile in the sense that it really rests on nothing, since our separation from God is illusory. Thus, hoarding and accumulating things would be one of the ways we attempt to compensate for our internal feelings of scarcity. In this sense, it would be no different from any other special relationship. Finally, it would not be antithetical to the Course to look at the more personal aspects that may also be involved in this disorder, and therefore working with a therapist could be quite helpful in uncovering this layer of causes. This would then free you to work at the deeper levels in your mind, releasing more of the interferences to your remembrance of the love in which you were created and forever remain."

    "text_input": "Q #1241: I have struggled most of my life with never being fully aware of God's Love for me. I understand and appreciate His Love for others, just not me. Perhaps experiences from my childhood are the cause, or just a very poor sense of self-worth. The reasons could be endless. I see the problems and the errors in my thinking; but that does not provide an answer or healing. I feel abandoned by God. His Love is just not quite within my reach. How do I heal this thought when I do not even see myself as worthy enough to be heard by God? When I read and study the Course, it feels as though my ego, my resistance is greater and stronger than God and He is waiting for me to heal this perception of myself and of Him first, and until then He will just remain silent. Could this be true? A: Resistance to changing our beliefs about ourselves is a major aspect of every student's spiritual process, as is feeling unworthy of love. Kenneth's book Ending Our Resistance to Love speaks to these issues directly. As is discussed in this book, being aware of your resistance is extremely helpful; but what you want to add to that is a decision not to justify your feelings of unworthiness. Although sometimes it is helpful to delve into the past to shed some light on this sense of unworthiness, the key to resolving the conflict is realizing that you are making a decision to hold on to that belief about yourself in the present. That is what you want to focus on. The ego loves to bring in the past because the past cannot be changed, which means we will be tempted to treat present conditions as limitations or handicaps we can do nothing about. Score one for the ego! Approaching your sense of unworthiness as a belief you are choosing in the present (even though you do not experience it that way) advances you to the next step of looking at it now from the perspective of purpose: if you are choosing that belief, it must be for a purpose, which means there is a payoff to it, something you want. Since it leaves you feeling completely separate from God and even hopeless, then the goal of continuing to believe in it is to maintain your existence as separate from God. But the guilt over that (unconscious, of course) would necessitate projecting responsibility for it, resulting in the feeling that God has abandoned you.",
    "output": "This is why Jesus emphasizes that feeling unworthy of God's Love is not humility or virtuous in any sense, unlike the view of many other spiritual paths (W-pI.61). Lesson 93 \"Light and joy and peace abide in me\" points out that our negative feelings are \"so firmly fixed that it is difficult to help you see that they are based on nothing\" (W-pI.93.2:1). They are meaningless beliefs and feelings because they rest on the false assumption that we truly are separate from God and hopelessly sinful and unworthy as a result. As part of the correction, Jesus assures us, \"Your sinlessness is guaranteed by God. Over and over this must be repeated, until it is accepted ... You are what God created or what you made. One Self is true, the other is not there. Try to experience the unity of your one Self\" (W-pI.93.6:1-2; 9:1-3). Realizing that our negativity is rooted in nothing real is extremely helpful, as we then would not be fighting against something we think is real. To answer your last question: From the Course's perspective, it could not be true that God is waiting for you to change your beliefs before He comes to you. That would be to give God human traits, and more importantly, it would imply that God somehow recognizes us as separate from Him, which is the exact opposite of the Atonement principle that states the separation never happened. The passages in the Course that speak of God that way are meant to help us with our fear of Him so that we would grow to trust Him as loving, comforting, and forgiving rather than as vindictive, judgmental, and unpredictable. This course is corrective of all our misperceptions about everything, and it must use language that meets us at our level of need, so that it can then raise us to higher levels, drawing us closer and closer to the perfect Oneness of Love, our true and eternal Identity. Since Love is perfect Oneness, it is just plain silly to think that there can be anything real that can oppose It, \"a power past omnipotence\" (T-29.VIII.6:2). What seems so powerful and destructive is nothing more than \"a frightened mouse that would attack the universe\" (T- 22.V.4:3); our seemingly monstrous ego has not even the power to stop the fall of a button (T- 18.IX.6:4), and if we think otherwise, it is only because we want it to be that way, not because it is in reality. Again, our feelings of helplessness and unworthiness are all based on nothing. That is what choosing Jesus as our teacher would help us to learn, thus freeing us to be the Self that God created.

    "text_input": "Q #1242: Recently someone close to me died of a drug overdose. I was with him at the time and was under the influence of drugs as well, and therefore I did not act accordingly to save him. How do I begin to deal with the tremendous guilt I have? If I chose the Holy Spirit's script at that point, could the form have changed; or would it rather be that my reaction would change: instead of attack and guilt, my reaction would have been forgiveness of myself?  Also, I had another death in my life a few years back that also brought up a lot of guilt. I tried to work through this, and then it did seem like I was in a place of peace for a while. Almost like nothing could bother me. Then I started to do some real stupid things. Was that my ego fighting back? How do I go about dealing with this guilt? I have been studying A Course in Miracles for over five years and thought I was making progress. Please comment.",
    "output": "The only thing we can say for sure is that when we choose the Holy Spirit's script, we would never attack ourselves or anyone else. Attack is impossible when we are identified with love. But what that means in terms of form we cannot know. We have to guard against the assumption that death is always a tragedy, and that it should be prevented if at all possible. We thus cannot automatically conclude that your friend's drug overdose was an attack on himself and/or anyone else. We just do not know that--it might have been, and it might not have been. Remember, too, that a major principle in A Course in Miracles is that death is always a choice made in one's mind (see T-19.IV-C.1:4; W-pI.152.1:4; M-12.5). Given that, it is possible that even if you were lucid and able to act, your friend may still have died--if that were his choice. There is no way we can know that. Another important point to keep in mind is that guilt is never justified, no matter what you have done. Undeniably, we all do very unloving things, and we all have very hateful thoughts. That is to be expected, considering that our existence was born out of our grossly selfish decision to separate ourselves from our home in God's Love. Jesus acknowledges that we can be hideously brutal when we choose the ego as our teacher; but he also makes it clear throughout his course that these choices are mistakes, not unforgivable sins deserving of condemnation, or even forgivable sins for which we must repent and do penance (a practice he says totally distorts the meaning of true forgiveness, turning it into a \"scourge\" and a \"curse\" [S-2.I.1:1-2]). Judgments of condemnation are just what the ego ordered! They affirm its existence and the supremacy of its thought system in our minds, concealing the other part that quietly calls to us to remember that sin and evil are possible only in an illusion, and that nothing can change the truth that we remain forever sinless (see for example, Lesson 93, \"Light and joy and peace abide in me.\"). The ego would never want us to question guilt, for guilt is its life's blood, so to speak: \"To the ego, the guiltless are guilty. Those who do not attack are its 'enemies' because, by not valuing its interpretation of salvation, they are in an excellent position to let it go\" (T-13.II.4:2- 3). This is why Jesus speaks about our attraction to guilt (T-19.IV-A.i), and that we hold it dear in our minds--as a friend, a protector, and even our home (T-19.IV-D.6). It is because of this that we often wind up thinking, \"Who would I be without my guilt?\" We cannot even imagine what it would be like to be without guilt and still recognize ourselves! That is the strength of our commitment to the ego thought system in our minds. And that could very well explain your seeming departure from a state of peace after working through some guilt relating to another death. We all just become fearful of being without guilt. Moreover, the ego usually kicks up its heels and retaliates for our \"disloyalty\" to it. Among the reasons that death plays such a central role in the ego's strategy is that it almost always brings up a lot of guilt and fear in people. But there is always a correction for this in the sane part of minds. You can also approach your current situation as a good opportunity to learn that relationships are always in the mind, not between two bodies. They always come down to the decision we make in our minds to take the ego or Jesus as our teacher. The healing of relationships, therefore, is not conditional on time and the state of bodies. In this sense, you can still work on your relationship with your friend even though he has died. The death of the body does not have to interfere with the relationship dynamics in your mind. A very difficult lesson!--and one the ego definitely does not want us to learn. The ego would have you learn instead that there is nothing you can do about your guilt, because your friend is dead. What all of this means is that you still have a split mind, and that you (and all of us) are going through a process of shifting from the ego to Jesus as your teacher. We go back and forth. The idea is not to judge yourself, or even analyze what happened. It is simply natural (un-natural, really) for us to become afraid of being at peace, and therefore we will do things that bring about the opposite state. By not making a big deal about it, you will loosen your hold on your ego, and consequently will be less inclined to resort to self-destructive behavior. Not judging yourself means you are forgiving yourself, and forgiveness is the only answer that leads to peace. #168 discusses some of the concerns you have raised--especially feelings of guilt over the death of a loved one. You might find it helpful to read our discussion there, and also in #7, where we talk about the whole issue of blame and self-hatred. Questions #246, #466, and #598 deal with issues of addiction."

    "text_input": "Q #1243: From what I understand, there is no world--it is an illusion of a thought of separation set up to maintain our egos. Does this mean that there are no special \"places\"? I'm thinking particularly of Ramana Maharshi and the mountain Arunachala. Ken has spoken about him as an enlightened being, and from what I've read and felt being there, it's absolutely true. I felt drawn to the place, like there was a presence behind the mountain itself. Could this be? Certainly Ramana Maharshi was drawn there. When I went I swear I could feel the presence thirty miles away. Is this part of the \"script\" or an idea of the \"ending\" that we're all destined to? In other words, can a \"place\" work on both a physical and spiritual level? A: Correct. If there is no world, then it follows that there are no special places. This is what we refer to as Level One in A Course in Miracles: statements of absolute truth, the contrast between truth and illusion. If we could accept this without reservation, we would know beyond all doubt that we are not our bodies; and then all but the perfect Oneness of God's Love would be gone. Since we are too fearful of full acceptance of that absolute truth, we allow only its reflection into our awareness, which is where Level Two discussions in the Course come in. On this level, Jesus contrasts the ego's thought system with the Holy Spirit's, and he teaches us that we are always choosing one or the other. This is the only content in our minds. The content with which we identify (the ego's or the Holy Spirit's) will govern how we perceive everything, without exception. In light of these two levels, if you experience inner peace in certain locations or circumstances (the form), it is solely because you first chose Jesus or the Holy Spirit as your teacher in your mind (the content). (For the purposes of this discussion, we will skip the issue of the false sense of peace that can come through denial.) Nothing outside you can either give you peace or take it away. Peace is within you as your inheritance as God's Son. This is at the heart of the message of A Course in Miracles. Learning that is the means of remembering that we never truly separated from God. Accordingly, what we want to learn is that external things that inspire us serve as reminders of what is always within us. The mistake we make--owing to the prodding of our body-obsessed ego--is to begin to worship the external place or thing as if it held special or spiritual qualities. The Course would have us learn that nothing in this world or the body is either holy or unholy. We can make it holy, so to speak, by using it or relating to it as a means of fulfilling our purpose of forgiveness. As we choose Jesus as our teacher more and more, we will be attracted more and more to the love and peace within us; and we will become less inclined to attribute our internal state of peace or lack of it to external conditions.",

    "text_input": "Q #1244: Could you comment on the issue of crucifixion as it is seen in A Course in Miracles. Do you think that Jesus invited his \"persecutors\" to crucify him in order to prove that the body isn't real at all (epitomized by the rising of Christ)? If I read the Course correctly, it places more emphasis on the rising and surmounting of the image of death rather than the crucifixion itself (which we do on a daily basis). So what does the crucifixion mean? Is it not also a symbol for how the world is structured, and did Jesus pick the crucifixion method because of that? Why did Jesus die that way?--to make his point of rising beyond the body?",
    "output": "It is very difficult to talk about the crucifixion because we know so little about it. The gospels have been proven to be notoriously unreliable, as many scripture scholars have shown. In A Course in Miracles, Jesus uses crucifixion as a symbol for the ego thought system, and therefore we should view his crucifixion as a symbol, primarily of the truth that the ego has no power over the Love of God. Accordingly, resurrection, is defined in the Course as awakening from the dream of death, which means that our dream of separation has had no effect on reality. (See \"What Is the Resurrection?\" in the manual for teachers [M-28].) In this sense, it can be said that the resurrection occurred before the crucifixion, resurrection having nothing to do with the body. Two important sections in the text focus explicitly on Jesus' teachings about crucifixion: \"Atonement without Sacrifice\" (T-3.I), and \"The Message of the Crucifixion\" (T-6.I). And in several of his works, Kenneth has commented extensively on the differences between biblical views and those in A Course in Miracles. See, for example, The Message of A Course in Miracles, Vol. One, Chapters 6 and 7; A Course in Miracles and Christianity: A Dialogue; A Talk Given on A Course in Miracles: An Introduction, Chapter 5. Other students have asked about the Course's understanding of the crucifixion, and you may wish to look at our discussion of those Questions as well: #220, #505, and #510."

You are free, however, to decide when you want to learn it. And as you accept it, it is already learned\" (M-2.3:6-8).",
    "output": "The reference here is to the text's Introduction where Jesus makes the same point: \"This is a course in miracles. It is a required course. Only the time you take it is voluntary. Free will does not mean that you can establish the curriculum. It means only that you can elect what you want to take at a given time\" (T-in.1:1-5; italics omitted). As an example, college students have nothing to say about the courses listed in the school catalog, but they are free to pick which courses they will take and when--at least with regard to electives. Our situation is similar. Our decision maker has already established the curriculum of our lives, but our choice now lies with which teacher we will choose to re-experience this script: the ego or the Holy Spirit. Therefore, when we accept the curriculum, \"it is already learned\"--we simply accept the learning that is there."

    "text_input": "Q #1246: In answer to #265 you have written; \"... it is important for students of the Course not to confuse the voice Helen Schucman heard and identified as Jesus' with the Jesus of traditional Christianity, nor to associate it with any particular image in form. The Course uses the term Jesus and the Holy Spirit as symbols reflecting the part of the mind of the Sonship that holds the memory of God. They are not real persons ... \" There seem to be two different \"realities\" here; namely the ultimate reality (which is Love), and the apparent historical reality (which though illusory, would seem to have some validity for us, when perceived correctly). Is there any reason why we should (or should not) regard the \"voice\" that Helen identified as Jesus, and which dictated A Course in Miracles to her, as the voice of the historical Jesus? If we should not regard this voice as the voice of the historical Jesus, then what is the relationship between this voice and the historical Jesus?",
    "output": "As much as we would like it to be, this is not a simple matter of \"is he or isn't he?.\" That is because of the Course's uncompromising view of reality as non-dualistic: \"a Oneness joined as One,\" which cannot be understood by us in our separated state (T-25.I.7:1). This non-dualism is expressed in the Course's definition of Heaven, as \"an awareness of perfect Oneness, and the knowledge that there is nothing else; nothing outside this Oneness, and nothing else within\" (T- 18.VI.1:6). Non-dualism means that both spirit and matter, mind and body cannot be real. That would be dualism. Thus, all multiplicity is illusory, as well as time and space. Statements expressing this contrast between reality and illusion are what we call Level One of the Course's presentation. The issue then is how to conceptualize and talk about what certainly appears to be real to us, but is not. The initial stage of communication would be to use our language and concepts about individual persons living in a physical universe, and then teach us how to interpret our experiences here differently. This is Level Two of the Course's presentation, the part that contrasts wrong-minded and right-minded perception. This would eventually lead to our recognizing that our specifics-oriented perception is seriously distorted, and that everything we perceive is really a symbol--either of our mind's choice to identify with the ego thought system of separation or the Holy Spirit's correction of that, the thought system of forgiveness. This approach of A Course in Miracles is made especially explicit in Lesson 184, \"The Name of God is my inheritance.\" and also in Jesus' injunction that we not confuse symbol and source (T- 19.IV-C.11:2), to cite just two references. Viewing everything as symbolic, including ourselves, enables us to function purposefully in the world while we still think it real, and at the same time be oriented toward regaining awareness of our true Identity that lies beyond all symbols, as beautifully explained in three sections in the text: \"Beyond the Body\" (T-18.VI); \"Beyond All Symbols\" (T-27.III), and \"Beyond All Idols\" (T-30.III). Although this is not usually in our awareness--but is what the exercises in the workbook help bring into our awareness--we are always choosing either to deny the truth or to ask for help to remove the interferences we are making to our awareness of truth. When we choose to undo these interferences, we allow it to happen gradually, which means we do not suddenly let go of our identity as individual persons and accept our identity as spirit without reservations. We are too fearful of doing that; consequently, we let love in in stages or increments, according to what our fear will allow us to tolerate. Jesus tells us that the very origin of the body is our mind's belief in limited love; \"it was made to limit the unlimited\" (T-18.VIII.1:3). Therefore, to the extent that we believe our bodily identity is our real identity, we will continue to perceive love in those terms. Love is abstract and formless, but as long as we think we are individuals, we will perceive love as limited, or as form in some way. This is not wrong. It is an important first step that would lead to delay in one's progress if skipped, for it gets us on the right ladder with the right teacher. But it is also important to realize that relating to Jesus as a person is a stage in our spiritual journey. Jesus reflects the formless Love of God, but is not identical with that Love. (The passage we quoted from the clarification of terms in the question you cited, #265, is relevant here.) Thus, if my identity as an individual symbolizes my mind's belief in a real existence outside God and Heaven, and then my mind decides to undo that mistaken belief and accept the truth, the truth will be symbolized in a way that is meaningful and understandable by my mind. If I think of myself as an individual, then I need love to be present to me in the form of an individual, otherwise I would not recognize it or be able to relate to it. The Jesus of the Course speaks to us in a personal way, and he encourages us to accept him into our lives as we would an older, wiser brother who knows what is best for us. And we ought to do that. In fact, he tells us: \"If it helps you, think of me holding your hand and leading you. And I assure you this will be no idle fantasy\" (W-pI.70.9:3-4). Yet, although he is presented in this way, speaking to us as individuals, he also makes it clear that we are involved in a process of climbing up the ladder that separation led us down (T- 28.III.1:2). The top of the ladder is the transcendence of individuality, because at that stage, we no longer value existence that keeps us separate from God and from each other; we have realized that that was the source of all our pain and conflict. We realize that there really is no self that is separate from other selves and from God, and we would have become identified with love, no longer relating to it as one specific form to another. We would have become one with the love that inspired the Course, no longer needing its specific form. This is the return to the oneness of our Self as God's one Son, Christ: \"Identify with love, and you are safe. Identify with love, and you are home. Identify with love, and find your Self\" (W-pII.5:6-8). The principle of the Course's non-dualism and the Course's aim of restoring to our awareness our oneness with the formless Love of God--\"a Oneness joined as One\" (T-25.I.7:1)--from which we never truly separated, must be taken into account when one thinks about the nature and origin of the voice Helen heard. A voice is specific; an historical person is specific. Therefore, to say without qualification that the voice she heard was the voice of the historical Jesus is to distort and severely dilute the profound and radical message of A Course in Miracles. Moreover, in light of biblical scholarship, one must draw a distinction between the historical Jesus and the biblical accounts of his life and message. The conclusions drawn by a significant number of scholars is that these accounts are not accurate, and therefore we actually know very little about the historical figure. In the Course, Jesus corrects a great many New Testament statements and teachings attributed to him, and so it is safe to say that the Jesus of the Course is not the New Testament version of him. His message in the Course differs decidedly from that presented in the Bible. See, for example, \"Atonement without Sacrifice\" (T-3.I), and \"The Message of the Crucifixion\" (T-6.I), where he tells us what his message really is. There are many more. Other Questions address this as well: #473ii and #505, for example. What Helen \"heard,\" therefore, was a reflection of the formless Love of Heaven in a form that part of the Sonship could relate to and recognize as loving. Many other forms are possible (M- 1.4:1-2). The love that inspired the Course is all that is truly healing, and eventually identifying with that love is the aim of our work with it. The form known as A Course in Miracles is merely a learning aide that we can use, if we are comfortable with it, to help us reach the point where we realize that the love that inspired this course is all that is real in our own minds. Jesus reflects that to us until we can accept it as our own identity: \"And thus you joined with me, so what I am are you as well\" (W-pII.14.2:3). This would be the acceptance of the Atonement, the undoing of our belief that separation from God is possible and has truly happened. For further study, we recommend Chapter 17, \"The Reality of Jesus,\" in Absence from Felicity, and Chapter 6, \"The Savior--Jesus,\" in All Are Called, Vol. One of The Message of A Course in Miracles."

    "text_input": "Q #1247: I have become aware that the helpful yet needy relationship I have been developing with Jesus as teacher, friend, guide, elder brother, comforter is changing to something that I would like to try to describe. My question is whether this is a normal part of the process of learning and growing toward the goal(s) of A Course in Miracles. Rather than representing solely the above roles, I now seem to grasp that Jesus is a symbol that is not at all specific or limited. I sense that the content of the right mind is really a reflection of what I denied when the so-called dream of separation began, and like its source, the abstract content of the right mind merely is. Therefore, I can better understand that Jesus or the Holy Spirit really do nothing. Somehow, in some way that I do not understand, my mind opens a little and allows or accepts some experience of what we call truth, love, peace, Atonement, and it is that experience (the miracle) that corrects and cancels out my errors in perception if I sincerely desire to let them go. What I am recognizing is that I am the one doing all the work; that my progress really is up to me, and I am more aware of the meaning of \"a little willingness\" to take responsibility when choosing my ego. Somewhere in your writings or audio/video publications there is something about eventually growing up in our dependent relationship with our elder brother, Jesus. What do you make of this seeming change in my needy relationship with Jesus? I'm not just trying to kick him out again, am I? A: What you describe seems to be the natural transition that should take place. The spiritual path of A Course in Miracles is a journey leading us back to the oneness of perfect Love that we believe we shattered by desiring our own special individualized existence. Therefore, any semblance of separation must eventually disappear in our minds if we are to regain our true Identity as Christ and return home to God. Relating to Jesus as an older, wiser brother is a wonderful starting point on our journey. He even asks us to relate to him that way, and to learn how to trust him unconditionally, acknowledging that he knows what is in our best interests and we do not. At that level we still see ourselves as separate from him, and very much dependent on him. That is as it should be, but it is just the beginning stage of the relationship, and he does not want us to remain at that level of spiritual childhood. Thus, at one point he says, \"I will teach with you and live with you if you will think with me, but my goal will always be to absolve you finally from the need for a teacher\" (T-4.I.6:3). He wants us to become what he is, something he expresses early in the text: \"There is nothing about me",
    "output": "that you cannot attain. I have nothing that does not come from God. The difference between us now is that I have nothing else. This leaves me in a state which is only potential in you ... I am in [no] way separate or different from you except in time, and time does not really exist\" (T- 1.II.3:5-6,10-13; 4:1). And near the end of the workbook he speaks very movingly of our oneness with him: \"Yet in the final days of this one year we gave to God together, you and I, we found a single purpose that we shared. And thus you joined with me, so what I am are you as well\" (W-pII.14.2:2-3). A parallel to this is found in his description of prayer as a ladder (see The Song of Prayer S-I,II). The bottom rungs of the ladder are marked by our pleas for help with our needs and problems. But as we find ourselves attracted to the loving Source of the answers, our perception of what we think we need changes. Now we grow increasingly vigilant for what stands in the way of our experiencing that love all the time, with all of our seeming problems fading in significance. We recognize that our only need is to awaken from the dream of separation, \"the only real need to be fulfilled in time\" (T-13.VII.16:6; see also T-13.VII.14:2-3; T-24.V.6:6). We should be careful, though, not to skip steps and pretend that we are on the higher rungs of the spiritual ladder when we are not. It is humbling indeed to be told that we are in the infancy stage of salvation (T- 19.IV-C.9,10), but that humility is required if we are going to hear the answer to our call for help. Spiritual maturity on the Course's path involves the recognition at some point that Jesus is really a symbol of the contents in our right mind that we have split off. Because of this dissociation, our only access to our right minds usually is to first relate to Jesus as a person like us, a loving brother devoted to teaching and helping us. As we allow him to show us that we have been wrong about everything--especially about who we think we are--we begin to realize that everything is going on only in our minds, which means that we begin to relate to everything as symbols of the choice we have made in our minds to identify with separation as reality or with oneness as reality. Our experience of both Jesus and ourselves will then change. We must gradually move beyond the perception of separate bodies relating to one another, or we will remain asleep and dreaming, living as aliens in a world that is not our home. All of this is pulled together in Kenneth's Lighthouse article, \"Our Equality with Jesus: A Child, a Man, and Then a Spirit\" (Dec. 2004). Another helpful resource is our audio set, \"Jesus-- Symbol and Reality,\" in which Kenneth focuses on the growth from spiritual childhood to spiritual maturity. Chapter 17 in Absence from Felicity also presents this spectrum in the context of Helen Schucman's experience of Jesus."

Since words are merely symbols twice removed and several words can symbolize the same idea (Jesus/Holy Spirit or God/Perfect Love/Oneness), could we just as easily say our guilt remains buried in the \"subconscious mind\" instead of the \"unconscious mind\"? A: The term subconscious does not appear in A Course in Miracles; but the term unconscious is used to describe the mind's intentional banishing of something from awareness. The emphasis is on the mind's decision not to deal with what it has judged fearful, or simply what it wants",

For example, Jesus explains in Lesson 136 that we \"set up a series of defenses to reduce the threat that has been judged real,\" and then after we do this, we deliberately forget we did it: \"your plan requires that you must forget you made it ... \" (W-pI.136.4:1,3).

A Course in Miracles seems to be a different kind of non- dualism. I wonder if you have an idea of how this differs from other non-dualistic philosophies. I also have in my study substituted Guru-Spirit for Holy Spirit. Does the Course allow for such an exchange of terms?",
    "output": "A Course in Miracles is a strict non-dualism, which means that God alone is real. Nothing finite, limited, or imperfect is real, which also means that nothing lacking the perfect Love of God is real--sin, for example, cannot be real. This type of radical monism is also found in the highest teachings of the Vedanta school of Hinduism, where all multiplicity and finitude is regarded as illusory. Brahman, the Ultimate Reality, is the only true reality. This absolute non- dualism differs from the mitigated forms of non-dualism, which loosely fall into the category of pantheism (pan-theos, meaning all things are God). In pantheistic systems, diversity is real, but only as parts of one Divine Being, not in the form of distinct beings with their own existence. There are examples of this in the West, but it is more prevalent in Eastern philosophies. Generally speaking, in the devotional traditions (Bhakti) of the East, the world and persons are real, but not as independent beings. They are real only as modes of the Divine Reality, in whom their ultimate reality is rooted. The implications of these views of what constitutes reality are profound, and the exploration of that is the subject of Kenneth's book, Love Does Not Condemn: The World, the Flesh, and the Devil According to Platonism, Christianity, Gnosticism, and A Course in Miracles. With regard to substituting Guru-Spirit for Holy Spirit, if that works for you, then continue with it. The form is not what is important, only the content--of an inner teacher."

    "output": "It is possible that there is a connection. However, it may not be the lesson itself that is the cause, but the decision your mind has made to take what the lesson says seriously. And that itself could be a result of all the work you have already done in your mind up to this point. Without realizing it consciously, you could have become more fearful of what A Course in Miracles really means, in terms of your identity and your life. This fear could then be expressed physically or psychologically--sleep difficulties are just one form this fear could take. Most students go through something like this--it is inevitable. Our whole approach to relationships, as well as everything else about our lives would have to change if we integrate the Course; and therefore we would experience the Course as tremendously threatening, even though we are strongly attracted to it and have chosen it as our spiritual path. While it is natural to experience some agitation and anxiety when practicing the lessons, it is also important not to get overly serious about your process, and above all, not to force yourself to change in any way. Gentleness and patience should always guide your practice. If you experience anything else, then more than likely your ego has crept in and is trying to take over as your teacher. Simply slow down a little, and reassure yourself that when you are ready, you will take the next step, and it doesn't matter when that is. Time is irrelevant to Jesus and the Holy Spirit. If behavioral difficulties persist, then sometimes the most loving thing you can do for yourself (which is a way of practicing the Course) is to get some external help."

    "text_input": "Q #1251: I am having difficulty understanding how my interactions with other people who are going through the same process of learning that their thoughts are creating reality are able to coexist and not interfere with one another. If I believe and understand that reality is a manifestation of thought, does this not have an effect on other people? What if I have thoughts about another person?--how can my reality possibly make our two realities come together? If the situation has been decided by all involved beforehand, then I feel as though I am in a grand illusion that is no longer a good space to be in. It would be nice to get some validation that I'm not a puppet on someone's string. I am giving 100% to learning how to relearn that the world, and this email for that matter, is only a thought and nothing more. I got the concept that we are all the same energy, but I don't understand it when it relates to individuality. A: No, you are not a \"puppet on someone's string\"; and A Course in Miracles' theory of time does not entail predestination. In fact, one of the major objectives of Jesus' teaching is to have us realize that our decision to choose the ego or him as our teacher determines what our experience will be at every instant. But it would not be entirely accurate to say that we therefore \"create our reality.\"",
    "output": "If I choose the ego as my teacher, then my thoughts will emanate from the thought system of separation, and whatever is going on externally will be interpreted by me (my decision maker) accordingly. The ego thought system will be a kind of template, in terms of which my internal experience of the external will be \"created.\" When I interact with you, for instance, my ego needs will determine how I experience you. I do not create your reality; I \"create\" my perception of you based on my prior choice to listen to the ego rather than Jesus or the Holy Spirit. And my perception of you may not even square with the objective reality, because my ego needs could result in distorted perception--which is frequently the case. It is next to impossible for us to jump from our experience of ourselves as physical/psychological individuals to an experience of ourselves as minds not bound by time or space. Even the intellectual understanding of mind is not easy for us, as you have found. One of the reasons for this difficulty is that we are far more invested in the ego thought system than we realize, and since the core of the ego's strategy is to keep us mindless, attempting to perceive a realm beyond the body and specifics (the realm of mindlessness) would seem quite unnatural and frustrating to us, and almost impossible to attain. We would be fighting against ourselves to perceive everything as mind when, at the same time, we are upholding a decision to deny our identity as mind. Therefore, what might help ease the pressure and confusion you are experiencing is to approach this issue from a different direction: shifting your focus to the purpose or the way you are using the world, your body, and your relationships, rather than trying so hard to relate to the world and everyone as thought. It is true that there is only mind and thoughts in the mind; but your experience of that will come more naturally if you focus first on becoming comfortable with recognizing the purpose in your mind that is motivating the way you relate and interact in the world. The practice of this would lead you eventually to see beyond the appearances of individuality to the decision-making mind that is \"in charge.\" Then you would see that no one is under anyone else's control, unless that kind of experience is wanted; but then that choice could be changed at any instant. For example, as long as we identify with the ego's thought system of separation, it is a given that we will relate to each other in the context of specialness, which means we will judge some people as not deserving of our love, compassion, and forgiveness--even ourselves at times. Specialness and exclusion go hand in hand. We can thus learn to recognize how we use people to keep ourselves in the particular state of specialness we desire--to get what we want. Even further, the roots of specialness are hidden in the mind's compulsion to see and judge differences; and so we can learn to recognize that dimension in our relationships as well. As we continue this process of looking and observing, we will be shifting our attention more and more away from form to the content in our minds. And eventually we will relate to ourselves and everyone else primarily on that level, while at the same time we will be functioning normally in our day-to-day activities (form). Thus, when we realize how we make differences important, and then seek to correct that (we change teachers in our mind), our perception will shift to the interests we all share--that we all are suffering tremendous anguish and guilt over believing we selfishly separated from our Source, and that we all are longing to go back home to Heaven. As that becomes our abiding perception, then our investment in individuality will begin to weaken, without our even working on that directly. The transition to the experience of everything as mind, thus, would be more natural, and certainly more gentle than trying to pressure ourselves to get beyond the body and form entirely. This is why Jesus reminds us often that we are involved in a process of undoing what we have made in error. We start where we are--with what we are most familiar with. Near the end of the text, Jesus tells us, \"Salvation does not ask that you behold the spirit and perceive the body not. It merely asks that this should be your choice\" (T-31.VI.3:1-2). Thus, our willingness to change from the ego's purpose to the Holy Spirit's purpose for the world and the body is what will facilitate the gentle transition to true perception, and to the vision we share with Jesus."

    "text_input": "Q #1252: If God is not aware of our illusion of separation, how did He know to send the Holy Spirit to help us? One thought that comes to me is that the Holy Spirit is a construct of, (or is?) our Christ Mind and so was in our mind, and remains so, even when we imagine that we are separate. Therefore, are Jesus, and the Christ Mind, and the Holy Spirit and the \"Son of God\" all the same? Is the idea of Trinity really a twosome (God and his Creation meaning all of the above terms?) I would be so grateful for your input. A: We have already answered your first question, and refer you to Questions #459 and #616 for our response. The Holy Spirit, as presented in A Course in Miracles is not considered a construct",
    "output": "of our Christ Mind. He symbolizes for us the memory of our true Self that resides in the sane part of our post-separation mind--an illusory split mind, of course, as the separation never truly happened. You might say that the Holy Spirit is in the Mind of God, not the Christ Mind, insofar as Jesus tells us that when the separation is completely undone, the Holy Spirit will no longer take form--as the Voice for God--but will return to the eternal formlessness of God (C-6.5:8). Another discussion of this with additional references may be found in Question #1159. Questions #625 and #626 pertain to your queries about the nature of God and Jesus. What always helps when trying to piece together a theology is to remember that we are dealing with symbols. Reality is pure oneness, which is incomprehensible to us as long as we experience ourselves as individuals consciously thinking about issues. This is the main point of Jesus' discussion in the first section of Chapter 25 (T-25.I.5-7). He uses language and concepts that we can understand, but his purpose is to lead us beyond that level to the experience of God's Love, which transcends all form and symbol. Jesus, as we describe in #626 above, reflects or symbolizes God's Love in a form we can relate to, and in this sense he is not the Christ Mind. He is the Son of God, the same as we are in our separated state. In emphasizing our equality with him on this level, he corrects the biblical view that he alone is God's Son, and we the adopted sons of God. The term Son of God is also used in the Course to refer to Christ, our true Self, the Second Person of the Trinity. Thus, the term is used for our true Self, Christ, as part of the Oneness of God's Being, and it is also used for the post-separation self, or the decision maker that can choose to awaken from the dream of separation from God."

    "text_input": "Q #1253: A Course in Miracles speaks often of how we have \"made up our world.\" It uses the word projection, stating that it is mind that does the seeming deed. But I am confused as to how I make up my world. How did/do I do it?",
    "output": "It is important first to understand that when the Course says we have made up the world, it is not referring to the self we each believe we are, with a specific body and brain and personality and name. These selves, with which we are identified, are only aspects of the world that we have made up. That is, they are effects and not causes. Jesus is only ever addressing us as mind, and it is the mind that has made this all up, as you have noted. The mind exists outside of time and space, that is, outside this world in which we seem to experience ourselves. And more accurately, it can be said that the world of time and space exists, as an illusion, within the mind. A useful analogy to help grasp this is to think of our dreams at night. While we are asleep, we typically think we are one of the figures we are dreaming about, usually the same self we are identified with when we are awake. But as we reflect upon a dream after awakening, we do not attribute any causal power to the figure in the dream with which we identified, even though it may have seemed as if it had some control over events while we were still asleep. We know the dream and all the figures are merely symbols, results of our mind's imaginings. Jesus tells us in \"The Basis of the Dream\" that the same mind that makes up and projects the world of our night dreams is also dreaming the world we experience when we believe we are awake (T-18.II.5:8- 14). We experience ourselves as separate minds, but we are in fact part of the one mind, both the single ego mind that is dreaming the world we experience as outside ourselves, and the one Mind that knows nothing of illusion. Although the how of this whole process of projecting a world is interesting, the more important question from the Course's perspective is why do we do it. As Jesus observes later in the same section, \"It is not strange that dreams can make a world that is unreal. It is the wish to make it that is incredible\" (T-18.II.8:2-3). And the wish comes from the insane desire to be something other than Who we are as God has created us, and the guilt that follows from that desire, which we seek to project and see outside ourselves. Earlier in the text, Jesus observes that \"the world you see is the delusional system of those made mad by guilt\" (T- 13.in.2:2). And he means that quite literally! The world is nothing more than our own guilt as the one sleeping Son projected outward, identical in process to the nightmares we may experience while we sleep at night, which come from what we experience as our own personal internalized guilt. But they are all the same, and they are insane, for we are doing nothing to undo the guilt within our minds but rather are denying its source, preferring to see the guilt \"outside\" rather than within. Each seemingly separate fragment of mind, believing it is separate, does not have the power to change the one ego mind's dream in any meaningful way. But it does have the power to learn to look at the dream differently, until eventually it gives no power to the dream and awakens from it. It is in this sense that we can say that we are each completely responsible for the world we see and experience. We each make up our own psychological world, based on our interpretation of what we seem to be experiencing. It is still the mind outside of time and space that is interpreting the experience, but we seem to have a choice about how we will look at what seems to be happening around us and to us and what we ourselves as figures in the dream are doing. And the only real choice is to which teacher in our minds we turn to help us interpret our experiences-- the ego or the Holy Spirit. This is the more practical level on which the Course is written. For knowing the metaphysical basis of our world helps us begin to question our ego interpretations of events, which up until now we were certain were true. And we will begin to see that, depending on to which teacher we turn to interpret what seems to be happening, we will have diametrically opposite experiences. For, as Jesus notes near the end of the workbook (in a lesson that begins by describing the process we've been discussing by which the mind makes a world), \"From insane wishes comes an insane world. From judgment comes a world condemned. And from forgiving thoughts a gentle world comes forth, with mercy for the holy Son of God, to offer him a kindly home where he can rest a while before he journeys on, and help his brothers walk ahead with him, and find the way to Heaven and to God\" (W-pII.325.1:4-6)."

Having been a spiritual student for several years, I know that the body is just an illusion and that we are in control of our thoughts. But I feel I will never achieve peace. Sometimes I feel so angry and depressed that I wonder, why bother? I feel very desperate for help!",
    "output": "The state you describe--knowing that ultimately our own thoughts determine our experience but still at times finding ourselves mired in depression and anger--is undoubtedly very familiar to many spiritual students. Ironically, the knowledge that we do not have to be miserable often heightens our awareness of just how miserable we are. In addition, it is likely that the idea of beginning the workbook is extremely threatening to your ego. As the Course says, \"The ego will attack your motives as soon as they become clearly out of accord with its perception of you. This is when it will shift abruptly from suspiciousness to viciousness, since its uncertainty is increased\" (T-9.VII.4:6-7). So perhaps you can take some comfort in the fact that yours is a common reaction to trying to achieve spiritual growth. It is not a symptom of weakness or a sign of failure on your part. If you are feeling desperate for help, seek that help in whatever form you think would be most effective for you right now. For example, do not hesitate to get medical or psychological assistance if that could alleviate your health concerns and depression. It is true that real healing comes exclusively from the miracle, or change of perception that occurs in the mind, and that it is the only thing that can lead us to lasting inner peace. But as long as we retain any guilt or identification with ourselves as the separated, physical beings we seem to be, we do not want to deny ourselves physical or psychological comfort. While Jesus does label attempts to solve problems where they are not--i.e., in the world--as magic, nowhere does he say not to do this. In fact, he tells us that to deny the existence of the world or the body is \"a particularly unworthy form of denial\" (T-2.IV.3:11). (See also T-2.IV.4-5.) Emotional ups and downs, and endless concerns and pains, are inevitable for bodies. Indeed, we dreamed up this world precisely to be in a constant struggle that obliterates God's Love from our mind. So we cannot expect our issues to subside easily. Feeling guilty or frustrated that we still have them is not a helpful or kind thing to do to ourselves. What is helpful is to realize that our pains are the very curriculum that the Holy Spirit can use to teach us that we are not the victim of the world we see (W-pI.57.1:1). For that to happen, we need to ask Him to hold our hand and look at our pain with us, without judgment. He will teach us that our troubles merely indicate that our intellectual understanding of the illusory nature of the world and the body are still overshadowed by our fear. And fear calls for love and understanding, not punishment. This, then, is the answer to why it is worth continuing on the spiritual path, even when it feels as though we are not getting anywhere. By realizing that the Holy Spirit's non-judgmental Love is in our mind--right alongside our fear --we discover that our insanity has no effect on God's Love. In this way, our fear and pain gradually lessen and begin to lose the power they seemed to have over us. They may not disappear for quite some time, but they slowly cease to be a big deal. Eventually, every time we feel pain we can simply look at it and say, \"There it goes again. So what else is new?\" Until we reach that point, when we catch ourselves thinking that our pain is a miserable ending point rather than a silly, temporary roadblock, we can remember Jesus' loving advice: \"The ego always marches to defeat, because it thinks that triumph over you is possible. And God thinks otherwise\" (T-23.I.2:6-7)."

    "text_input": "Q #1257: I am very frustrated with my practice of A Course in Miracles because I feel that all that I want is specific guidance. I beg, beg, and beg for specific guidance but none comes. I am so sick and tired of people saying to just follow the Holy Spirit's directions, because I try to and I don't hear anything. Unlike many others, I am willing to accept that \"I don't know\" as Jesus says, but I don't hear an alternative often for what I think that I do know. I am willing to be the most obedient student of Jesus, but how can I be obedient if I don't hear any answers?",
    "output": "To at least reassure you that you are not alone in this, we quote Jesus' statement that \"very few can hear God's Voice at all\" (M-12.3:3). Second, there are many different ways of \"hearing\" the Holy Spirit--His guidance can come through an idea, a loving thought, a feeling, a dream, something you read or that someone else says or does, and so on. It is not limited to literal words or instructions. The Holy Spirit, though, represents the content in your right mind, which essentially is the correction of the content in your wrong mind. That is what the Holy Spirit is about and speaks for. We are the ones who give the form to the content, meaning that, more often than not, we define the nature of the communication according to what we think we need. That is a severe limitation, but we do it only because of the tremendous fear we have of accepting pure love as our only identity. The reflection of pure love is in our right mind, and that is the content of any answer the Holy Spirit would give, because if we could accept that love, all our needs would vanish--we would have everything and want for nothing, regardless of the circumstances in our lives. \"Can this be traded for a bit of trifling advice about a problem of an instant's duration?\" Jesus pleads in his discussion of the nature of prayer (S-1.I.4:6). Yet, he also recognizes that we are not yet on that level, and so goes on to speak about prayer as a ladder (S-1.II). Importantly, he never says it is wrong or harmful to ask for specifics; he is just helping us recognize that our needs are coming from a false identity we have accepted in place of the one conferred by our Creator, and that by continuing to ask for specifics without ever addressing our real and only need, we are ensuring that we will never have true and lasting peace. Finally, what can simplify this for you is to see the issue not so much as, \"Why don't I hear the Holy Spirit's Voice?\" but as, \"Why don't I do what He tells me, which is to forgive.\" Forgiveness is our only function; and fulfilling that function is what will bring us the peace and happiness we seek. Lessons 121 and 122 in the workbook are wonderful reminders of this (W- pI.121,122). You might find it helpful to look at Questions #215, #538, and #555, which elaborate on the issues discussed here."

    "text_input": "Q #1258: I am continually confronted by my lack of faith in Jesus, God/Higher Power to actually create change in my mind. I want desperately to believe that I can have joy and peace while living in this world, in this lifetime, but it continually eludes me. And then I fear that my lack of faith is what is creating my lack of well-being (e.g., physical, financial) in many areas of my life. The lack of \"evidence\" of well-being in my experience makes sustained faith impossible for me. It appears that the small willingness necessary for a change in perception is not really enough to create the miracle for me. I spend so much time in observation of my thoughts and in recognition of my misperceptions. I give those mistakes to Jesus, and nothing changes in my experience or in my mind. Could it be that the Course was not meant to be applicable to everyone? A: There are very few students who have not held out some hope that their diligent work with A Course in Miracles would somehow lead to the betterment of their situation in the world. It is hard not to want physical, financial, and other levels of well being, and the Course never asks us to give that up or feel that it is wrong to pursue it. It is just telling us that we will never rid ourselves of the true cause of our unhappiness and frustration that way, because the real problem lies in our mind's choice to project guilt instead of looking at it without judgment. We know all too well that however secure we may feel in terms of external conditions, that security is always precarious--our world today makes that abundantly clear. Therefore, Jesus cautions us, \"Seek not escape from problems here. The world was made that problems could not be escaped\" (T- 31.IV.2:5-6). Part of us believes that, and part of us doesn't. Thus our conflicted state of mind. Our investment in believing the body is our reality amounts to an addiction, and our fear of bodily impoverishment and inadequacy is that of an addict's fear of being without his fix. Jesus explains to us that the source of this investment is the body's role in protecting us from the devastation we believe is in our minds because we accuse ourselves of having thrown away our wholeness, in our selfish demand for individual existence. \"The ego believes that mind is dangerous, and that to make mindless is to heal\" (T-8.IX.6:3). As long as we identify with the ego, we will desperately need the body; and even more important, we will need to be successful in the body so that we will never have to go back to the disturbing chaos in our minds. That is the reason we panic when things are not going well. In view of this, we cannot long sustain the thought that we are as God created us, for that means we are not bodies. But the body, once again, with all its needs and problems, is what protects us from what we fear to face in our minds; so we are caught--wanting to believe what the Course says, yet fearing to go there. Therefore, we find a way to compromise between our devotion to the Course and our devotion to achieving security and stability in the world. This ego strategy then leaves us desolate and despairing when things don't work out the way we think they should, and then we conclude that our faith is wanting; or the Holy Spirit has turned a deaf ear to our pleas; or our sinfulness is just too great, or we haven't sacrificed enough, etc. That is exactly where the ego wants us to end up--no longer in touch with the truth about ourselves, the world, Jesus, this course, the Holy Spirit, and God, blaming something or someone for our miserable state.",
    "output": "Fear is the problem, not a lack of faith or belief. Therefore, just try to be gentle and patient, as you would with anyone you encounter who is frightened. Accept where you are in your process, and ask Jesus to help you look at the real source of your crisis. It is only our fear that makes the Course seem beyond our capability, because as we well know, fear can distort perception and cause us to grasp for anything that promises immediate relief. This course is simply asking us to accept the truth and deny what is false. Again, our fear causes us to complicate this, because fear impels us to erect defenses against it, and then we get lost in the defenses. In the face of the temptation to believe the Course is beyond you, remember Jesus' many assurances, one comforting example being: \"I would not ask you to do things you cannot do, and it is impossible that I could do things you cannot do. Given this, and given this quite literally, nothing can prevent you from doing exactly what I ask, and everything argues for your doing it. I give you no limits because God lays none upon you\" (T-8.IX.8:2-4)."

    "output": "Expressed in other terms, bringing a problem to the love of Jesus is to look at your problem from the perspective of your right mind. While we have split off the right mind from our awareness, it is still there. We just need to choose against the ego (the wrong mind) more and more, and then we will gradually regain awareness of our right mind. As the process continues, you would come to experience this as a loving, non-judgment presence, though whether you call it Jesus or not is unimportant. In your right mind you know that separation is not real, and so you do not project, judge, or take anything that goes on in the world seriously. Attracted more to forgiveness and the undoing of thoughts of separation, you would automatically see your problem in a different light now. You would want to see the sameness between yourself and everyone else and minimize the differences, without ignoring them. You would realize that your right mind represents your true Self, and you would eventually feel more at home there than in the ego's home (your wrong mind) of specialness, judgment, conflict, and death. You would therefore approach the problems that arise in your life in a very different way, more in line with your purpose of asking for help to remove all interferences to your awareness of love's presence.

Related closely to this: is A Course in Miracles not a pointless journey?",
    "output": "As a self-contained curriculum, it is not up to us to second-guess its author's methods. But the spirit of your question raises an important issue. There is no doubt that this is a difficult journey and that there will be periods of discomfort during the process of letting go of our investment in the ego thought system. In fact, in the manual, of the six stages in the development of trust that Jesus describes, he says four are likely to be experienced as uncomfortable (M-4.I). Then, too, there is much in the Course about the fear, and even terror, that arises from going within and looking at our ego. The ego thought system is not nice--it is an expression from beginning to end of hatred, murder, sacrifice, victimization, specialness, and judgment. But we are told on page after page that it all rests on the mistaken belief that we can and have separated from God and crucified His Son. The truth, though, is that we never separated and could never separate from our Source, and that is why our only responsibility is to accept the Atonement for ourselves (T-2.V.5:1), which we can do only in the context of our ordinary day-to-day experiences that reflect back to us the teacher we have chosen in our minds (T-21.in). Thus, Jesus tells us: \"No one can escape from illusions unless he looks at them, for not looking is the way they are protected. There is no need to shrink from illusions, for they cannot be dangerous ... together we have the lamp that will dispel it [the ego thought system] ... we must look first at this to see beyond it, since you have made it real. We will undo this error quietly together, and then look beyond it to truth\" (T-11.V.1:1-3,5-6). An indispensable part of our process as students of A Course in Miracles is remembering that the ego has no power of its own, only what our minds give it. Looking at our ego manifestations with the Holy Spirit will help us remember that, and therefore we will learn not to take it so seriously, which we do whenever we judge ourselves or others for having an ego. If there were a warning at the beginning of the workbook lessons, Jesus would be saying that the ego is real and that getting in touch with it could be dangerous. But that goes directly against everything he says about the ego and how we should approach it. He is teaching us that the ego has no substance and that it is only a mistaken belief about ourselves that we are holding on to. His emphasis throughout is that we trust him to lead us, and to be as gentle, kind, and patient with ourselves as he is with us, and not force ourselves to work through anything that is too fearful. The opportunity to learn a forgiveness lesson will always be there, and since he does not believe that time is real, he never puts pressure on us to learn our lessons within a certain time frame. If we emulate his gentle guidance with ourselves and others, we will make our way through the rough spots and be fine in the long run. If, however, as is sometimes the case, this process stirs up \"stuff\" that is experienced as overwhelming, then the kind and gentle thing to do would be to seek help from a kind therapist, and then return to the Course process when you are more stable emotionally and psychologically. The unsettling experiences of many students is addressed in other Questions.

Finally, we do not see this as a pointless journey, as it is a means of undoing the mistaken beliefs in our minds that have lead to all of our pain and problems. As long as we continue to react to our bodies and the world as though they were real, then we need help to rid our minds of these illusory thoughts so that we can regain the state of peace in which we were created to live forever."

    "text_input": "Q #1261: If someone loves you, desires a special relationship with you, pledges their devotion and undying love, but you are still not attracted to that person in that way, and prefer to live",
    "output": "alone, does that mean you are afraid of love? Should you consider a special relationship with that person? Ken says in \"Living the Course\" (audio album) that we should not abandon our special relationships, for they are opportunities for learning. Is it wrong to turn away love on the level of form? Are we not told to \"give them what they want\" when they seek love? A: Frequently, students avoid their feelings of attraction to someone because they think that special relationships are bad and should never be entered into. And, just as frequently, students will leave special relationships for the same reason. Both attitudes seriously misconstrue what A Course in Miracles teaches. The point is that our relationships are the curriculum Jesus uses to help us get in touch with the choices we are making in our minds so that we can then shift the purpose for which we are using them from an unholy one (separation) to a holy one (the Holy Spirit's forgiveness process). This does not mean that you should start up a relationship with someone to whom you are not attracted, for the sole purpose of learning lessons. You already have many special relationship classrooms, by virtue of your being the child of parents (alive or deceased), a relative of other family members, a friend, a member of certain groups, an employee/employer, a neighbor, a pet owner possibly, a consumer, a citizen, etc. In other words, you are not deprived of classrooms because you prefer to live alone. Special relationships are in the mind, meaning the way we relate to others reflects the choice we have made in our mind to live out the ego's thought system or the Holy Spirit's thought system. The form or expression of this varies greatly, and is not limited to sexual and romantic partners. The holy relationship is simply the correction of our choice to identify with the ego, and the expression of that choice with others. One of the defining characteristics of special love is that it excludes in some way. On the level of content, in other words, it singles out and separates--not everyone is included in your love. This is the core of specialness. On the other hand, you can spend most of your time with one person, but in content, be excluding no one--this is the nature of a holy relationship, which means you are centered in your right mind. Likewise, in form, you may live alone, but your love, compassion, and forgiveness would extend to everyone, without exception. Since \"love is content, and not form of any kind\" (T-16.V.12:1), you may not necessarily be rejecting love if someone \"loves you, desires a special relationship with you, [and] pledges their devotion and undying love,\" and you do not respond on that level. You need only look within your mind for ego complicity in your decision, some signs being fear, judgment, repulsion, selfishness, anger, vengeance. You can still enfold this person in your love and compassion (content) without being romantically involved with him or her (form). You just want to notice whether there is a \"charge\" to your preference to live alone--if so, then it would be a good idea to ask for help to look at the hidden content. You answer a person's call for love in content, by seeing him or her as one with you, sharing the same interests as God's Son, as both an ego and the Self of Christ. The form of the relationship would then flow from this decision to undo whatever you have used to keep yourself separate from others and from God. That is why Jesus speaks of forgiveness as \"an earthly form of love, which as it is in Heaven has no form\" (W-pI.186.14:2)."

    "text_input": "Q #1262: In knowing that this world holds nothing for me, nothing that I want, and that beyond this world is the world I want (W-pI.128,129), should I be seeing God in everything, or is that validating what is not real?",
    "output": "Seeing God in everything means seeing His purpose in everything. This is not meant literally, of course, because God knows nothing of the world: \"There is no world! This is the central thought the course attempts to teach\" (W-pI.132.6:2-3). It means choosing to identify with the content in our right mind instead of the content in our wrong mind. The world then is seen as a classroom, and our interactions become the means of undoing our thoughts of separation from everyone else and from God. We learn to use the world for this purpose of correcting our thoughts, which replaces our former purpose of using the world to further our existence as separate, special, bodily selves. Our eyes will continue to see the same things, but our perception of what our eyes see will be vastly different, meaning we will \"see\" that we all share the same interests and the same split mind. A gradual reduction of tension and conflict and a growing sense of inner peace will flow from this new purpose. #918 also discusses the meaning of these lessons."

    "text_input": "Q #1263: If God is not aware of the world, or our separation from Him, then why did we have a Jesus for Atonement?",
    "output": "The principle of the Atonement states that the separation never happened; there is no separated Son of God, no sin, no world, and no need for redemption or salvation. This is what we refer to as Level One discourse in A Course in Miracles. But since we clearly believe we exist as individuals in a world that is quite real, the Course talks to us on that level, too: Level Two. In that context, the Atonement principle represents the part of our split mind that remembers the truth of Oneness, and corrects all of the misperceptions we have about God, Jesus, ourselves, and the world. Having listened to the ego's tale of a vengeful God intent on punishing us for attacking Him and making up a world to replace Him, we fear God and seek to make amends in hopes of avoiding the horrible fate we believe we deserve. The Course presents a gentle, though decisive, correction of these terrifying concepts, which have dominated religious traditions for thousands of years. Thus, in place of the biblical Jesus who carries out his Father's Will through sacrificial crucifixion and then bodily resurrection, A Course in Miracles presents a loving, non-judgmental Jesus who is the reflection of God's Love in our mind. He thus symbolizes the love in our own minds that we had split off, and, as would an older and wiser brother, helps us recognize the sinlessness in each other and ourselves, thus easing our fears and gaining our trust. Then, through our practice of forgiveness, we gradually withdraw our belief in the insane idea that we had ever separated from God. To summarize, Atonement, according to A Course in Miracles, is the happy truth that we were mistaken in believing that we ever did something that put us in need of salvation. Expanded discussions of these core ideas may be found in Questions #328, #459, and #616, which also provide references to passages in the Course that explain and clarify the issues."

    "text_input": "Q #1264: Can you guide me through the process of forgiveness? I have been reading your answers and understand that it is my own projection of guilt that is causing my pain. My current cause of pain is one in which a tenant owes me over $2,000. Although the tenant has now been evicted, I am faced with a decision to file a civil law suit, which may not result in retrieving the back rent, or letting the whole thing go. Since I want to use this experience to get out of this hell of reality on this planet, I do not know which decision to make. Will my ego just become more incensed, or will the Holy Spirit actually lead me out of this insanity called life on earth? Please start with a concrete definition of forgiveness. A: Forgiveness is the undoing of everything we made to take the place of our reality as Christ in Heaven, accepting the Atonement principle that states we never left our Source. Not a very satisfying definition! The problem is that forgiveness really cannot be understood or deemed useful without setting it in the context of the entire thought system that Jesus presents in this course. But you have already grasped a major chunk of the Course's metaphysics and its process of forgiveness in understanding that the projection of your guilt is the source of your pain. Projection makes perception is the key principle (T-21.in.1:1). That means that your view of life on this planet as hell and insanity is reflecting what you think is true about yourself in your mind, but have denied and then projected. In other words, you are interpreting the world through the eyes of your guilt. As Jesus expresses it, the world \"is the witness to your state of mind, the outside picture of an inward condition\" (T-21.in.1:5). The meaning that the world holds for us comes entirely from the choice we make in our minds to accept either the ego or Jesus as our teacher. Our internal experience of the world, therefore, tells us which teacher we have chosen. Based on this much, your question should not be, Should I proceed with the law suit or not? but rather, Which teacher do I want to have guide me? Guide you in what?--in making fear and guilt real, or in letting go of your belief in their reality. Nothing else is relevant in the situation. If you choose Jesus (or the Holy Spirit) as your teacher, your purpose will be to learn that you are guiltless, and Jesus can use either option to help you with that. The purpose of what you do is important in releasing you from hell, not what you do. If you can identify with love for just an instant, you will automatically know whether to proceed with the law suit or not; and you will be peaceful. That is the goal. Even if you have no clear sense of what to do, you can still be peaceful, for forgiveness teaches you that your peace and security are within you, completely independent of external circumstances. You would then just do what makes the most sense to you; but the situation would no longer have a charge to it, and you would not have an investment in the way it turns out. #953 adds another helpful perspective to this. Remember, hell and insanity are the outcome of our choice to make sin and guilt real in our minds; they have nothing to do with what appears to be the outside world. And therefore the only way out of hell and insanity is to reverse that choice. That is what forgiveness is. And that is the meaning of the lesson \"I loose the world from all I thought it was,\" which echoes the text in saying, \"The world is nothing in itself. Your mind must give it meaning. And what you behold upon it are your wishes, acted out so you can look on them and think them real\" (W-pI.132.4:1- 3). And so, Jesus teaches us, \"To free the world from every kind of pain is but to change your mind about yourself\" (W-pI.132.10:2). Look within, then, with Jesus as your gentle, loving eyes, and see the peace and quiet beyond the made-up insanity that has no power to change your reality as God's beloved creation. Thus does Jesus say of forgiveness, that it \"is still, and quietly does nothing ... It merely looks, and waits, and judges not\" (W-pII.1.4:1,3).",

I let him know that I had two healthy and whole children, and if there was a special-needs child that needed to come here that he thought I could care for, that I would be his vessel. My gift from the source is now ten years old. But as my studies of A Course in Miracles expand, I feel that maybe my \"God's\" gift is an ego script. As I look at my beautiful child who will never understand the Course's words but will walk the walk of love, I wonder what was it that I asked for and received.",
    "output": "There is no need to go back into the past--you did what you thought was best at the time. There is no way of knowing whether you were right-minded or wrong-minded in making your request for a special-needs child. It would benefit you more, in terms of your spiritual process, to focus on your relationship with this child in the present. And what that really means is being aware of any ego needs you might have that are being played out in the relationship. Whatever was unhealed in your mind ten years ago is still there, and therefore is still being projected in the present. Looking gently and without judgment at the ego-motivated choices you become aware of right now is how the healing of your mind takes place. Time is irrelevant to this process. It might also be helpful to realize that, in a sense, we are all special-needs children! We did unimaginable damage to our minds by choosing individual specialness instead of staying with the unity and wholeness in which we were created as extensions of infinite Love. To make matters worse, we then split ourselves off from the Voice within our minds that was reminding us, and still is, that our separation from Love was only a tiny, mad idea, and that we never did what we thought we did. Everyone of us, without exception, and regardless of the form of limitation or handicap, shares the same content in our minds--both the pain of being separate from our Source, and the Call to deny this denial of the truth, in recognition of our oneness as God's eternally loved Son."

    "text_input": "Q #1267: Is there any way within A Course in Miracles to help someone who has died? My niece was very troubled when she passed away two years ago prior to my starting the Course. At that time I prayed as I had always done, believing it would help somehow; but now I'm not sure how to approach it in the context of the Course. Can a holy relationship be established in a case like this?",
    "output": "All that is required to establish a holy relationship is to ask for help to change the purpose of the relationship from an ego-motivated one to a Holy Spirit-motivated one. This means shifting from seeing your interests as separate from your niece's to seeing them as shared. That she is no longer physically present is not relevant to this process, as what this is ultimately about is undoing your unholy relationship with your ego, which means undoing your belief in separation. How effective a way to practice this! You shift toward the holy relationship by recognizing that both you and your niece are one on the level of mind, both having a wrong mind, a right mind, and the power to choose between them. Death was made by the ego as one of many strategies to prevent us from ever regaining this realization of our oneness as minds. A holy relationship, thus, corrects our erroneous perceptions of each other, which are all aimed at eradicating any sense that we are one as God's Son. The body simply embodies our mind's insane wish to be other than that. Try, then, to recognize how you are perceiving your niece as different and separate from you-- by seeing her, for example, as victimized and powerless in the face of her inadequacies and weaknesses, and that you can help her out of that bind. A better approach would be to think of her as sharing with you both the ego self and the Christ Self, and the power to choose between them. Then respect her choice for the ego, just as you are learning to forgive yourself for choosing your ego, in recognition of the truth of the Atonement that you remain as God created you. Your choice for insanity has no power to change that truth, which defines both you and your niece, as well as everyone else. This will center you in your right mind, and from there love will direct you in a form that will remind others of the love in them, and of the power they have to make the same choice for love that you did. #96 also discusses this topic."

    "text_input": "Q #1268: Is the term \"special relationships\" confined to relationships with people, or does it also apply to everything you are in relation to; e.g, objects, place, animals, work and so on?",
    "output": "Special relationships may be formed with anything at all, although A Course in Miracles focuses primarily on relationships with people. Whenever there is dependency on something external for any reason at all, there is a special relationship. We thus can have a special relationship with a pet, a car, a plant, clean air, a flavor of ice cream, our own body, a job, and so on. The basis of the special relationship is our experience of incompleteness and lack, the result of our decision to leave our true home and our true Identity in God. We (as the one Son) denied that and then projected ourselves from the mind into a deficient, needy, limited body, dependent on a vast array of things and people just to survive physically and psychologically. This false self-perception, maintained by our ongoing decision to identify with the ego thought system of separation, impels us to form one special relationship after another, until we recognize our mistake and then choose to listen to the Teacher Who reminds us of the eternal innocence and invulnerability of the Self we share with everyone. For additional study, you might wish to look at Questions #130 and #340, which discuss pets as part of the Sonship, and #725 focuses on the unitary mind at the source of all perception of differences and fragmentation."

    "text_input": "Q #1269: I have been a student/teacher of A Course in Miracles since 1977. A few years ago, I was \"graced\" with an awareness of my Oneness and my Totality with all that is. The experience is, of course, beyond verbal description. My life was forever transformed. The knowing was  transcendent. Can you tell me how others who have \"been there\" and are \"in the world but not of it\" are responding to such an awareness?",
    "output": "We have answered other Questions along these lines, and we refer you to them for discussion and references to helpful passages in the Course: #39 and #101. In general, what would characterize the experience of a healed mind is the effortlessness of life, because there would no longer be any interference or opposition to love's presence. Love would just flow through, answering all calls for help in forms that would be accepted without fear. There are no visible signs that distinguish an egoless person from one who is still processing, other than that the egoless person perhaps smiles more frequently (W-pI.155.1). To truly know and experience that we are all one and that whatever seems to separate us is totally false simplifies one's life immensely, in that it relieves all the intensity and conflict normally associated with life as an individual, vulnerable, competitive, physical/psychological self."

    "text_input": "Q #1270: Three years ago I ended a long-term relationship with a man who was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, and who also suffered from psychotic episodes. Eventually, I saw clearly how my ego had kept me miserable and trapped, and in my desperation I was able to find and embrace A Course in Miracles, which ended my nightmares and a potential breakdown. The gentleman recently contacted me, promising to have changed and wanting to be with me again. I heard this from him many times before. It evoked fear in me, as I never again want to be as miserable as I was. Just as importantly, I want to respond differently to him, with so much more love, and without so many imagined needs. I think I can. When I am quiet, I hear \"step aside,\" and let what will happen, happen, without trying to control. There is also, however, a voice--echoed by many loved ones--saying, \"Don't be stupid, the guy's a psychopath!\" I've asked him for six months of silence before I respond. I feel like I need to get ready for what feels like a big and scary test. Do you have any advice on how to prepare for it? On how to overcome these voices of caution? A: As much as we wish it were otherwise, A Course in Miracles focuses only on the content in our minds, and not on behavior (form). Nevertheless, what it recommends that we do in our minds is extremely helpful, as that is where the root of all our problems and pain lies, and so that is where the solution is as well. Thus, what you might find helpful in approaching your dilemma is to go within and become aware as best you can of all judgment and fear you may have about the relationship, and any investment you have in how it should turn out. Then calmly and quietly try to let go of all that, just for an instant. Recall Jesus' help with this in Lesson 189: \"Simply do this: Be still, and lay aside all thoughts of what you are and what God is; all concepts you have learned about the world: all images you hold about yourself. Empty your mind of everything it thinks is either true or false, or good or bad ... come with wholly empty hands unto your God\" (W-pI.189.7:1-2,5). You may recall that when Helen (the scribe of the Course) asked Jesus what she should say to someone who was in need of her help, he basically told her that that was not the right question. Instead of asking what she should say to this person, she should ask for help in getting her judgments out of the way. Then love would simply flow through her, and her concern would disappear.",
    "output": "There really is no right or wrong in these kinds of situations. It is a matter of suspending all judgment so that the most loving thing for everyone involved would be done. Just be sure you have no preconceived notion of what the most loving thing is. For example, many students feel that it is never loving to break off a relationship and disappoint the other person. Not so! That could be the most loving thing to do--for both partners. But it could also be loving not to break it off. Search your mind for these kinds of preconceived notions. We would also caution you about one other mistake that students of this course frequently make. Many have concluded that just because a lesson is very difficult, they should go ahead and do it; for example, stay in an abusive relationship because that's the best way of learning you are not a body! That is not at all in keeping with the gentleness of our teacher in this course. Jesus would never coerce us in that way, or put that kind of pressure on us. That would be more like the no- pain-no-gain approach, or that of the ascetic traditions that encourage sacrifice and selfabnegation. From the Course's point of view, that breeds further separation, not the undoing of it. But this does not mean that you should not go back to the relationship. Just try to keep your focus turned quietly inward to the content in your mind, and there, enfolded in Jesus' comforting peace and love, let go of whatever judgments you come upon. The love that the judgments and fear have concealed will guide you, and you will be peaceful."

    "text_input": "Q #1271: A Course in Miracles has helped me to begin to understand so much of what was a source of confusion to me in the past. Being brought up as a Catholic and then rejecting it, I also rejected some of my family in the process and now realize that this was unnecessary. However, I would like some help in reaching out to them (and others) without getting into conflict about the principles of the Course, because in the past there has always been so much resistance when any idea that didn't agree with theirs was expressed. Yet, in their own lives they appear to be such \"good people\" and I felt like a \"bad person\" because I rejected the faith. I now feel so excited about some of the \"revelations\" I've had and want to share them; but before I even approach my family (who do not live near me) I need to calm this sense that they will strongly resist the Course. Perhaps I should not mention it but just try to demonstrate my feelings by how I behave. A: Demonstrating what you have learned from A Course in Miracles is probably the best approach, and this really has nothing to do with behavior (form); it is solely a matter of what is going on in your mind, your thinking (content). The main content to focus on is that your interests are not separate from your family's. Although you are on different paths with different theologies, you still share the same split mind and the power to choose between the thought system that each represents. Thus, instead of visiting your family to share the revelations and experiences you've had, you could shift the purpose to seeing the visit as an opportunity to bring all of your perceptions of differences to the love of Jesus in your right mind, which would then allow you to learn how to minimize the differences in form and concentrate more on the content you share in common. With this approach, you may find that you have little need to talk about the Course at all, unless it is brought up, of course--in which case, your purpose would still be the same: to learn and practice the right-minded perception that you all share equally in the Sonship. The love in you would then be expressed in whatever form is best for everyone in the situation, and you would have no investment in whether your family accepts you or not. What we are asked to demonstrate is that Jesus lives in us (T-11.VI.7:4), which means that his thought system of forgiveness lives in us. He demonstrated that sin has no effect and so is not a",
    "output": "cause, and therefore does not exist, which means nothing can change the love that we are as the one Son of God. He asks that we demonstrate this in our relationships, which we do by our choice to remain identified with that love no matter what is happening externally. The message we thus give to all we meet is the same message Jesus gives to us: you can make the same choice I did, for our minds are joined. All of this, once again, takes place only in our minds. With that as your primary focus, then the expression in form would occur automatically, requiring no deliberation on your part. Always try to keep in the forefront of your thinking that your only responsibility is to accept the Atonement for yourself (T-2.V.5:1), and that the extension of the miracle is not up to us (T-16.II.1-2)."

    "output": "When you take either attack or praise personally, you are denying that you are as God created you--invulnerable, complete, and innocent. The key point is taking the praise personally, in the sense that you need it in some way, that it makes you feel better than you did before you received it. That would just be another indication that you have identified with the ego, which always would induce a sense of lack and incompleteness, because to identify with the ego is to reject the wholeness of your Self as Christ. Taking praise personally could also reinforce a sense of separation if you perceive it as given to you and not to someone else, or if it results in a feeling of superiority or of difference from the giver of the praise. This, of course, does not mean that you cannot graciously accept and acknowledge praise when offered, but you would know that it is irrelevant to your inner state of peace. In your right mind, you take nothing personally, while being fully present to others."

    "output": "It is not uncommon for students to have a reaction of some kind when they begin the lessons, and then when significant shifts are made. A major theme in A Course in Miracles is the ego's fear of our becoming aware that we have chosen the ego as our teacher and that we are beginning to think that that was a mistake. That ego fear can be expressed in many different ways; physical illness is one. A major part of the ego's strategy is to get our attention away from our minds and back to the body, so that we will be less inclined to question the reality of the body. That ensures the ego's survival, which it tries to convince us is our salvation. #118 discusses this aspect of our process, and it also provides some references in the Course that can be helpful in understanding the ego's involvement in our practice of the Course."

How would you know that an argument pro or contra doing the Course is part of our resistance or part of our healthy \"healed\" Self? There seems to be a voice in me that likes to take a lesson from the Course, but at the same time they seem to be making me sick rather than healthy. Is that part of my \"false\" perception, or already part of the healthy aspect of myself that says that A Course in Miracles takes detours into sickness rather than health? Would you say there is a point in Course practice where we would have to let it go in order to come to its full understanding or would that be another trick from the ego providing me with the reasons for resisting the Course's teaching? A: Valid concerns, indeed! From one point of view, yes, it is absurd to be engaged in undoing something that never happened. That sounds like insanity. And it is! In fact, Jesus uses some form of the word insane more than 150 times in the Course. He tells us more than once that we are seeing and hearing things that are not there, and that we are believing the incredible. Such a mind is truly in need of healing! Yet, this insanity is not real, which is why he says, \"You need no healing to be healed. In quietness, see in the miracle a lesson in allowing Cause to have Its Own Effects, and doing nothing that would interfere\" (T-28.I.10:8-9). And throughout the Course, especially in the workbook lessons, Jesus helps us become aware of how we are interfering and what to do about it so that nothing but the love in which we were created will be in our awareness. Jesus once was talking to Helen (scribe of the Course) about her relationship with Bill, and he said that the intensity of her hatred for Bill--a mutual \"wish to get rid of each other\"--was something she was not fully aware of, but that she needed to deal with: \"Your hatred is not real, but it is real to you. It hides what you really want\" (Absence from Felicity, second edition, pp. 297-98). So, too, with us. Our bodies and the world are real to us; our physical and emotional pain is real to us; and our longing for peace is real to us. That is enough to justify our decision to practice this course, because it teaches us how to recognize and then let go of what we have made to hide true peace and love from ourselves. Our understanding is not needed--our trust is. (See T-18.IV.7-8; W-in.8.) Jesus needs us to be humble enough to admit that we are too mixed up about things to be able to help ourselves, but that if we place ourselves in his hands, he guarantees that our minds will be restored to the eternal peace in which they were created, and in which they always abide. One thing that we do need to recognize clearly, however, is that the ego part of our minds is going to fiercely resist the transition from mindlessness to mindfulness that our practice of the lessons will surely bring about. That part of our minds stores our decision for the insanity of separation over the sanity of our oneness as God's Son, and therefore we will inevitably encounter strong resistance to the continual practice of this course. That resistance, and the intense fear motivating it, will be expressed in the form of emotional or physical discomfort, problems, relationship conflicts, \"accidents\"--anything at all that will re-focus our attention on the body and the world. That fear and resistance must be respected and treated with compassion, patience, and gentleness. But there is no need to rush through this process--coercion of any kind always comes from the ego, not from Jesus, who knows time is unreal, and that the truth about us remains untouched by our seeming attacks on it."

    "text_input": "Q #1275: I recently listened to your audio series about the stages of spirituality, \"On the Three Metamorphoses:\" I have a hard time understanding what it means to be a camel. Do I have enough life experience to move on to being a lion? Do I have access to Jesus' love, or am I only subject to the ego's hate? I have survived. That's about it. Not triumphed. I've managed to hold down my job for three years and barely drink anymore. I think I've learned from many of my mistakes and am learning to be loving to myself and am letting go more of self-judgment. I feel somewhat more peaceful. What does it mean to be true to classroom I have chosen for myself so we can release the guilt within? Does being true to the classroom also mean being a whole person according to the ego? Does ordinary functionality mean that I am subject to the idea that only real men have been in fights so then to be a true camel and whole I must prove my manhood and be in a fight to be true to the classroom? A: We can talk in general about what it means to be true to the classroom we have chosen, but ultimately that is something that must be defined by each person, because there are so many different kinds of classrooms and so many variations in each type of classroom. Then, too, it is virtually impossible to come up with a definition of normal that everyone would agree with, just as there is no notion of what it means to be a real man that everyone would agree with, although I think we can safely say that you do not have to get into a fight to prove your manhood --that's just silly.",
    "output": "One way of approaching this for yourself is to look for the negative--something you are running away from or strenuously avoiding in yourself. This would entail more than just having certain preferences, which we all have. If you have become reasonably comfortable living in society, chances are you are being true to your classroom as a human being in the world. Again, what this means specifically is virtually impossible to delineate because it not just about form: you could be a hermit out in the wilderness and still be a well-adjusted human being, or you could be a celebrity constantly in the public eye and be a neurotic basket-case, unable to function on your own. Externals do not necessarily indicate the state of one's inner life. Our classrooms are also individualized, meaning we are not just human beings--we are parents, children, male, female, citizens, employees, employers, teammates, neighbors, friends, etc. If you are a parent, for example, you need to be true to that classroom and fulfill your responsibilities to your children; if you are the head of your department at work, then you need to function authoritatively in that position; if you are married, then you need to carry out the responsibilities of that relationship. You do not have to be perfect on any of these levels, and you do not have to be free of hang-ups and neuroses, but being aware of your weaknesses and neurotic tendencies is important. What is detrimental to progress is using spirituality as a way of escaping from aspects of yourself or the world that you find too overwhelming to confront and deal with. That is all too common, and students of A Course in Miracles are not immune to this. But, again, you do not have to be perfect, as Jesus reminds us: \" ... be not disturbed that shadows surround it [your willingness]. That is why you came. If you could come without them you would not need the holy instant\" (T-18.IV.2:4-6; see also M-26.4:1-2). We bring what is in need of healing to the healing love of Jesus; but we cannot do that if we are not aware of our limitations, our guilt and hatred, our need for specialness, etc. We need to have some awareness of how our ego is functioning in our lives, and we have to have learned through experience that the world will not provide the healing we now perceive we need. That is the transition to the lion stage. #1126 discusses some aspects the camel-to-lion theme; and our publication The Healing Power of Kindness, Vol. Two: Forgiving our Limitations might also be helpful to you as you work through this issue."

It says: \"The opposite of love is fear, but what is all- encompassing can have no opposite\" (T-in.1:8). Clearly what is all-encompassing must be love and not fear. Therefore, if love can have no opposite, its opposite cannot be fear. It would appear that the sentence should read: \"The opposite of fear is love, but what is all-encompassing can have no opposite.\" A: We do not find a problem with the logic. Since love is all-encompassing, it cannot have an opposite. We would tend to think of fear as the opposite of love, but since there can be no opposite to what is all-encompassing, fear is impossible. That is the point--fear is not real.",

    "text_input": "Q #1277: The Course says, \"Whenever you are not wholly joyous, it is because you have reacted with a lack of love to one of God's creations\" (T-5.VII.5:1). My question is: How can we perceive God's creations if the world is not of His making? It seems impossible to simultaneously look within and without, to see the light and the \"darkness,\" the Christ Mind, and the world as we know it. Am I to meditate constantly like the Indian gurus who sit and \"do nothing\" all day? How can I live in this world AND react lovingly to one of God's creations? How would I recognize one of God's creations, especially if I live alone?",
    "output": "There is probably nothing in A Course in Miracles that causes students more confusion than its use of the term, God's creations. Jesus never fully defines this term because, from our perspective as separate beings within this physical world, there really is no way we could fully understand what he means. However, we can begin to comprehend what he is talking about and asking of us, if we bring together several different statements he makes. \"To create is to love. [Love] creates forever, but not in time. God's creations have always been, because He has always been ... In Christ's sight, the world and God's creation meet, and as they come together all perception disappears ... You are merely asked to return to God the mind as He created it ... to return your thinking to the point at which the error was made, and give it over to the Atonement in peace\" (T-7.I.3:5-7; W-pII.271.1:3; T-5.VII.2:6; 6:5). In other words, when the Course speaks of creation, it is not talking about anything physical. Rather, it means the extension of God's all-encompassing Love. Because it is all encompassing, it cannot help but extend. In this way, it creates forever because it goes on and on without end. This is in contrast to the ego's guilt, which, as a thought of difference and separation, can only project and produce illusion, or what the Course calls miscreation. So, God's creations are simply His extensions of Love. Of course, in reality God does not extend Love, He is the Love of which we are a part. But, as Course students, we should remember that Jesus is not obsessed with accuracy in language. While he speaks to us in dualistic terms because that is what we can understand, he ultimately wants us to move beyond his words to his underlying, non-dualistic message. With that in mind, we can consider what he means when he asks us to \"return to God the mind as He created it.\" He does not literally mean that God as a dualistic being created the mind. Instead, he means that the natural state of our mind--the state of being filled with love--comes from God. And so our job is to return our thinking to the point at which we chose the ego's guilt over the memory of God's Love. We do this by asking the Holy Spirit in our mind to help us correct this error--a correction that will leave us filled with love and thus wholly joyous. This is an internal process of correction that happens entirely in the mind. Whether we live alone or meditate is irrelevant. What does matter is that we use our reactions to what we perceive in the world to tell us whether we have chosen the ego or the Holy Spirit as our internal Teacher. Thus, the path the Course lays out is not about overcoming or blocking out the darkness of the world in order to find the light within. Rather, it is about realizing that the darkness without is no barrier to our finding peace within, unless we want it to be."

    "text_input": "Q #1278: I have recently begun studying A Course in Miracles, and I absolutely love it! However, I am also a recent graduate with a degree in evolutionary biology, and I am just wondering about the Course's view on the evidence for evolution? Did the God in A Course in Miracles also create non-human animals, and does He have a role in natural selection? Did He create the earth over three billion years ago? I know there is no such thing as time in the Course, but how do we account for the numerous studies involving radio-carbon dating, all of which show that the elements of the earth's crust have been around for billions of years? If God created us all as perfect beings, why did nature \"experiment\" with so many other life forms and habitats before man came to inhabit the planet? What are the Course's views on other scientific phenomenon, such as the laws of gravity and motion? A: The foundation of everything taught in A Course in Miracles is its view of reality as nondualistic. Nothing finite or quantitative is real, which means that not only is time not real, but neither is the cosmos. Only the realm of God, which is perfect Oneness, and the nonspatial extension of His Being as spirit is real. Therefore, in the Course, there is no connection between God and the world, as there is in the traditional biblical view of God as creator and sustainer of the physical universe. There certainly appears to us to be a world with billions of forms of life and nonliving kinds of things, and so Jesus addresses us as minds believing in what is essentially illusory. On that level of discourse, he talks about the origin of the world as a thought in our minds--the thought of having an existence apart from totality and wholeness. Jesus refers to this as a \"tiny, mad idea at which the Son of God remembered not to laugh\" (T-27.VIII.6:2). Because the \"mad idea\" was taken seriously, the world, then, originated as attack on God (W-pII.3.2:1). Importantly, however, it is never more than an idea that never leaves the mind that thought it-- despite appearances and our experiences of being bound by physical laws (see Lesson 76 \"I am under no laws but God's\" [W-pI.76]). The practice of A Course in Miracles, therefore, centers on our learning how to interact on a daily basis so as not to deny our experiences, but to use them as a means of restoring our minds to sane perception, and then to their original, unchanged state of oneness within God's Being. This reflects the principle that the world is \"the witness to your state of mind, the outside picture of an inward condition\" (T-21.in.1:5).",
    "output": "This view obviously presents many challenges for you with your interest in evolutionary biology. But this would be true for anyone, regardless of profession or interests: \"To learn this course requires willingness to question every value that you hold\" (T-24.in.2:1). The Course is a gentle path, however, and focuses primarily on transforming our perception of ourselves, each other, and the world, so that we will gradually be able to let go of the terrible burdens of guilt, fear, and conflict that we carry with us all the time. This is done through the practice of forgiveness, which directs our attention to the content in our minds that motivates us to relate in either helpful or hurtful ways. If you would like to pursue this further, we recommend reading our answers to Questions #111, #121, #157, #316, and #616."

    "text_input": "Q #1279: You have said that children must develop strong, healthy egos before learning the principles of A Course in Miracles. But I feel very weak, despite being 22 years old. How can I become stronger?",
    "output": "It is tempting to advise you to stay away from the Course for at least another 20 years! But seriously, there is a reason the Course typically attracts people who are middle aged or older. Generally, people spend the first half of their lives developing their skills and abilities and trying to find their way in this world. It is only after they have a firm sense of who they are--and why being that person does not make them happy--that individuals are ready to take on a thought system that asks them to question every value that they hold (T-24.in.2:1). The problem with trying to practice the Course when you are very young is that you can wind up in the conflicted state of attempting to develop yourself and let go of yourself at the same time--often a recipe for mental and emotional pain. Of course, there are exceptions to every rule, and only you can decide when and if A Course in Miracles is the right path for you. However, if your primary issue right now is becoming a stronger, more confident, more fully developed person (the issue most people your age grapple with), then it is likely that you should focus more on exploring and discovering this world than on letting it go. In other words, you can become stronger as an ego by letting yourself be you. Find out what you like and do not like, observe yourself in relationships, and see what skills and talents you most enjoy using. Uncover exactly who you are as the individual you appear to be in this lifetime. Pursue your worldly goals and do not feel guilty for doing so. In the process, know that God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit are not going anywhere. Remember that God's Love, which is the only true strength any of us has, is present for you to receive \"any time and anywhere, wherever you are, and in whatever circumstance you find yourself\" (W-pI.42.2:2)."

    "text_input": "Q #1280: I recently ended a seven-year relationship with a partner I was planning to marry until he told me he wasn't sure. I gave him several weeks to decide, but he was unable to, saying he felt he was not good enough for me. I ended the relationship very sadly and reluctantly, still not knowing what he really wanted. I understand from the Course that everything that happens to us is made by ourselves. I would like to know if this situation, including his uncertainty and his not feeling good enough, was caused by my guilt, because I was looking for something outside  myself. Was I mistaken to want the relationship to move to a deeper level? I am now uncertain if I gave up a loving relationship for the sake of wanting marriage.",
    "output": "A Course in Miracles tells us that this physical life is a dream and that we are the ones dreaming it. So, ultimately, it is true that everything we experience here is of our own making. However, it is not as the individual we think we are that we dreamt all this up. That occurs on a level outside of time and space--a level that we cannot get in touch with or comprehend from within this dream. Therefore, we do not have to take responsibility for all the thoughts, feelings, and actions of everyone around us. In fact, doing so could be very detrimental because, rather than leading us to greater understanding and forgiveness, it tends to root us more deeply in guilt and fear. This is so because the \"I\" that tries to take responsibility is just as made up as that which it is attempting to take credit for. Thus, we wind up wrongly attributing power to a false self that is already terrorized by the mistaken belief that it has the power to destroy Heaven and banish God forever. The message of the Course is exactly the opposite: We do not have power over God. Despite all the horrors we see and pain we feel, not one note in Heaven's song has been missed (T- 26.V.5:4). We remain \"at home in God, dreaming of exile but perfectly capable of awakening to reality\" (T-10.I.2:1). What will help us move toward awakening is not trying to take responsibility for what others do, but rather taking responsibility for our reactions to what they do. Because we script our lives to be full of pain as a defense against remembering God's Love, the key to getting out of our pain is recognizing that it comes not from external circumstances but from our own choice to feel it. The process of the Course consists of asking the Holy Spirit to be our internal Teacher and help us realize that we would be much happier if we chose God's Love over our pain, guilt, and fear. And so, in a situation like the one you have described, the Course would not tell you whether you have made a right or wrong decision. What it would do is encourage you to explore whether you made the decision with the guidance of the ego or the Holy Spirit. Certainly, there is nothing wrong with wanting to get married and deciding you would like a partner who shares that desire. However, since the ending of your relationship was confusing and emotionally difficult and you are now second guessing yourself, it seems likely that there may be other issues involved. None of this is reason to feel guilty. Indeed, virtually everyone here has relationship issues since it was our relationship issue with God that compelled us to fall into this dream in the first place. It does sound, though, like it might be helpful for you to look at the beliefs, feelings, and expectations you have around intimate relationships so that future ones go more smoothly. A good first step would be taking the Holy Spirit's hand and asking Him to help you look at what you have just experienced through His loving and non-judgmental eyes."

This entire paragraph was originally meant for Helen, especially the opening line, \"How can you who are so holy suffer?\" (T-5.IV.8:1). This is a unique passage in A Course in Miracles at this point (Chapter 5), for it is the first time this form appears. It is almost as if Jesus had been dictating the thought system to Helen from a script, which he dropped to sing this lovely little aria. Clearly, it is meant for all of us. It is Jesus' gentle way of saying to us that we can choose again and feel differently--the choice is ours."

I want to show love--and I feel love for them--but it is increasingly awkward. My friends tend to be on spiritual paths (New Age, Yogis, etc.) but they still run down lots of things. I don't want to seem to be trying to change or preach to them. How can I handle this?",
    "output": "A Course in Miracles tells us that in the Holy Spirit's eyes, everything is either love or a call for love (T-14.X.7:1). Thus, when we hear others expressing judgments in a way that is vicious, angry, fearful, and so on, we can know that what they are really doing is responding to a perceived lack of love within themselves. They are viewing the world through the ego's eyes, which tell them that God's Love has been destroyed. Every one of us carries around the unconscious belief that I am the one who destroyed God's Love. And because the guilt this thought induces is overwhelming, the ego tries to give it away by continually finding external targets to blame for the unhappiness it causes--targets ranging from friends and spouses, to political leaders, to our own body. So the ego is always on the make, looking for someone or something with which to be upset. To the ego, finding such targets represents salvation. It is easy, upon reflection, to understand the fallacy of the ego's approach, and it is particularly easy to see it in other people. However, we need to be aware that the ego is tricky. If we find ourselves reacting to and judging something another does--even if it is merely a judgment that he or she should not be judging--we need to recognize that our own ego has been activated. As the Course makes clear, on the level of behavior, salvation does not hinge on either doing or not doing something (T-12.III.2). This is because salvation is not dependent upon behavior. Thus, as Course students, we want to realize that the problem is not the expression of judgment, but rather the underlying fear of love. Therefore, it is not our job to stop others from being judgmental. Instead, we should focus on turning our own mind away from the fear that necessitates judgment in the first place. The process the Course lays out for doing this involves switching from the ego to the Holy Spirit as our internal Teacher. This means that whenever we do not know how to respond lovingly to another, we should ask the Holy Spirit for help. He will always show us how to look upon the other with love and compassion, which will automatically translate to words and actions that reflect His Love. The form of what we say and do will undoubtedly vary from situation to situation, but the content--because it is His content--will always be love. From a loving place, you many even find yourself joining in your friends' tirades. Or, you might find other ways of listening to them without making them wrong. Ultimately, most people do not want their defenses taken away, or even suggestions for another way of looking at their grievances (unless they directly ask for this). What most people want is simply to be heard, to have another person understand that dealing with others and with life in general is hard, and to know that no matter what they tell you, your love and acceptance of them will not waver. When you are able to find this loving state in your mind and have no need for others to be any different than they are, your words will flow without effort and your friends will delight in talking to you."

    "text_input": "Q #1284: Forgiveness is central to the teachings of A Course in Miracles, and there are so many aspects of forgiveness that are identified and discussed in the Course. Also, in this Q & A format and other publications from the Foundation, there are many discussions involving the aspects of how to forgive. All of this can be confusing as to how best to practice forgiveness simply. The question many have is, with all of the aspects and examples of forgiveness, is it as simple as when we are aware of an ego thought to sincerely forgive it and our self without judgment and give it over to the Holy Spirit for healing? There is a wonderful \"forgiveness process\" at the end of Chapter 5 of the text. Is this one we can universally use for every \"unforgiving\" ego thought\"? A: Yes, the process described at the end of Chapter 5 can be used any time you become aware of a thought of unforgiveness.",
    "output": "Forgiveness is described in different ways (as is true of the miracle as well) for several reasons-- and they all have to do with the state of our minds, not the concept or process itself, which is indeed simple. We need to hear it stated in different ways because we perceive situations and circumstances in our lives as being different. Eventually we will learn to generalize and recognize the same content in everything, regardless of the form. Then forgiveness will be very simple. Second, the ego can easily slip into our practice of forgiveness without our realizing it. Our investment in keeping our identities as individuals and as bodies is far greater than we realize, which means we would secretly try to find ways to use the teachings of A Course in Miracles to reinforce that identity (which includes the belief in the reality of sin, guilt, and fear), and we would strenuously resist any teaching we perceive as threatening the reality of that self, which these teachings definitely are. In view of this, the simple--and correct--statement of forgiveness that you gave is subject to misunderstanding and misapplication. As impossible as it may seem, students have misconstrued each of the concepts you included: forgiving an ego thought; forgiving our self without judgment; and giving the ego thought over to the Holy Spirit. We are both attracted to the Course and afraid of it. Our understanding and application of its principles cannot help being affected by this ambivalence, and by our largely unconscious commitment to the ego thought system. That is why Jesus talks about the concept of forgiveness- to-destroy (T-30.VI.1-4; W-pI.126.1-7; S-2.II), for example. He must alert us to the ego's distortions of love's teachings. We have banished the truth from our awareness, and part of us wants to keep it that way, but the other part doesn't. Therefore, we are only going to allow truth in a little at a time --as much as we can tolerate at any instant, but never the full truth all at once. That is why the Course's teachings seem to us to be complicated. They aren't. We are! (See T- 11.VI.3; T-14.I.5.)"

I find it so difficult because he insists on teaching his understanding to me and others and tacitly implies that if I don't agree with what he says, I am not being open to the Holy Spirit in him. It is uncomfortable for me to listen to him, and I am not sure why it bothers me so much. I have implored him not to discuss Course concepts. He takes this personally and accuses me of not letting him be free. Does this relationship make sense?",
    "output": "While only you can know whether this is the right relationship for you, it is definitely possible for two people who interpret A Course in Miracles differently to have a happy partnership. You could disagree with someone and still feel peaceful and loving toward him. The Course teaches us that what generally makes this hard to do is that we are afraid to feel peaceful and loving. This compels us to unconsciously set out looking for reasons to be unhappy with others. We want to find differences and then proclaim, \"Aha! Here is the reason I could never fully love someone like you. And now I know that you are the reason for my unhappiness.\" This strategy ensures that we will remain with our identity intact, certain that the other person is guilty and that we are right--miserable, but justified in feeling so. Indeed, it is not the fact that you do not see eye to eye about the Course that is a problem, but rather your shared decision to make an issue out of the fact that you do not see eye to eye. In other words, your unhappiness stems not from differences in belief or philosophy, but from a perception that you are being attacked and, undoubtedly, a desire to attack back. These are the dynamics we will always set up when we listen to the ego. What seems to be the trigger in the external world is actually irrelevant. This is why there is a saying about relationships that the problem is never the problem. Of course, none of this means you should stay in a relationship that does not feel right to you (nor does it mean that you should leave one). But it does mean that it would be most helpful to stop focusing on your disagreements about the Course or even on how to handle behavior you find unpleasant. Instead, ask the Holy Spirit in your mind to help you watch what is going on and to change the conditions in your own mind that make attack (both giving and receiving it) feel safer than love. When you recognize that the Holy Spirit's Love is already in your mind, you will no longer feel a need to defend yourself by being in conflict. Then, when your partner, or anyone else, acts in a way that you perceive as less than kind, you will know it is a reflection of his own fear and will not take it personally. You will also know the decision to make about your relationship--either staying or leaving not out of anger, guilt, fear, or need, but rather based upon a simple preference and a clear sense of the most loving thing to do."

    "output": "This happens to most students, and in a way it is unavoidable in the beginning stages of one's journey with the Course. The idea is to recognize when you have done so and be willing to ask for help to go beyond that stage so that you will advance, otherwise you will not experience all that A Course in Miracles offers you. If you stay on the level of idols, you would be bringing the Course down to your level instead of raising yourself to its level. That is not sinful and you should not judge yourself for doing so. It is just that you would be preventing yourself from reaching its goal of true and lasting peace. A wonderful paragraph to read in this regard is in the text, Chapter 17, where Jesus asks us, \"Think you that you can bring truth to fantasy, and learn what truth means from the perspective of illusions?\" (T-17.I.5:1).

Is the Holy Spirit leading or helping us once we make the choice to listen so we can stay in right-mindedness?",
    "output": "Divine order exists only in reality, the state of pure undifferentiated Oneness in Heaven. There is nothing random about our seeming existence in the dream on the level of content, for we are always choosing either to stay asleep, which means to relive in some form our choice to remain separate from God, or to awaken, which means to use the relationships and circumstances in our lives to undo that choice for separation. The Holy Spirit is the memory in our minds of our changeless state as God's one Son, Christ. When we recognize our mistake in wanting an existence apart from God, and then ask for help, we initiate the process of looking within at all the ways in which we interfere with the presence of light and love in our right minds. And when we learn to do this without judgment, we are perceiving with the Holy Spirit. That is right- mindedness. We bounce out of that peaceful state when we judge ourselves or others, as that means we have taken the ego seriously and have forgotten it is simply a \"tiny, mad idea,\" deserving only of gentle laughter. The Holy Spirit is the reminder of the ego's nothingness and of Christ's wholeness; and His function is to help us translate this into the daily events of our lives."

It is not helpful to dwell on it, first, because there is no way of knowing why you chose this script, and second, because the only relevant issue now that you are experiencing these conditions is whether you will invite the ego or Jesus to guide you and comfort you. Hear Jesus teach about this choice: \"Temptation has one lesson it would teach, in all its forms, wherever it occurs. It would persuade the holy Son of God he is a body, born in what must die, unable to escape its frailty, and bound by what it orders him to feel. It sets the limits on what he can do; its power is the only strength he has; his grasp cannot exceed its tiny reach. Would you be this, if Christ appeared to you in all His glory, asking you but this: Choose once again if you would take your place among the saviors of the world, or would remain in hell, and hold your brothers there. For He has come, and He is asking this\" (T-31.VIII.1). The ego would have you gaze outward and assess what you do not have. Jesus would have you look within and identify with the treasures that are unconditionally yours. It seems as if you have already experienced the peace of God that is not conditional on anything external, and now part of you is questioning whether that is enough to sustain you--a normal wavering for a mind still split between two allegiances. In the lesson \"I am sustained by the Love of God\" (W-pI.50), Jesus asks us to look at what we place our faith in as a means of sustenance, happiness, and protection. An honest assessment will reveal that our faith is in whatever will enhance and guarantee our continued life as a body. Yet, Jesus teaches us that \"all these things are your replacements for the Love of God\" (W-pI.50.2:1). That is why, however successful we may be in the world's terms, we will never be truly happy and peaceful--we would be living a lie, forcing us to conceal the tremendous guilt and fear that choice engenders. What might help you, therefore, is to look upon your distress as a crisis of trust: is the peace of God enough? is the Love of God enough? If your trust were unconditional, you would not need this course; you would not need a teacher who asks only for \"a little willingness\" (T-18.IV.2). You do not have to be at the top of the spiritual ladder to apply this--Jesus approaches us with this lesson very early in the workbook. What better time to work with the lesson than when you are in the midst of a struggle? \"Do not breathe life into your failing ego,\" Jesus gently urges us in our moment of wavering (T-17.V.8:4). This obviously will not get you a job or money or other things you would like to have; and it is not meant to deny the frustration of not being able to get a job despite your many attempts to do so. This course should not be used as a means of avoiding one's responsibilities in the world under the guise of spiritual advancement, although, unfortunately, it has been used that way by many. Its purpose is to help us see that the only meaningful aspect of our lives is learning how to use our experiences as a way of getting in touch with the content in our minds that we are always choosing. As we choose against the ego and for Jesus and his thought system of forgiveness more and more, we will approach our problems entirely differently--not that we will ignore them, but that we will no longer give them power to disrupt the peace that defines us as God's Son. Jesus thus encourages us: \"You have surely begun to realize that this is a very practical course, and one that means exactly what it says. I would not ask you to do things you cannot do, and it is impossible that I could do things you cannot do. Given this, and given this quite literally, nothing can prevent you from doing exactly what I ask, and everything argues for your doing it. I give you no limits because God lays none upon you\" (T-8.IX.8:1-4)."

    "text_input": "Q #1289: I know the goal of A Course in Miracles is to move toward seeing shared interests with people as opposed to separate interests, but part of me is resisting this. I struggle to understand how I am supposed to see shared interests with someone who just got sent to prison for murder or with a convicted rapist. Maybe I just don't have a good understanding of exactly what shared interest means and how to apply the concept practically to my everyday life. Could you please help with this?",
    "output": "To understand the Course's concept of shared interest, or shared purpose, you have to recognize that the Course is never talking about bodies. Indeed, the Course tells us that the physical world and our existence within it are illusory. Thus, being an illusion, bodies have no inherent purpose. However, they can serve the purpose that the mind gives them. And, within this dream, there are only two purposes: to stay planted in this painful, made-up world with our fear buried and our personal identity intact; or, to remember our real identity as God's one Son and awaken to our true home in Heaven. The Course states, \"God gave you and your brother Himself, and to remember this is now the only purpose that you share. And so it is the only one you have\" (T-24.1.7:5-6). In other words, the one and only purpose that has any meaning in reality (and thus will lead us beyond this dream) is the recognition that the Love of God is still in our mind and is available to us anytime we choose it. Because, in reality, we are not separate, the separate interests we seem to have as bodies are not real either. Learning that this is so will gradually lessen our fear and guilt until, eventually, we are ready to awaken. That is the interest that we share. Again, to put it another way: The one and only need any of us really has is to realize that choosing the ego's pain and guilt makes us miserable while choosing God's Love would make us very happy. That remains our only need regardless of whether we have lived a seemingly admirable or contemptible life. Therefore, in this way, you share exactly the same need as a murderer or rapist. Of course, this has nothing to do with behavior or the issue of holding people accountable for their actions. Most of the time, it would hardly be loving or productive to simply excuse criminal behavior. But what it does mean on a practical level is that we can hold the criminal accountable without hating him. We can recognize that he made a different choice in response to the same fear and guilt that is in our own mind. In this way, we step beyond our fear into love and compassion, realizing that our doing so helps our brother and that his doing the same would be helpful to us."

    "output": "That is how the ego would perceive it, and then the temptation would be to toss A Course in Miracles into the unholy spiritual junk heap. That couldn't be the meaning of \"advanced teachers,\" though, if the Course's message is understood correctly. Its whole approach is to restore to our minds the awareness of our oneness as God's Son and to help us realize that all forms of specialness represent a rejection of that oneness (T-16.V.2:3; T-17.IV.2:7). The startling feature of spiritual advancement according to A Course in Miracles is the joyful acceptance of our sameness and a corresponding disinterest in having or being something that is not shared with everyone else. An attraction to all-inclusiveness and selflessness replaces the former ego-generated attraction to exclusivity and self-importance. Thus, specialness fades into its own nothingness as one advances along the path. Inspired by the Holy Spirit, you would recognize in someone who appears to be beyond the ego but a reflection of your own holiness, rather than someone who has something you do not have. The ten characteristics of God's teachers described in the manual (M-4) lead to a state that is the exact opposite of specialness. An advanced teacher would be indistinguishable from others, except perhaps that he or she would smile more frequently (W-pI.155.1)."

    "text_input": "Q #1291: A Course in Miracles says: \"As you teach so you shall learn\" (T-5.IV.6:4; T-6.I.6:1), but do others learn what you teach or do they only learn what they teach?",
    "output": "This seems like a fairly simple question calling for a simple answer. It isn't, though, because the Course's approach to teaching and learning differs significantly from the world's, which rests on the premise that everyone's interests are separate from everyone else's. This is the mistake that Jesus attempts to correct throughout the Course. In this context, the idea \"as you teach so shall you learn\" flows from the general Course principle that giving and receiving are the same, the correction of the ego's deception that what you give to another you lose, and that you can affect another without affecting yourself (see W-pI.108.1-7; W-pI.126, W-pI.187.) The world's emphasis on form at the expense of content is what sustains this ego approach. The most concentrated discussion of this issue is found in the Introduction to the manual for teachers. We quote only in part, but the entire Introduction is relevant. \"The role of teaching and learning is actually reversed in the thinking of the world. The reversal is characteristic. It seems as if the teacher and the learner are separated, the teacher giving something to the learner rather than to himself. Further, the act of teaching is regarded as a special activity, in which one engages only a relatively small proportion of one's time. The course, on the other hand, emphasizes that to teach is to learn, so that teacher and learner are the same. It also emphasizes that teaching is a constant process; it goes on every moment of the day, and continues into sleeping thoughts as well. To teach is to demonstrate. There are only two thought systems, and you demonstrate that you believe one or the other is true all the time. From your demonstration others learn, and so do you ... You cannot give to someone else, but only to yourself, and this you learn through teaching ... Teaching but reinforces what you believe about yourself ... the self you think is real is what you teach\" (M-in.1; 2:1-3; 3:7,10) We generally equate teaching with form. Thus, for example, I may say that by profession I am a teacher and that I teach subjects in which I have expertise, which might include A Course in Miracles. This implies that I have what my students lack and I am going to supply them with it. While this analysis is correct on the level of form, we need to remember that this is a course in content: \"This is a course in cause and not effect\" (T-21.VII.7:8) is how the text expresses it. Effect is the form or behavior, having to do only with bodies and the world, whereas cause is in the mind and reflects either the ego's content--guilt, separation, fear, and hate--or the Holy Spirit's --forgiveness, peace, and healing. The Course, therefore, emphasizes only content, and so teaching, according to the manual, has nothing to do with behavior or form. On the level of form, my true interest as a teacher is the same as your interest as a student, and that is to learn that the Holy Spirit's thought system is true and the ego's is false. Therefore we are the same in content--what I teach, I learn; what you learn, you teach. Teachers and learners alike share the thought systems of the ego and the Holy Spirit, and the power to choose between them. Again, it is not my demonstration of expertise in a particular subject matter that is important, but the demonstration that either the ego's or Holy Spirit's thought system is true. I teach the ego's separation by my special relationship with you, while I teach the Holy Spirit's Atonement by transcending specialness, choosing to see our interests as shared. Your \"learning\" reinforces the decision you made for the thought system of separation or Atonement. For example, your special relationship with me--regardless of its form--reflects that you believe that separation is real and that your needs have to be fulfilled at my expense. If I am coming from that same point of view, my interaction will tell you that you made the right choice. Since egos are attack and I have identified with my ego, I will attack you. Thus do I give the ego's gift by reinforcing its message that you are an innocent victim; and you, of course, reciprocate. And so we continue our dance of death: my decision for the ego reinforces your own, which strengthens my decision that in turn strengthens yours--and both of us lose. However, when I am in my right mind and not defensive, and I perceive our shared interests, my right-mindedness calls you to choose peace as I have. The peace you experience coming through me is now yours, if you so choose. Yet, if you are in your right mind and I am not, and I attack you as the object of my specialness, your defenseless non-judgment teaches me, even though I may be in the role of teacher. Your not becoming upset demonstrates that my attack had no effect, and thus you remind me that I have another choice."

    "text_input": "Q #1292: Although, the Course does not specifically mention it, Ken Wapnick (in his publications) makes it clear that Jesus is speaking to the separated portion of the mind (which is outside time and space) that is mentally reviewing the video we call our lives. He calls this the decision maker. Within the metaphysics of separation is there only one decision maker reviewing all our lives, or is there a separate decision maker reviewing each life? Was the second split a split from a single ego mind into separate decision makers and then into the physical universe?",
    "output": "The second split is the mind itself splitting into two parts: the part that holds the ego thought system of separation (the wrong mind) and the part that holds the correction of that thought system (the right mind). This split symbolizes the Son's decision to separate himself from anything that would remind him of his true origin in God, and hold on to only what will ensure his cherished existence as autonomous and independent. At this stage, there is still only one Son, meaning there is one decision maker. This choice then unleashes a series of strategic moves that result ultimately in the mind's splitting into many minds, and finally into entities that are totally unaware of mind (i.e., bodies). Insofar as we relate to ourselves and others as individuals with separate lives, it is helpful to think in terms of each of us having our own decision maker. However, as we learn to relate more to the idea that we are minds all sharing the same wrong-minded and right-minded content and the power to choose either, the idea of individual decision makers will gradually fade away by itself. Getting back to our identity as mind is part of our journey back to the state of oneness, so that whatever implies that separation is real will slowly dissolve the more we identify with mind. It is essential to remember as you dwell on the metaphysical dimension of A Course in Miracles that Jesus is presenting these teachings in the context of a myth that uses language and a framework that are meaningful to us in our separated state. Thus, because we generally think about everything in terms of time and space, we always try to understand our process in quantitative terms--when, where, how many, etc. That is one reason the Course comes in the form it does; but it is not like that at all. Jesus is helping us get in touch with a process that is non-temporal and non-spatial, and ultimately one that is illusory through and through. So, as intriguing as the theory is, it is best not to expend a great deal of effort trying to figure it all out, as if one were studying a schematic for a major building project. Our questions will all evaporate once we begin to have the experience that our practice of forgiveness will inevitably yield. There are other discussions about the nature of the decision maker, which also provide helpful references: Questions #663, #713, and #715."

    "text_input": "Q #1293: I work with two people whose work habits I do not respect. There is no supervisor in our area and they take full advantage of this. I no longer criticize or try to change them, as they are very defensive, and the Course says that you can't change anyone anyway. Instead, on the level of form, I now interact with them only on work-related issues. When they attack me, I am able to choose another teacher and not attack back. By handling the situation in this way, I obtain some measure of peace. On the level of content, I can see them as the Son of God and equal with me in that sense. I know that they are acting from their ego and I do not wish them any harm, but I do not wish to interact with them on a personal level. Or would it see me as doing my best on the level of form but still seeing myself as joined with these people on the level of content, so that I will be able to join with God as one with the Sonship. A: The level of content is the only level of relevance from the perspective of A Course in Miracles. Thus, the issue is not whether to be with people or not to be with them, but to be without judgment of them. This is the point that Jesus stressed with Helen in one of his discussions with her. He told her that her concern should not be for what words she should say to people, but rather that she ask for help to see each person \"through the eyes of truth and not of judgment.\" Then, Jesus concluded, \"the help of God and all His angels will respond\" (Absence",
    "output": "from Felicity, p. 381). Judgment interferes with the flow of love through our minds; and therefore if we let go of judgment, we will automatically do and say whatever is most loving, which is Jesus' meaning in saying \"the help of God and all His angels will respond.\" The idea, thus, is to look within to see if you have any investment in seeing your co-workers as the \"bad ones\" (which makes you the \"good one\"). Once free of that type of investment, you would be peaceful in interacting with them or not interacting with them on a personal level. It would no longer be an issue for you. Some people make the mistake of thinking that love would automatically direct you to associate with another person regardless of the circumstances--that that would always be the loving thing to do. That is not true. Perhaps interacting on a personal level would not be the loving thing to do. The point of this principle is that the behavioral should-I-or-shouldn't-I conflict would simply vanish in the holy instant of being without judgment."

    "text_input": "Q #1294: I think I have a fairly good understanding of what A Course in Miracles is about. However, I get stuck! I have things that I want in my life; as an example, an intimate relationship with the opposite sex. I often catch myself wondering, though, is this something that I should pray for? The Course says that you are not to seek outside yourself (T-29.VII). Since I haven't found this intimate relationship, I wonder if this is the Holy Spirit's way of telling me I'm not ready, or is it my evil ego keeping me in its grip? I guess my biggest question is, what am I failing to see? I realize that I am to find happiness and all the love I need with God, but the fact is, I think I'm here and I want to have this relationship while I am here. What things do I need to look at to uncover why this isn't happening for me? A: The Course does not really address the issue of why we do not get what we want in this world, as its purpose is to help us realize this is not our home and nothing here can ever give us the peace of God--nor can anything here take it away from us. The Course would definitely not say, though, that your not getting what you want means that the Holy Spirit is trying to tell you something--that you are not ready for a relationship, for instance. It is a mistake to conceive of the Holy Spirit as interacting with us in that way--He does not send us lessons or control the specifics of our lives. (#628 discusses the nature of prayer in relation to the Holy Spirit.) People are always wondering what they are doing wrong because they are unable to get a good job, make more money, have children, etc., even though they are doing everything \"right\" in terms of the world. Sometimes it's just circumstances; sometimes it's an unconscious conflict-- e.g., wanting something but also feeling unworthy of happiness, success, etc.; wanting something yet feeling you are failing the Course because it is against specialness, etc. But, without denying the responsibilities we have in our roles in the world, our focus should shift from why we are not getting what we want, to the underlying self-concept we have accepted that makes lack and inadequacy real, and then causes us to orient our striving toward solving these problems of lack and inadequacy, thinking we know what is in our best interests. What the Course does is urge us to think carefully about what we are really asking for, but this refers exclusively to the content in our minds--whether we are asking for what will keep us in the dream or help us awaken from the dream; whether we are seeing our interests as the same or separate from others. The bottom line is always purpose --what purpose will this relationship serve? And honesty about that is most important. It is not wrong to want a relationship with a",
    "output": "person of the opposite sex, and the Course never says not to pursue one (see Questions #184 and #312). It just asks that we be clear about the purpose in our mind. Even if you are clear that it is all about specialness and bodies being together, you need not feel guilty or be hard on yourself. Since there is no hierarchy of illusions, pursuing a special relationship is no different from doing everything you can to insure a supply of clean air to breathe or healthful food to eat. It is normal in this world to do that. We need only remember that every aspect of our lives can be treated as a classroom into which we invite the Holy Spirit to help us transform our relationships so that they will serve not the ego's purpose of separation but His purpose of getting us beyond specialness to the perception of shared interests and a shared Self."

    "text_input": "Q #1295: Traditional psychotherapy and A Course in Miracles seem to define the term ego in different ways. I've been in counseling for about the past two years and my therapist is working with me to build an ego. She tells me that I've got to get an ego first before I can give it up. It would seem that what she defines as ego and what Jesus is talking about are two different things, but I'm not completely sure just how to sort them out. A: Counselors and therapists use the term ego thanks to Sigmund Freud. Freud divided the human personality into three parts: id, ego, and superego. According to his theory, the id operates on the pleasure principle, seeking immediate gratification for our instinctual drives. The superego is our internal, moral censor that represses the id. And the ego mediates between the id, superego, and the outside world, seeking to find means for us to express ourselves in socially acceptable ways. The ego is the conscious part of the psyche--basically the personality with which we identify. Today's counselors who speak of the ego do not necessarily view the psyche from a Freudian perspective. But they have largely adopted the word ego as a shortcut for saying our personality and identity as an individual. The goal of most counselors is to assist others in becoming healthier individuals--helping them to be more comfortable and functional within this world. So, we could say that they are helping their clients or patients to develop healthy egos.",
    "output": "When Jesus speaks of the ego in the Course, he is basically talking about the entire human psyche, conscious and unconscious. He tells us that the person we think we are is a false self, born of our mistaken belief that we could create a substitute for our true identity as God's beloved Son. Thus, A Course in Miracles is all about recognizing that we would be happier if we released our grip on the ego and embraced the Holy Spirit instead. Therefore, for many Course students, the term ego has taken on a sinister ring--making the idea of developing a healthy one sound contradictory, if not downright frightening. However, this is the result of a misunderstanding. The Course encourages us to live in this world but know we are not of it. And doing that requires ego strength. To not develop a healthy ego represents fear, which must be unlearned if we are ever to move beyond fear to acceptance of God's Love. So, far from turning the ego into an enemy, Jesus would have us forgive it (and thus forgive ourselves) as the first step to moving beyond it. While he would ultimately have us let the ego go; Jesus would be the first to agree that we cannot move beyond the ego until we see it for what it is and make peace with it. Thus, like a great therapist, he asks us to simply watch it--turning our experience of being an ego (which, within this dream, seems to be the entirety of who we are) into a classroom in which we learn more and more about ourselves every day. The Course and most forms of counseling do part ways in that, in counseling, becoming at peace with yourself within this world is typically the final goal, while in the Course, it is only a step toward awakening. Yet, despite both this fundamental difference and differences in the use of language, there is certainly no inherent conflict between the Course and the process of therapy. It is simply important for Course students to hold the aim of therapy as a means to an end and not an end itself."

    "text_input": "Q #1296: If the split mind (A=B+C) is illusory, is the right mind the capital M Mind?",
    "output": "The split mind refers to the separated Son's mind divided into the ego (wrong-minded) part and the Holy Spirit (right-minded) part. The A=B+C diagram refers to the wrong mind, A representing the concept of the sinful self which gets split off into self B (innocent victim) and self C (sinful victimizer), both B and C being experienced on the bodily level. The correction of this ego dynamic of splitting off our sense of sinfulness is what is known as the right mind, which is also diagrammed as A', B', C' (A prime, B prime, C prime). As part of the split mind, therefore, the right mind is still within the illusion. The capital M Mind is only in Heaven. We can say that in our right mind we are reflecting the capital M Mind, but as the correction of the wrong mind, the right mind exists only within the illusory realm of separation. When we awaken in God, there no longer is a right or wrong mind. An expanded explanation, with charts, of this dynamic is given in All Are Called, Vol. One of Ken's The Message of A Course in Miracles.

    "text_input": "Q #1297: I was sitting in the library one evening and I noticed a certain book glowing. There was just something about it that made me know I needed to read it. So I took the random book and it turned out to be A Course in Miracles. I've spent much time over the last six years not only studying the Course but also other spiritualities, philosophies, and thought systems. I have reached the conclusion that nothing in this universe actually exists except the minds of the people. I absolutely do not believe in matter! I believe if we had mass consciousness believing along the same lines, this entire world as we see it would disappear and the Sonship would become reunited. Don't get me wrong though, I do believe that all works of good that a fellow brother does for another will be remembered for eternity in God's Mind, but everything else will be erased when full Atonement is achieved. Until the majority of the Sonship has realized this, we are bound to this illusion of matter; so the question remains: How do we convince people in such a materialistic world that matter doesn't matter? How do we convince people who put so much faith in their bodies that their bodies are illusions? And for those of us who understand these things, how do we live in an illusory world recognizing the absurdness of it all and pay attention to the illusion to some extent; i.e., not getting run over by cars, walking naked down the highway, etc.? Because it sounds as if the more we \"play\" in the illusion, the more strength we are adding to that illusion as well. I firmly believe that this is the next logical evolutionary progression of the Course. What do you think of what I consider to be the \"Evolution of A Course in Miracles.\" A: A Course in Miracles clearly teaches that the world and the body are illusory, and that the world will disappear into the nothingness from which it came when we no longer want the",
    "output": "purpose it serves. \"When not one thought of sin remains, the world is over. It will not be destroyed nor attacked nor even touched. It will merely cease to seem to be\" (M-14.2:10-12; see also T-20.VIII.7-11; W-pII.226). The world, thus, is not the problem, as it is nothing but a projection of the mind, \"the outside picture of an inward condition\" (T-21.in.1:5). The Course therefore teaches us to look within at what is causing us to project outward and identify with the form the projection takes. That is the core of its teaching and mind-training exercises. Early in the text Jesus talks about the difficulty of getting through to us: \"How can you teach someone the value of something he has deliberately thrown away? He must have thrown it away because he did not value it. You can only show him how miserable he is without it, and slowly bring it nearer so he can learn how his misery lessens as he approaches it. This teaches him to associate his misery with its absence, and the opposite of misery with its presence. It gradually becomes desirable as he changes his mind about its worth. I am teaching you to associate misery with the ego and joy with the spirit. You have taught yourself the opposite. You are still free to choose, but can you really want the rewards of the ego in the presence of the rewards of God?\" (T-4.VI.5) The pedagogy of this course is well thought out--it meets us where we are and respects the choices we have made to dissociate ourselves from truth and love, while at the same time it shows us the disastrous consequences of those choices. It is never coercive or threatening, however, just abundantly clear about the mess we have made of everything, including our self- identity, why we have done it, and how to undo it all. Its approach is gentle and encouraging, reassuring us that there is no urgency, as ultimately time is unreal and we are undoing what never happened (the principle of the Atonement). Everything we need to restore to our minds the awareness of love's presence is already in the Course. For those for whom this course resonates, nothing more is needed. Other paths are available to those who are not comfortable with this one (M-1.4:1-2). The Course often addresses the concern, to use your words, of how to \"live in an illusory world recognizing the absurdness of it all and pay attention to the illusion to some extent; i.e., not getting run over by cars, walking naked down the highway, etc.\" Lesson 155 teaches us, for example, that \"there is a way of living in the world that is not here, although it seems to be. You do not change appearance, though you smile more frequently. Your forehead is serene; your eyes are quiet. And the ones who walk the world as you do recognize their own. Yet those who have not yet perceived the way will recognize you also, and believe that you are like them, as you were before\" (W-pI.155.1). There is also a section in the manual for teachers that discusses this aspect of our process: \"How Should the Teacher of God Spend His Day?\" (M-16). The main point is that a mind identified with love would appear to others in a form that could be accepted without fear and to which others could relate in a normal way. The mind's purpose or content is the key factor, not the behavior. Many Gnostics deliberately disobeyed the world's laws to prove that the world is not real. Well, by fighting against the world, they proved just the opposite. If you are clear about the difference between form (behavior) and content (mind), you would be able to live in the world and abide by its rules without reinforcing the illusion in your mind. \"The body was not made by love. Yet love does not condemn it and can use it lovingly, respecting what the Son of God has made and using it to save him from illusions\" (T-18.VI.4:7- 8). (Kenneth presents a detailed examination of this confusion as found in Gnosticism, the ascetic traditions, and other approaches in two of his books: Love Does Not Condemn: The World, the Flesh, and the Devil According to Platonism, Christianity, Gnosticism and A Course in Miracles and The Message of A Course in Miracles--Vol. 1: All Are Called; Vol. 2: Few Choose to Listen. He shows how the Course avoids the pitfalls of different moral traditions, leading to a formulation of a non-normative or new morality.) A Course in Miracles surely is not the final word in spirituality, as it is directed to those on the bottom rungs of the spiritual ladder (i.e., all of us); but for those of us who have accepted it as our path home, it is more than sufficient, which is why Jesus says at the end of the 365 lessons of the workbook, \"This course is a beginning, not an end\" (W-ep.1:1). We spend the rest of our lives applying its teachings to our personal lives. We needn't try to convince others to change how they go about their lives. Our focus is exclusively on how we choose to perceive others and the world: \"Therefore, seek not to change the world, but choose to change your mind about the world\" (T-21.in.1:7). Our only responsibility is to accept the Atonement for ourselves (T- 2.V.5:1). If I do that, then I know everyone has done it, because the Sonship is one. As long as I believe that others still have to do it, my mind is not yet healed, because I am still perceiving the Sonship as fragmented. This is a major difference between the Course's teaching and your belief that \"if we had mass consciousness believing along the same lines, this entire world as we see it would disappear and the Sonship would become reunited.\" If this were true, there would be actual parts of the Sonship, and some would be victims of others because these others still choose to remain separate. That is decidedly different from the entire thrust of Jesus' teaching in the Course. One further thought about A Course in Miracles and its \"evolution\": It is impossible for a brain/ mind as limited as ours to fully understand this course, which comes from a mind that transcends time and space entirely and is without limit. That, again, is why the Course teaches that our only responsibility is to accept the Atonement for ourselves. Finally, there is a lovely passage--seems more like a song Jesus is singing--that blends with your belief that \"all works of good that a fellow brother does for another will be remembered for eternity in God's Mind\"; we quote in part: \"How can you who are so holy suffer? All your past except its beauty is gone; and nothing is left but a blessing. I have saved all your kindnesses and every loving thought you ever had. I have purified them of the errors that hid their light, and kept them for you in their own perfect radiance. They are beyond destruction and beyond guilt. They come from the Holy Spirit within you, and we know what God creates is eternal\" (T-5.IV.8:1-6)."

    "text_input": "Q #1298: Can you please help shed some light on why the guilt seems to be so intense in dealing with parents? For example, I realize now that I keep the relationship going in form because of the intense guilt I experience if I don't visit them.What could the \"sin\" be, from a metaphysical perspective, that causes the guilt, and why is it such a sin within the ego system to end the relationship with parents in form?",
    "output": "The \"sin\" leading to the intense guilt in parent-child relationships is rooted in the ego's master plan to replace God with itself. As a result of our mind's choice to identify with the ego, we no longer experience our relationship with our true Source; instead, we substitute for that another self that then becomes totally dependent on human parents or the equivalent. The root of our guilt, thus, is our belief (now concealed from our awareness) that we have thrown God away and made a substitute for our true Identity as His creation, forever one with Him. We have proclaimed that we do not need God and can get all of our needs met through this new relationship of parent and child, the paradigm of all other special relationships in the world. Specialness always entails guilt, and therefore if the relationship never gets beyond specialness (neediness, dependency, expectations, etc.), the guilt will continue to be a major factor. This would be true of any relationship with authority figures: boss, teacher, political figure, hero, etc. Kenneth's two-part book, Parents and Children: Our Most Difficult Classroom, discusses a wide variety of issues flowing from this most basic relationship, from the perspective of both parent and child. One salient discussion, directly related to your question, pertains to Freud's insight: \"The liberation of an individual, as he grows up, from the authority of his parents is one of the most necessary though one of the most painful results brought about by the course of his development.\" The key to successfully transcending the specialness aspect is distinguishing between form and content. Liberation from authority is a content issue; i.e., you can be living with your parents (the form) and be liberated from or bound to their authority (the content). Greatly abbreviating what really requires a lengthy explanation, you would gradually come to relate to them not as parents, but as Sons of God sharing with you and everyone else the same journey back to God. They have the same pain and anguish in their wrong minds, the same healing and peace in their right minds, and the same power to decide between the two as do you and everyone else. You would then recognize that the guilt in your relationship with your parents is a reflection of your guilt over having rejected God and accepted a substitute for this one and only real relationship. Then you would automatically know what to do on the level of form: you would remain faithful to the form (parent-child) and be appropriate, kind, and responsible, but you would do it all differently (the content)."

    "text_input": "Q #1299: The sections of A Course in Miracles titled The Agreement to Join (T-28.III) and The Greater Joining (T-28.IV) seem very important with respect to practically dealing with \"others\" and our perceptions of them, and therefore our perceptions of ourselves. However, I am unclear as to the practical application of their meaning. Take, for example, the statement, \"Uniting with a brother's mind prevents the cause of sickness and perceived effects\" (T-28.III.2:5). If I see a brother who is sick (in whatever form that may take), I know that I have joined him in that illusion. But what is it that I am to see, look for, become aware of, etc., in order to prove him and myself wrong in this perception? A: Discussing practical applications of Course principles is always tricky. On one hand, the Course is very practical because it tells us exactly how to follow its teachings. On the other hand, when most of us think of practical applications, we envision something we can do behaviorally. But the Course is never about behavior. Thus, to answer your question, there is nothing you are supposed to see, look for, or become aware of externally. How could there be when the Course's overarching message is that there is nothing external to your own mind? And the Course certainly does not ask you to prove your perceptions or those of your brother wrong. What, then, is it telling us to do? We can begin to answer this by carefully reading the very sentence you referred to. \"Uniting with a brother's mind prevents the cause of sickness and",
    "output": "perceived effects\" (T-28.III.2:5; italics ours). In other words, we are asked to join on the level of mind. Jesus says nothing about joining as bodies or doing anything on the level of form. Obviously, a body cannot join with a mind. Clearly, this has to mean that the place in which we join our brother is in our thoughts. This prevents the cause of sickness. It does this because the cause of sickness is our belief in guilt and separation. Therefore, by recognizing in our own mind that guilt and separation are illusory and that we are united with our brother--both in our sense of guilt within this dream and as God's beloved Son in reality--we disarm the guilt and fear that caused the need for sickness as a potent defense against the truth within this dream. This does not mean that our internal shift will heal either our brother's body or our own. However, it does mean that if we fully made this shift, we could have a body filled with cancer and still be at peace. Likewise, we could be with a brother who is dying of cancer and know that the disease has no effect on the reality of who he is. From that place, we would see that while his body appears to be sick, he is not a body and therefore he is not sick. Behaviorally, we would probably still do all the loving things one normally does for another who is experiencing pain. We would not try to make the sickness go away or tell the person that it was illusory. If the person were ready to accept that, he would not be sick. For this reason, we would instead comfort the person in whatever way would be most helpful to him in the moment. Another key to grasping what the Course is getting at in the sections you mentioned is the realization that when Jesus talks about sickness, he does not mean a physical ailment in the body. To Jesus, simply thinking that we are here is sick. Believing that we need to breathe, eat, sleep, and so forth is an illness --not because these things are bad, but because they represent our clearly insane choice to believe that we could be limited by this \"wall of flesh around the mind, keeping it prisoner in a tiny spot of space and time, beholden unto death, and given but an instant in which to sigh and grieve and die\" (T-20.VI.11:2). From Jesus' healed perspective then, your need to breathe is no more or less a sickness than your brother's cancer. This is why \"Accepting the Atonement for yourself means not to give support to someone's dream of sickness and of death\" (T-28.IV.1:1). Accepting the Atonement means recognizing that the entirety of our experience is but a bad dream of sickness and of death, and this is true whether the body currently appears to be what the world would label as healthy or ill. Fortunately, Jesus does not ask us to make this dramatic shift in our thinking on our own. He lets us know that the Holy Spirit is already in our mind, ready to help us change our thoughts whenever we ask Him to. Again, you do not have to try to look for or prove anything. \"Your willingness to let illusions go is all the Healer of God's Son requires\" (T-28.IV.10:8)."

    "output": "No, it does not lead to special love. According to A Course in Miracles, both sickness and healing are exclusively in the mind; and sickness is an attack, a decision to reject the love in our right mind and identify instead with separation and guilt in our wrong mind, which we then project. To love yourself simply means to accept the truth about yourself, thus healing yourself of all false thoughts about who you are. In that state, you would not and could not attack yourself or anyone else. This is not special love because this right-minded self-love, by definition, includes everyone else as well. The love in our right minds is all-inclusive, unlike the special love made by the ego that excludes certain people or groups. This is a love that is really self-less; it is the stage of the journey that precedes our return to the perfect Oneness of God's Love for His Son, and His Son's for Him."

    "output": "In the context of the two paragraphs that precede this passage, Jesus is saying that we were wrong in believing that attack is our reality and that our destruction is the final proof that we were right. In other words, we were wrong about everything we believed. So he is saying that we should really want to be wrong--to be glad we have been wrong--because our identification with the ego has led only to unhappiness and hopelessness. Recall the question he asks us later in the text of A Course in Miracles: \"Do you prefer that you be right or happy?\" (T-29.VII.1:9). It is the same idea--we should be glad that we have been totally wrong about ourselves and reality, and happily accept the truth that we have been denying."

    "text_input": "Q #1302: When I shut the doors, confine myself in a room, and immerse myself in reading A Course in Miracles, I feel such elation because everything it says rings true. I literally wish that when I open the doors, the illusory world would not exist anymore. This brings instantaneous fear and anxiety, of course. I sometimes picture the \"cunning\" ego asserting specialness, as if mocking me to say \"see, God does not really love you; you're stuck here.\" I get so confused and sad, I just weep as I always have. It seems as if there is a constant battle raging inside me, and peace, even when it comes, is fleeting. It seems as if I have to remember to \"choose once again\" constantly and unrelentingly. When all is said and done, I truly want only God. I also honestly believe that God waits for me. But why the seeming distance and the muck that shields the light? A: Yes, other students have these kinds of experiences--they are not uncommon at all. Patience and gentleness are essential in working through this process. If we could simply accept the peace of God without reservation the first time we open our minds to it, we would not need A Course in Miracles; and, indeed, we probably would not even be here. It is perhaps far more helpful and realistic to assume that we don't really want it--or, that we want it only on our terms--because we are terrified of what it would mean to fully accept it. Deep down we realize that our identity as we know it would disappear, as would the world. We thus are highly conflicted--we both desperately want peace, yet are terrified of accepting it. We think it would be the most wonderful thing ever to awaken from this burdensome dream of suffering, yet we are not sure we want to let go of our identity as a self. This is the theme Jesus discusses in \"The Fear of Redemption\" (T- 13.III), and it is also the subject of Kenneth's recent book, Ending Our Resistance to Love. However, Jesus reassures us of the gentleness of the journey on which he is leading us: \"[we] will first dream of peace, and then awaken to it\" (T-13.VII.9:1); and we will not be \"abruptly lifted up and hurled into reality\" (T-16.VI.8:1). It certainly does seem as if a battle is being waged in our minds, but this is true only from the ego's vantage point. (Note the section in the text called \"Above the Battleground\" [T-23.IV]) The ego senses a mortal threat to its existence, and that threat is our mind's power to decide against the ego and for the Holy Spirit's thought system of forgiveness. To make this choice is the beginning of the end of the ego, which is why it devised its strategy to shield us from our",
    "output": "identities as decision-making minds. Thus, for the ego there is definitely a life-and-death struggle, because both sides are real in its eyes. This is the tension we cannot help feeling when we identify with the ego. From Jesus vantage point, however, there is no battle, for he knows that the ego and everything it stands for is made up--you cannot do battle with something that does not exist, unless you're Don Quixote! Asking our questions--what is the ego and where can it found?--Jesus answers: \"Nothing and nowhere\" (C-2.6:7). Jesus thus guides us on our journey back into our minds where we can get in touch with our erroneous beliefs and then choose against them. But because we think we are bodies living in a world and are no longer aware of our identity as minds with the power of choice, Jesus starts us off on that level and uses our experiences in the world to lead us back to the content in our minds, and eventually back to our identity as minds. He teaches us how to treat our reactions to the goings-on in our daily lives as reflections of the contents we have chosen to make real in our minds: \"the outside picture of an inward condition\" (T-21.in.1:5). That is why our interactions are important--they constitute the curriculum Jesus can use as our teacher. This is A Course in Miracles' distinctive path. If you retreat from the world out of fear, ultimately it is because you have given the world a power it does not really have, forgetting that it is a projection of your mind (part of the ego's strategy) and that you therefore have given it the only meaning it has--a major principle in all of the Course's teachings (in addition to the reference to Chapter 21 above, see also T-13.IX.3:1 and W-pI.2). Succumbing to the ego's threats about the danger of remaining in your mind, you are overlooking the real strength that is still there. Depression is one of the consequences of taking the ego seriously. To choose the ego is to deny truth, separate yourself from the source of true peace and happiness, and have it appear that you are just a helpless victim of forces beyond your control. Jesus' teaching objective, thus, is to lead us back within to the place where we make the choice to believe in his truth or to deny it. His method takes into consideration our unfortunate condition of not even realizing there is a \"within\" to which we can return. This, again, points to the value of our interactions in the world--we can now learn to focus on their purpose (content) while still acting responsibly in our roles (form): \"Forget not that the healing of God's Son is all the world is for. That is the only purpose the Holy Spirit sees in it, and thus the only one it has\" (T-24.VI.4:1-2). This is where our hope lies, upheld by Jesus' promise to be with us each step of the way, and by his guarantee that we cannot fail, for all that we are doing is denying our denial of truth (T-12.II.1:5), and remembering what we chose to forget."

Recently, before falling asleep I was thinking about how much \"I want to be love,\" and I was woken out of a doze by a formless voice/roaring that was as powerful as the whole universe, and it nearly vibrated me apart. It happened several times. I really didn't know what to make of these experiences, so I forgave them, telling myself that God would do nothing to cause me pain. I wonder whether this is a stage on my spiritual path that will eventually pass. Can you help me make sense of this, as I want to do my part in healing the mind.",
    "output": "Speaking in general, one can say that the Voice of the Holy Spirit is always quiet, gentle, and peaceful; and therefore disquieting experiences would always be from the ego. The intensity of such experiences would reflect the intensity of one's fear and resistance. We all have tremendous fear of awakening from the dream, but it is almost totally unconscious. Our decision to study A Course in Miracles symbolizes our choice to awaken and to let go of the ego as our teacher; but our fear does not suddenly evaporate because of this decision (although in principle it could). The defensive shields that were protecting us from our fear begin to weaken and then the fear starts to rise to the surface, taking various forms and in varying degrees of intensity. We decided to bury it and then keep it buried because we experienced it as overwhelming, having chosen to listen to the ego's warnings that we would be brutally punished and then destroyed if we ever turned back and asked God to accept us back. The idea is to learn that the only power fear has is what we have given it, although we have no awareness of having made it. It is simply the result of our having identified with the ego and then forgetting we have a mind with the power to reverse that decision. We must respect the depth of this fear; yet, we needn't deny it, run from it, or confront it as though it were an enemy to be defeated. We just need to remember to be gentle with ourselves, and be sure to take whatever behavioral steps we can to alleviate the anxiety when it starts to overwhelm us. Looking at it with Jesus is the way we begin to let go of our belief in its reality."

    "text_input": "Q #1304: I know that A Course in Miracles is only concerned with the mind (cause). I seem to be getting the message that I should not ask Jesus for help making decisions concerning what external decisions may facilitate clearer thought. For example, I get caught up in the idea that my very physical job works against clear thought and consistent practice. Should I be solely concerned with forgiveness and let the physical world take care of itself? Or, is it appropriate to make physical changes that may put me in a better physical state to more clearly see my attack thoughts/forgiveness needs? A: A Course in Miracles does not tell us that physical changes are wrong. It does tell us, though, that we do not need to make external changes to change our mind. We could see our attack thoughts and forgiveness needs even if we were nailed to a cross or in a concentration camp. This is why Jesus says: \"Change does not mean anything at the symptom level, where it cannot work ... You should ask ... for help in the conditions that have brought the fear about. These conditions always entail a willingness to be separate\" (T-2.VI.3:7; T-2.VI.4:3-4). In other words, our pain comes not from anything external but rather from the fear and guilt engendered by our belief that we are separate from God and His Love. For this reason, we cannot expect external changes to change us internally. However, it will help us to change internally if every time we are tempted to make an external change, we first ask for help getting to an internal place of love and forgiveness. This is why the Course never says that there is any type of decision for which it is wrong to ask Jesus for help. Indeed, the Course's stance on decision making is summed up in the following passage: \" ... you cannot make decisions by yourself. The only question really is with what you choose to make them ... You will not make decisions by yourself whatever you decide. For they are made with idols or with God. And you ask help of anti-Christ or Christ, and which you choose will join with you and tell you what to do\" (T-30.I.14:3-4,7-9). Thus, whenever we make a decision, we listen to an internal",
    "output": "teacher in our mind. The choice is whether we listen to the ego or the Holy Spirit. Therefore, it is always a good idea to ask Jesus or the Holy Spirit for help. Where we must be careful, however, is in making sure that we are actually asking for help rather than simply requesting confirmation of a decision we have already made. For example, you do not want to decide that your job is the source of your unhappiness and then ask Jesus what to do about it. It would be far more productive to simply bring your unhappiness to Jesus and ask him to help you look at it through his nonjudgmental eyes. Let him reveal to you what internal shift needs to happen so that you no longer feel that external circumstances can rob you of the peace and Love of God. When you do that, you will automatically make decisions that reflect the love in your mind. Then, if you do make any external changes, they will be based solely on simple preferences and will not be difficult."

    "text_input": "Q #1305: I know the Course says sickness is a defense against the truth and that you shouldn't feel sorry for someone who is sick--that that depreciates the power of the person's mind. I am having such difficulty learning this lesson. How does one learn the lesson when her daughter has a serious chronic illness, an illness that causes pain and prevents the person from living a \"normal life\"? Nearly every day my daughter suffers and I suffer with her. I know this doesn't help her or me, but it's not been something I can change my mind about. I pray for help for her (and me) and my friends pray and then I learn, in The Song of Prayer that prayer doesn't help either. God doesn't even know we're here. Prayer is only for oneself, etc. What can I do? How can I change my mind and not see my sick, suffering daughter? This has been going on literally for years and I sure need some help, please. A: It is hard to imagine a more potent emotional trigger than watching your daughter suffer on a daily basis and being unable to do anything to alleviate it. The fact that her pain causes you pain is a very normal reaction. The purpose of A Course in Miracles is not to make you feel guilty or wrong for having this reaction. Nor should you feel that you are hurting her by having it. The Course does say that sickness is a defense against the truth (W-pI.136). But it would make the same claim about absolutely every aspect of our apparent existence and human experience. Breathing is a defense against the truth, thinking is a defense against the truth, speaking is a defense against the truth, and so on. This is so because believing that we are here is a defense against the truth. Yet, we all believe that we are here. And as long as we do, we cannot pick one element of our seeming existence, such as sickness, and convince ourselves that it is unreal. Unfortunately, the fear most of us have of illness often tempts Course students to do just that-- seeking to know that illness is an illusion, while still believing in other parts of this dream. From Jesus' healed perspective, desperately trying to let go of our belief in sickness makes no more sense than desperately trying to stop breathing. To him, neither of these is real and neither is something to feel guilty about. Because we all choose the scripts of our lives on a level of the mind that we are not aware of-- outside of this dream of time and space--we cannot know why we or others experience particular life events such as chronic illnesses. And we cannot will illness away or easily break the emotional hold it has on us. But the Course does tell us what we can do:",
    "output": "\"Perceive in sickness but another call for love, and offer your brother what he believes he cannot offer himself. Whatever the sickness, there is but one remedy. You will be made whole as you make whole, for to perceive in sickness the appeal for health is to recognize in hatred the call for love. And to give a brother what he really wants is to offer it unto yourself, for your Father wills you to know your brother as yourself. Answer his call for love, and yours is answered\" (T- 12.II.3:1-5). In other words, your daughter's pain and the pain you feel because of it are the same in content. You both feel victimized by something you cannot control, which seems to make it impossible to experience the Love and peace of God. So the way you can truly help your daughter is to allow your own call for love to be answered. Although, as you stated, God does not know about this dream world and thus cannot answer our prayers by directing the external events in our lives, help is available. We access it by asking the Holy Spirit (the memory of God's Love in our mind) to help us look at the events in our lives through His eyes. When we do this, we see that nothing makes it impossible for us to experience the Love of God because His Love is in us. And once you get in touch with this Love, you will see that though your daughter's body is sick and suffering, this has no effect on her own ability to feel God's Love. She may not realize this and you may still have strong feelings about her pain, but you will know that your only job is to watch the situation with loving eyes and continually ask for guidance to do the loving thing, whatever it may be. Ultimately, whether our body appears to be healthy or sick, whether our life is one that the world judges as pleasant or miserable, we are all on the same journey. We all have the same opportunity to use our life as a classroom or a prison. Each of us can make the choice at any moment to drop the ego's hand, releasing our grip on this illusory world of pain, and take the Holy Spirit's hand instead, which gently awakens us and lifts us back into our true home in Heaven. You can only make this choice for yourself, but in so doing, you light the way for others. So, during challenging moments with your daughter, do not feel bad about your thoughts or emotions and do not try to change them. Simply ask the Holy Spirit to help you remember that a happy end is assured for both your journeys. Let Him remind you that though your daughter may face many challenges, God's Love surrounds her and she will never be left comfortless (W- ep.6:6-7)."

    "text_input": "Q #1306: I have been studying A Course in Miracles for seven years, and my mind has changed for sure! Now I would like to ask your opinion about a situation that is causing conflict in my life. I fired my maid, who had been working for me for nine years, when I discovered that she had been stealing money from me. I feel at peace about what I did, and I don't feel any anger toward her. I am still in touch with her, but feel that I cannot trust her enough to give her a job in my house again. A professional colleague told me that by firing the maid, I did the opposite of what A Course in Miracles teaches--a few other Course students agreed with that. But I still feel that I did the right thing, and feel peaceful about it. A: From the Course's perspective, the issue is not about the behavior of firing your maid. Firing an employee is neither loving nor unloving in itself. Only the content in your mind determines whether it is loving or not, which means you can be motivated by the ego or the Holy Spirit.",
    "output": "With your ego, you would perceive yourself as the victim and your maid as the victimizer, and therefore you would feel justified in being angry and punitive. With the Holy Spirit, you would not perceive a victim and a victimizer; and therefore the love in your right mind would direct you to do whatever is best for both of you in that situation. That could mean firing her or not firing her; but there would be no hatred, anger, guilt, or fear. You would feel peaceful. There is nothing wrong in recognizing another person's ego at work and then limiting that person's ability to act it out. You would not hire a known pedophile to stay with your children while you were away; but that does not mean you would not see him as a Son of God with the same right mind, wrong mind, and decision maker that you have. It is just common sense not to allow him to stay with your children while you are not there. Similarly, if you served on a jury, you could be motivated by love to vote \"guilty,\" which could result in the defendant going to jail for a very long time. Again, you would see the judge, the defendant, and the person bringing the charges as part of the Sonship with you--no hatred, no anger, no one or the other. It is a serious mistake to think that forgiveness means that you must keep a dishonest person on your staff, have a pedophile take care of your children, or never vote \"guilty\" on a jury. Without realizing it, many Course students are saying there is a hierarchy of illusions--that some things and behaviors are always holy or spiritual and others are always unholy or unspiritual. How can that be, though, if everything here is illusory? One part of an illusion cannot be better or worse than another. The very first lesson in the workbook points us in that direction: \"Nothing I see in this room ... means anything\" (W-pI.1). Jesus is training us to focus on the choices we are making in our minds rather than on the external behavior; and he wants us to learn also that there are only two choices we can ever make: to believe that our existence as separate from God is real, or that that is just a mistaken belief that we can now correct through the practice of forgiveness. All of the interactions in our lives, then, can reflect back to us which of these choice we have made. That is the only meaningful part of our lives here."

    "output": "This may or may not occur, but that would not be of concern to the mind that lets go of guilt through forgiveness. As you progress with forgiveness, in other words, you would realize that the guilt in your mind was the source of your pain, not external events and situations, however horrendous they may be on the level of the world. This perhaps is the most difficult of lessons for us to learn, but it is one of the defining features of A Course in Miracles that teaches us how to be fully present to our roles in the world while learning that our perception of them (our internal experience) comes directly from the choice we are making in our mind to identify with either the ego or the Holy Spirit (or Jesus). Sometimes there are external changes as well as the internal shifts in how we perceive the external. For example, if as a result of guilt we feel deeply unworthy of happiness and love, our unconscious need to punish ourselves will find its way into our interactions, possibly leading to one unhappy experience after another. Therefore, when we bring the guilt in our mind to the love of Jesus, also in our mind, we will be letting go of our need to remain unhappy, even though we were not consciously aware of that dynamic in our thinking. When that need no longer prevails, we obviously would make better choices in the world, as we would be walking Jesus' path of gentleness and kindness, and thus be less self-destructive, etc. The important point to keep in mind always is that the form (external situations) does not necessarily demonstrate the mind's chosen content. Thus, being in a painful relationship does not automatically mean that it comes from guilt. We cannot make a judgment based solely on appearances (form). This issue has been the topic of several other discussions. You might wish to look at the following Questions, which provide many Course references: #350, #542, #660, #846, #873, and #987."

The Course does not seem to advocate \"Embracing What Is\"; rather, it seems to say that when negativity arises, to turn your attention away and seek the light. If this is correct, then the Course seems to be dualistic and rejects life as it appears. Sometimes when reading the Course I get this feeling that God created Reality and I created the false; but who created me that made the false? Isn't maya/illusion also God; and therefore shouldn't we embrace maya/illusion, the false self, too? It sometimes feels like the Course is setting up a dualism between body mind ego and spirit, when perhaps they are really one? A: A Course in Miracles is a strict non-dualism. It teaches that only the infinite realm of mind/ spirit is real. The source of our belief that the body and the world are also real is a thought we hold in our minds of selfishly wanting to exist apart from God. Thus, the Course teaches: \"The world was made as an attack on God. It symbolizes fear. And what is fear except love's absence? Thus the world was meant to be a place where God could enter not, and where His Son could be apart from Him\" (W-pII.3.2:1-4). This statement of the purpose that underlies the making of the world is a major difference between the Course and other traditions that also speak of the world as illusory. The world is not God. And the false self that made it is not God or of God. God creates only like Himself. Imperfection cannot from Him--another major difference between A Course in Miracles and other traditions. That is why the Atonement principle is at the heart of both its teachings and its practices. This principle states that separation from Totality is an impossibility, and therefore we are simply mistaken in our belief that we exist as separate individuals apart from God. This is a greatly abbreviated summary of the Course's non- dualism--all that our space allows here. Some other Questions may be helpful to you in providing additional insights: #6, #82, and #171. Perhaps the only similarity between the Course and \"Embracing What Is\" (if we understand that correctly) is that our perceptions and experiences can be used for the healing of our minds, even though they are the perceptions and experiences of a false self. Thus, Jesus says: \"The body was not made by love. Yet love does not condemn it and can use it lovingly, respecting what the Son of God has made and using it to save him from illusions\" (T-18.VI.4:7-8). The key to practicing this effectively is gradually learning to discern the purpose we have chosen in our minds, for that is always the reason we experience what we do (not that we are responsible for other people's choices); this also entails learning to distinguish between form (behavior) and content (mind). In this sense we can say that the Course clearly does not \"reject life\"--in fact, our daily interactions and feelings provide the very curriculum that our inner Teacher uses to help us get in touch with the contents in our minds that are the source of all our pain and conflict. In other words,  negativity is purposeful, and that is what the Course helps us get in touch with so that we can change a self-defeating purpose to one that will lead us out of the illusion entirely. (For some statements along these lines, see T-20.VIII.7-9; T-31.VII.12; W-pII.226.) In sum, then, the Course would never suggest that we turn away when negativity arises--just the opposite! Jesus asks that we look at it with him, as expressed in this passage from \"The 'Dynamics' of the Ego\": \"No one can escape from illusions unless he looks at them, for not looking is the way they are protected. There is no need to shrink from illusions, for they cannot be dangerous. We are ready to look more closely at the ego's thought system because together we have the lamp that will dispel it ... \" (T-11.V.1:1-3). Seeking the light, thus, symbolizes our choice to reverse our identification with the ego's thought system of separation and identify instead with the Holy Spirit's thought system of forgiveness. We deny our denial of the truth about ourselves, thus restoring to our awareness the true peace and love in which we were created. Q #1309 (The following three questions were submitted by the same person.)  (i): Ken Wapnick has suggested that when dealing with others, we behave \"normally,\" showing kindness the way \"normal\" people do. But if we come into the dream as egos, then isn't normal here always guilt, attack, and hate? If the ego is 100% hate and the Holy Spirit the expression of God's love, is it possible to be lead by the Holy Spirit or Jesus?",
    "output": "It is not quite accurate to say that we come into this dream as egos. We come into this dream as a result of listening to the ego. Therefore, we generally think we are the ego--a belief that is reflected in our conviction that we are an individual, in a body, having a physical experience that is separate from everyone else. This causes us to live according to the principle of separate interests, which asserts that you and I need different things in order to survive. More specifically, I need to get my physical and psychological needs met and you need to get yours met. The only interest I have in your needs is a constant fear that as you try to get them met, you will take something from me. As long as we listen to the ego, these will be the unconscious dynamics that drive our lives. Fortunately, A Course in Miracles lets us know that we do not have to listen to the ego. We could just as easily turn to the Holy Spirit as our internal Teacher. He will teach us that our needs are not separate because our very identities are entirely different than we ever imagined. He will gradually reveal to us that the person we think we are is but a puppet whose trials and tribulations have absolutely no impact on our reality as God's one Son. From that perspective, we will see that, appearances to the contrary, we have only one need, which we share with everyone: the need to awaken from this nightmare to our reality in Heaven where we can be at peace at last. Clearly then, we have two entirely opposing thought systems in our mind. When we listen to the ego, we are 100 percent hate. When we listen to the Holy Spirit, we are 100 percent love. Which teacher we choose is entirely up to us. Notice that this is all about what goes on internally. Ken's suggestion is to behave normally. This does not mean that our behavior should be hateful. It simply means that in terms of spiritual growth, behavior is not what we should focus on changing because it is not the source of the problem. When we change the content of our mind to love, our behavior will automatically reflect that. We will generally still say and do all the socially expected things that our roles require. For example, will still behave the way one needs to as a parent, spouse, employee, supervisor, neighbor, friend, and so forth. The only difference will be that our internal mantra of \"What's in it for me?\" will have been replaced by a sense of all inclusive love. Obviously this is likely to impact our actions at times, but how it does so is not our concern."

Does this mean that I should not censor my thoughts, or that I should open my thoughts to others even when they are not pure? A: What we as decision-making minds are \"guarding\" is the decision to see ourselves as innocent and helpless victims of a world we are sure is outside us: the world's thought system imposes itself on us; we are not its origin. We (as minds) are carefully protecting ourselves from any incursion into this heavily defended secret. This is the role Jesus is asking us to renounce. He wants us to be willing to open our minds to him, meaning being willing to go within and uncover what we have been hiding from ourselves and from him. In a later chapter he tells us that \"together we have the lamp that will dispel it [the ego thought system]\" (T-11.V.1:3). That really is the essence of our practice: to bring the darkness of the ego to the light of Jesus' love, where we will finally see there was only the illusion of darkness and therefore no need for defenses. And we can do this only when we are willing to look with Jesus at our investment in sustaining the ego thought system in our minds. That role of sustaining the ego thought system is what Jesus want us to give up in favor of our joining with him in all our thinking and perception.",

    "output": "Sorry about your confusion! The context of the statement--the point being made--should clarify its meaning. If the point being emphasized is that A Course in Miracles is about the hard work of looking at our ego and the terrible price we pay for choosing it, then one could underscore that by saying it is not simply a course on peace and love. In the same vein, many people just stay with all the \"nice\" parts of the Course and skip over all of the more threatening parts--the sometimes gory descriptions of guilt and specialness, for example. While it is not wrong to do that if that is all a person can handle, it is not what the Course is about; and to make that point one could again say that this is not a course on peace and love--reflecting this important principle: \"Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all of the barriers within yourself that you have built against it. It is not necessary to seek for what is true, but it is necessary to seek for what is false\" (T-16.IV.6:1-2). When might one say this is a course about peace and love? Well, you could be talking about how Course students fall into judgment, for example, or specialness. Thus, \"Here we have a course about peace and love, and yet its students go around ruthlessly hitting each other over the head with it.\" The point is that Jesus is teaching us to get beyond our self-centered approach to relationships and see instead that we all share the same interests; but then we wind up doing the exact opposite by using these very teachings to make ourselves spiritually superior to others, or to denounce those who fail to live up to them. In this context, again, one might say, \"Jesus has give us this wonderful course about peace and love, and people use it to exclude others from their peace and love.\""

Is it a different form of Heaven than the nondualistic oneness with God that is our natural state? A: Like many other questions that occur to students of A Course in Miracles, the question of what happens when we die is not one for which we can give a truly satisfying answer. This is because the question presupposes that something actually happens when we die, which in turn presupposes that we are actually here. From our perspective, within this dream of time and space, this is an entirely logical assumption. However, Jesus' message in the Course is that we are not here. We remain at home in Heaven, at one with God, merely dreaming that we are having a physical experience within a physical world.",
    "output": "Thus, from Jesus' healed perspective, nothing happens when we are born, nothing happens while we live, and nothing happens when we die. We could compare this to having sleeping dreams at night. Regardless of what seems to occur in your dreams, when you awaken in the morning you discover that you are still lying in your bed, and nothing has happened to you since you fell asleep. If the entirety of our existence is a dream, it follows, then, that physical death is but one more element of that dream. Death may seem to have great impact on the figure you appear to be within this dream, but it has no impact at all on you as the dreamer of the dream. As the dreamer of the dream, your awakening has nothing to do with physical death. You could, in fact, awaken at any time to the knowledge that physical existence is entirely made up. The Course refers to the state of mind in which you know you are not here as being in the real world. Once we are in that state of mind, it will not matter to us when or how our death appears to happen. Because the one thing you take with you when you die is your state of mind, we can assume that those who die and have not awakened will continue dreaming. Whether that looks like another lifetime within this world or something entirely different is beyond anyone's ability to know. Fortunately, we do not need to know this. We can rest assured that we will continue dreaming only as long as there is a part of our mind that wants to remain asleep. Ultimately, no matter what we seem to go through, a happy awakening will be the end to our imagined journey. And as the Course asks, \"Who could despair when hope like this is his?\" (C-ep.1:6)."

    "text_input": "Q #1315: I recently gave a special relationship to the Holy Spirit after the other person said that it was causing him too much mental anguish. I know the teachings of the Course, and I cannot understand that the relationship isn't becoming increasingly \"beneficent and joyous,\" even if only in my mind. It is still causing me heartache and I think about this person all day and night. I am trying my best not to see him as a body and project my \"special love\" thoughts onto him, but it just doesn't seem to be getting any easier for me. Am I doing something wrong? There isn't much else I can do but to pray for him and hand over the relationship to the Holy Spirit, is there? When the Course says our minds are joined, does that mean he must be thinking the same thing? I am very confused. A: To clear up your confusion, you need to understand an important fact about A Course in Miracles. The Course is not addressing you as the individual you think you are within this dream. Instead, Jesus is speaking to the decision making part of your mind--outside of the illusion of time and space--which has the ability to choose between the thought system of the ego or the thought system of the Holy Spirit. Thus, when he says that minds are joined, he does not mean that your individual mind is joined with that of another individual within this world. Rather, he means that all our minds are joined in reality because we all come from the same source and share the same thought systems. We all have the capacity to think either the ego's thoughts of sin, guilt, and fear, or the Holy Spirit's thoughts of love and forgiveness, inspired by the memory of God's all-encompassing Love. The Course would not ask you to struggle not to see another person as a body or to stop projecting your special love thoughts onto him. Instead, it would advise you to ask the Holy Spirit to help you simply watch all your troubling thoughts without judging them. In this way, you could gently learn to accept yourself even when you are obsessing, longing, depressed, and so on. As you do so, your mind will become an increasingly beneficent and joyous place, which will then be reflected in your experience of your relationships. This does not mean that you will always get what you think you want from others on the level of form. But you will start to be happier and more peaceful regardless of what happens externally because you will know that the love you seek is inside of you, not something you need from another. One final note: The Course offers a path for transforming our mind, which can ultimately lead us to a far greater sense of peace and happiness than we have previously known. However, it is a very gradual process and one that, because of our fear and resistance, can seem at times to make us more afraid, confused, and even depressed. For this reason, it is important not to view applying Course principles to our problems as a quick fix that will instantly take us from despair to joy. As Course students, we need to expect challenging times as we \"question every value that [we] hold\" (T-24.in.2:1).",

    "text_input": "Q #1316: I would appreciate your clarification on the issue of death in the dream, particularly the taking of one's own life. From certain answers on this Service, it seems as if suicide is a particularly unacceptable form of making the dream real. I also seem to have read that the \"form\" of death really doesn't matter; what matters is looking at anything with one's wrong mind or right mind. Hypothetically, then, a person could, take his/her life \"with a smile that says, 'These thoughts have no effect on who I am.'\" In one sense, it would be better than a death caused by a car accident or cardiac failure, for example. I've often thought that the biblical Jesus knew that his death was imminent when he entered Jerusalem for the last time and, in a sense,  took his own life, or at least had it taken from him, because he fully knew the implications of his action (assuming, of course, that there is some amount of accuracy in the biblical rendition.)",
    "output": "The whole idea of \"taking one's life\" is ego based, as we discuss in #274, as it assumes there is life in the body and that it can be \"taken.\" From that reference point, we would naturally conclude that some forms of death are less traumatic than others. But that reference point is faulty. In fact, throughout A Course in Miracles, Jesus helps us learn that our reference point as bodies is virtually worthless when it comes to understanding truth and reality. Our preoccupation with suicide and other forms of death is simply a part of the ego's strategy to keep the body, and thus the separation, real in our awareness. This is the point of Jesus telling us that we are not really afraid of death, but are attracted to it (T-19.IV-C), because that is what enables the ego to achieve its goal of keeping us from ever experiencing ourselves as decision-making minds not bound by time and space. In #274, we talk about the conditions of the \"quiet choice for death\": \"If the 'choice' represents the simple recognition of the end of the body's purpose in the world of form, the body would no longer seem to be infused with 'life,' and a whole variety of so-called natural or accidental causes could be seen in the world's view as the cause of the death.\" This is in sharp contrast to the choice to do something with the sole intention of bringing about the death of the body. About Jesus' awareness of his imminent death in Jerusalem ... no one knows for sure what happened and how it happened; but he surely would not have been thinking in terms of having his life taken from him, as he knew he was invulnerable and was not his body. He certainly knew the hidden intent of the ego in everyone's mind to destroy guiltlessness wherever it could be found (T-13.II.4,5), but he knew he, as the reflection of Heaven's eternal love, could never be killed, other than in the delusional minds of those identified with the ego's insanity. Thus, he asks of us when we question the meaning of his death, \"Teach not that I died in vain. Teach rather that I did not die by demonstrating that I live in you\" (T-11.VI.7:3-4). If we hold on to nothing else than that Jesus' all-inclusive love and compassion lives in us and can never be destroyed, we will have fulfilled his purpose for us in studying A Course in Miracles."

They choose no roles that are not given them by His authority. And so they gain by every message that they give away\" (W-pI.154.7:2-4). As I see it, the messenger has an active role here. How are these two ideas related? A: Different points are being made in the material you quote, but the content is the same. The point that is stressed in #898 is that when you let go of the ego, you are aware that you are not the individual self that you thought you were and that was always defining both the problem and the solution. When you let go of the ego, there is nothing left in your mind but love, and then your perception is identical with the Holy Spirit's. You are aligned with truth, not illusion.",
    "output": "In Lesson 154, Jesus is making a different, though related, point; and that is that our only function is to accept the Atonement through the practice of forgiveness. As \"ministers,\" we cannot truly bring Jesus' message of forgiveness to the world without first having accepted it ourselves, because in A Course in Miracles giving and receiving are the same. This is in contrast to the world's view, where the role of messengers is just to deliver messages to other people; the delivery of the message is just an external event. Jesus is teaching us that if we want to receive God's Love, we must give It--meaning we must come to recognize that we all share the same interests, and, ultimately, the same Self. I remember my true Identity as Christ only when I see that same Identity as defining everyone else. This is all about content, not form. The way we are \"active,\" thus, is by choosing to be taught by the teacher of forgiveness and oneness, not by the teacher of conflict and separation. We then become the message, just as Jesus tells us that \"to teach is to demonstrate\" (M-in.2:1). Again, this is only about what is going on in our minds (content), not behavior (form). I cannot experience the Love of God in myself if I am judging even one other person as not worthy of that Love, because what is inherently all- inclusive cannot be known through exclusion. We are active in our minds, thus; and then that content will be expressed in our interactions. In the end, then, the two statements convey the same content."

    "output": "Time can be viewed as holographic in the sense that it is not linear. But our choices, as minds, are only between two alternatives: the ego's thought system and the Holy Spirit's thought system. That is the only content in our minds, and we are never choosing anything else. Time and form blind us to that, which is why Jesus says: \"Nothing so blinding as perception of form. For sight of form means understanding has been obscured\" (T-22.III.6:7-8), and time is \"a trick, a sleight of hand, a vast illusion ... \" (W-pI.158.4:1). Time, the world, and our seeming choices in the world are all part of the ego's strategy to keep us split off from the truth that we never truly left God. The instant the separation seemed to happen, the correction of that error occurred as well. That is what Jesus is teaching us in saying, \"This world was over long ago. The thoughts that made it are no longer in the mind that thought of them and loved them for a little while\" (T- 28.I.1:6-7). In this sense, we are \"living a script that is closed to anything other than what has already happened,\" as the workbook tells us: \"The script is written ... we but see the journey from the point at which it ended, look back on it, imagining we make it once again; reviewing mentally what has gone by\" (W-pI.158.4:3,5; see also W-pI.169.8:3). Our scripts are important, however, because they provide the curriculum that our Teacher can use to help us realize that we are merely dreaming that we are separate from each other and from God: \"The miracle establishes you dream a dream, and that its content is not true\" (T-28.II.7:1). We could continue with this for many pages, but space limitations here do not allow for that. We hope, however, that this brief summary will be of help in unconfusing you. A major impediment to achieving full clarity is that our human conceptual/linguistic framework is itself an ego- derived defense against the truth, as this passage, among many others, acknowledges: \"Yet time is but another phase of what does nothing. It works hand in hand with all the other attributes with which you seek to keep concealed the truth about yourself\" (T-28.I.6:1-2). We have no other reference point, though, until we regain a sense of ourselves as decision-making minds and then realize we do not need defenses. Fortunately, that is exactly the kind of help Jesus provides in his course. We have listed below some other passages that pertain to your question, and we also refer you to Kenneth's comprehensive study of time in his book, A Vast Illusion: Time According to A Course in Miracles. \"Each day, and every minute in each day, and every instant that each minute holds, you but relive the single instant when the time of terror took the place of love\" (T-26.V.13:1). \"Each day, each hour and minute, even each second, you are deciding between the crucifixion and the resurrection; between the ego and the Holy Spirit. The ego is the choice for guilt; the Holy Spirit is the choice for guiltlessness. The power of decision is all that is yours. What you can decide between is fixed, because there are no alternatives except truth and illusion\" (T- 14.III.4:1-4). \" ... while time lasts in your mind there will be choices. Time itself is your choice. If you would remember eternity, you must look only on the eternal. If you allow yourself to become preoccupied with the temporal, you are living in time. As always, your choice is determined by what you value. Time and eternity cannot both be real, because they contradict each other. If you will accept only what is timeless as real, you will begin to understand eternity and make it yours\" (T-10.V.14:3-9). \"Time seems to go in one direction, but when you reach its end it will roll up like a long carpet spread along the past behind you, and will disappear. As long as you believe the Son of God is guilty you will walk along this carpet, believing that it leads to death\" (T-13.I.3:5-6). \"Past, present and future are not continuous, unless you force continuity on them ... You would destroy time's continuity by breaking it into past, present and future for your own purposes\" (T- 13.VI.4:2,6). \"Time lasted but an instant in your mind, with no effect upon eternity. And so is all time past, and everything exactly as it was before the way to nothingness was made. The tiny tick of time in which the first mistake was made, and all of them within that one mistake, held also the Correction for that one, and all of them that came within the first\" (T-26.V.3:3-5)."

They seem to go nowhere. The overall thought is that I am fooling myself with the notion that I can find salvation. It is as if I am trying to digest the words to feed the hunger that I have for God. The self- awareness stays with me all the time like a sentinel that stops me from letting go of the physical world so I can go into the spirit world. In the simplest way, how can I apply the teaching of A Course in Miracles to this problem of being trapped in self-awareness? How can I use the Course if the words just get trapped inside my head? A: You can use the Course very effectively by quietly slipping past the words to the Love that inspires them, and just staying with that. That, after all, is the goal of every student's work with the Course. The words are not what it is about, as Jesus reminds us: \" ... words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality\" (M-21.1:9-10).",

We all have split minds; we all are both attracted to that Love and terrified of It, because we know that in Its Presence, our individuality and self-awareness would disappear. We know that our false self is an interference to our awareness of Love's presence, but part of us does not want to let go of it out of fear. Being upset just makes the ego all the more real. It is better to quietly acknowledge that part of you is still afraid, and that's okay. Don't fight against it or judge yourself for it. Gentleness and kindness toward yourself is a very helpful way of accepting the Love that is always present in your mind. The path of A Course in Miracles is learning how not to take the ego seriously. It is dispelled with a gentle smile, the smile of calm assurance that the ego has no power to change reality; and reality is Love. The ego's raucous shrieking will fade into its own nothingness as you gradually learn to take the ego less seriously. \"The part [of you] that is listening to the Voice for God is calm, always at rest and wholly certain. It is really the only part there is\" (W-pI.49.2:1-2). If you feel it would be helpful, there is nothing wrong with consulting a therapist to help you deal with your concerns and anxieties. Many times, this form of help blends well with our efforts to free ourselves from the blocks in our minds."

There must, then, be a sense of sinfulness and guilt still hidden in the mind that gets projected onto the world. That is why so much of our work with A Course in Miracles centers on recognizing how we are \"making the error real\"--that is, how our reactions and perceptions reveal an underlying belief that we are separate from God and feel guilty because of that. Once we make that connection, we can ask for help to choose to see everything differently. Real deliverance from the world comes in the recognition that the world is the source of neither suffering or happiness, but is simply the projection of the mind caught in the illusory belief it is separate from God (W-pI.132; W-pII.226). We get to that stage by first becoming aware of how much we do see the world as the cause of both suffering and happiness. This is why Jesus teaches us that \"Forgiveness is the key to happiness\" and \"Forgiveness offers everything I want\" (W-pI.121,122). This is the \"real alternative\" that Jesus discusses in the final chapter of the text (T-31.IV), where he talks about the state of mind known as the real world, which precedes our awakening from the dream entirely. As we continue on the path of forgiveness with Jesus as our teacher, we becomes less and less identified with life in the world, which actually makes living here easier, in the sense of relieving the pressure most of us feel from taking what goes on in our lives so seriously. As we choose the ego less often, the love in our right mind begins to direct our every thought and action, and our investment in being an individual special self diminishes greatly. We continue to fulfill our roles responsibly, but without pressure and conflict. In this state, there would be not be a feeling of urgency to awaken as quickly as possible because you would not experience yourself as separate from love. Being present to all things and all people with Jesus would be a source of security and quiet joy and peace. Peace, really, is the goal of our work with the Course, not knowledge (Heaven) (T-8.I.1; T-24.in.1:1). And we are assured of peace by choosing the teacher of peace more and more often, who would help us experience our oneness with everyone. Patience and gentleness with yourself will help you through this process, as will trust in the process of forgiveness."

    "output": "The \"very real relationships\" are holy relationships: instances in which you forgave someone or did not judge; instances in which you did not see your interests as separate from another's. It could have been an interaction with a waiter in a restaurant who was having a bad day, but you did not judge him; or perhaps a child ran into you in the supermarket, but you did not get angry; or you may have had only compassion for someone who was unkind. You may not even have realized at the time that you transcended your ego; and in that sense you did not recognize these \"real relationships.\" In the manual, Jesus discusses this idea in the context of levels of teaching or teaching-learning situations (M-3)."

    "text_input": "Q #1322: There appears to be a contradiction in A Course in Miracles, or perhaps in my understanding of it. It is saying that the suffering in our dream is a reflection of the suffering caused by guilt in our minds, and the benefits of a healed mind is a happy dream. On the other hand, it says that our bad times in the dream are reflecting and bringing into our awareness our unconscious guilt and making it conscious so that we can forgive it and release. When we are able to do that, our innocent mind brings the benefits of reflecting that outward while we still believe we are here. Then why should we question these good times as just a cover over unconscious guilt? In other words, how do we determine if the blessings in our dream are covering up the guilt, or they are just the benefits of right thinking and a healed mind? And do most people believe that their suffering is bringing them closer to God, rather than a dream of health, abundance, and joy? A: Good question! Many students have experienced confusion over this. What helps is to sort out form and content. A happy dream in A Course in Miracles is a state of mind (content) in which the Holy Spirit has been chosen as your Teacher, and only His purpose for everything is valued. Though still within the illusion, it is called a happy dream because instead of being the ego's",
    "output": "dream of condemnation, judgment, and self-centeredness, it is the right-minded dream of forgiveness, compassion, and shared purpose. This is all within the mind--its content. Once this state has been reached, you are always at peace: all sense of lack is gone; there is no guilt or self-hatred; and no need for projection or other defenses. And most important for the context of your question, there is no concern over anything external, no investment in having things go a certain way in the world, or in having what the world defines as good fortune or blessings. Your peace and happiness are not dependent on anything external. Further, nothing is taken personally--either so-called good times or bad times, because nothing is perceived in those terms. Jesus says this in many ways in the Course, one coming in the section \"Above the Battleground\": \"Think what is given those who share their Father's purpose, and who know that it is theirs. They want for nothing. Sorrow of any kind is inconceivable ... They know it is impossible their happiness could ever suffer change of any kind ... No one who knows that he has everything could seek for limitation, nor could he value the body's offerings\" (T-23.IV.8:1- 3,6; 9:4). Now, it is true that if there is no guilt in your mind, you would not seek to punish yourself in any way. But how that would appear in form is not knowable. It cannot be evaluated using the categories of the world. For instance, in the world's judgment, some pretty awful things happened to Jesus' body; yet, he did not suffer because he knew he was not his body, and he never perceived himself as persecuted or betrayed (see T-6.I.5,9,11). We thus need to be cautious about drawing conclusions simply from the condition of one's body or life circumstances (form). And we also need to keep in mind the Course's central teaching that perception is always interpretation (see for example, T-11.VI.2,3). As another example: the projection of my guilt onto my body may be the source of my illness; but then I could let go of that guilt and choose to learn further lessons in that same bodily condition. In other words, my illness is now my classroom, and so I would perceive the illness in a completely different way. The illness may be ravaging my body, but if in the process I am learning that I am not my body and that no one else is theirs, I would not be experiencing the illness as anything negative, even as I continue with medical treatment. The content in my mind would have shifted. What brings me closer to God, thus, is not the suffering, but the purpose I have chosen to give it in my mind. However, I can choose that same purpose of undoing my belief in separation with a healthy body, too; and I can choose it whether I am financially secure or struggling financially. One more example: a healed mind could choose the appearance of a diseased or defective body as a means of teaching others they can be peaceful no matter what is going on externally. That mind would be totally at peace at all times (content), in the face of what the world might call misfortune (form). That abiding state of peace is the \"benefit\" of having a healed mind. In that state, you would know that nothing else is real, and that nothing can affect that peace in any way. Moreover, aside from your smiling more frequently, your life would probably be indistinguishable from anyone else's (W-pI.155.1). On the other hand, if your state of mind is linked to external conditions, then you should suspect some ego dynamics at work. If you are happy and content only under certain conditions, and your happiness and contentment are threatened or disappear when those conditions change, that should tell you that the happiness is not authentic. The joy and peace that God intended us to have as His creation are eternal; they are not conditional and they do not fluctuate or change--they are our very Identity unified with His. In Lesson 133, Jesus gives us some criteria to use in determining whether what we are choosing is of value or not (W-pI.133). The only true blessings are those that restore to our awareness the all-inclusiveness of love, the all-inclusiveness of the Sonship."

A friend of mine knows he is an angel but is struggling to understand the technicalities of such an appearance in the dream. Is he correct in thinking he is simply a manifestation of the Holy Spirit (i.e., the memory or thought of Christ's Oneness with God) in the same way as other enlightened beings who show up?",
    "output": "When Jesus speaks of angels in A Course in Miracles, he is always referring to the loving thoughts of God within us, not external beings. He is using a term that evokes a sense of comfort and protection, but he does not mean that there are actual spiritual beings called angels, as is taught in some religions. These are symbols representing thoughts in our mind. (See Questions #36 and #413ii.) From the Course's point of view, there are no \"technicalities\" that an enlightened being would have to deal with. That healed mind would be completely at peace, knowing there is no world \"out there\"-- just other minds believing they exist in a state of separation from God as bodies, caught up in a system of defenses to protect their separation from God and each other, and to project responsibility for this separation onto others. Jesus, as the manifestation of the Holy Spirit, symbolizes the truth for us in a form that we can relate to. He simply reflects to us what is within us--the truth that nothing real can ever affect the Love of God in which we were created and forever remain."

    "text_input": "Q #1324: I was playing chess on the computer and began to think that I was wasting my life doing this; I'm not being spiritual enough. The other side of the coin is thinking I'm good because I spent a lot of time with my kids. I am aware of the ego traps in this, but I think underneath it is the idea that I have to sacrifice things of the world to let go enough to undo the ego, especially in light of passages from the Course that seem to teach that if we don't fulfill our function, we have indeed wasted our life. That's intimidating. What would it mean to fulfill your function? Is watching myself getting mad at myself for playing on the computer part of fulfilling my function? Is it possible to fulfill your function a little, or for a little while, then slip? I always feel like I'm being graded!!! A: The last statement is quite important: \"I always feel like I'm being graded\"--spoken as a good healthy ego! That is what you want to look at, because that indicates your study of A Course in Miracles must be being guided by the ego. Guilt distorts. That is why there is so much emphasis in the Course on bringing the darkness to the light. Therein lies your function: bringing your guilt to the presence of love in your right mind, or looking at your guilt with the healing eyes of love. And you can do this whether you are playing chess on the computer or spending time with your kids. It's not the form--it's the content. You can play chess with guilt or without guilt; you can play with your kids with guilt or without guilt. It is always a question of which teacher you choose beforehand in your mind.",
    "output": "This is the message of two important sections in the text: \"Setting the Goal\" (T-17.VI) and \"The Consistency of Means and End\" (T-20.VII). We first decide on the goal or end we want to attain: for example, peace, seeing our interests as shared with everyone else. Then the activity will be seen as the means to achieve this end. The activity itself (the form) won't matter. The content alone will provide the meaning for you. So, it is not what you do that is important, but the purpose you have given to it--with whom you do it, the ego or Jesus. There is no hierarchy of illusions: some activities are not \"good\" for us and others \"bad\"; some are not holy and others unholy. The world is not the problem; therefore, we need sacrifice nothing. If we truly want the peace of God, then we will look at how we are using things in the world to interfere with that peace, and then ask for help to use them to undo the interference. This really is the core of what Jesus discusses in \"The Special Function\" where he tells us that \"forgiveness is the only function meaningful in time\" (T-25.VI.5:3); that is a matter of choosing against the ego's purpose for our bodies and relationships (separation and specialness), and for the Holy Spirit's (forgiveness and peace). The Course is constantly training us to look within and focus on the purpose we are always giving to the interactions and activities in our lives. And, fortunately, there are only two possible choices, only one of which will undo the separation, bring us peace, and lead us home. It is quite normal to be inconsistent in this process of shifting from outside to within, and from the ego's purpose to the Holy Spirit's. We are tremendously fearful of the implications of letting go of our ego, and so we bounce back and forth. But as we experience more and more the peace and calmness of mind that comes when we forgive, we will be motivated to choose it more frequently. Then the discomfort of being in our wrong minds will become more noticeable, and could be experienced as a kind of external pressure to do better. It is just that we are denying less, and the pain that was always there is coming into our awareness. Jesus never exerts pressure or imposes sanctions--that would be the ego's Jesus. Our egos, eager to subvert our work with the Course, will tempt us to distort Jesus' gentle message of forgiveness into a threatening message of judgment. The more we recognize that intrusion, the more we can learn to simply smile at its silliness and allow the non-judgmental, comforting presence of love in our minds to be the source of all we do."

    "text_input": "Q #1325: I am wrestling with some metaphysical principles of A Course in Miracles, things I can't understand yet, or maybe don't want to accept. The Course says that everything we perceive is an illusion of our own making. It also has much to say about the role of the ego in our \"special relationships.\" I lost my much loved only daughter to leukemia 11 years ago, and it is very difficult for me to believe she was just a figment of my imagination. I realize that we are all one, and that there is no individuality as we recognize our oneness with God and return fully to Him. As I write this I see that I am clinging to her individuality as much as my own, which will not get me where I want to go. Can you help me see this in a more enlightened way? Somehow, acknowledging that she is just an identity I made up is a painful thing for me, as I do miss her and still love her very much. Also, does she simply exist in my imagination, since she cannot be directly observed? A: No, your daughter is not just a figment of your imagination. When we talk about made-up identities, we are not talking about one body imagining the existence of another body--a mother imagining she has a daughter. This is a meant on a completely different level. You need to take it",
    "output": "back to the level of the mind, a state of abstraction that this same mind has concealed and replaced with a self bound to specifics. That is why practically none of us can relate to our identity as mind (W-pI.161.2). The \"our\" in \"everything we perceive is an illusion of our own making\" is thus the mind that has identified with the ego thought system, not the physical/psychological human being we think we are. And woven into this deceit is the need to assign responsibility for the state of separation and its consequences to an external agent of some kind so that the mind's focus would never be on itself, where it might realize that its choice to follow the ego was not worth the price it has paid. The ego thus designs identities and relationships to serve its own life-preserving purpose. This means that when the mind identifies with the ego thought system, it will split off into identities that form relationships that confirm the separation as real and that things happen that appear not to have been chosen. Accordingly, we experience needs that must be met on pain of physical and/or psychological devastation. It is essential for the ego's survival that this consciously chosen purpose in the mind remain hidden. Its dynamic of projection achieves this end by producing mindless individual beings not responsible for their own existence, and that are subject to forces beyond their control--a world of victims and victimizers. This is the dream of separation the mind no longer realizes it is dreaming. And this is why a major focus of A Course in Miracles is to help us regain our identity as minds that are always choosing, for what also got buried was the other thought system in our mind--the correction of the ego's, the memory of our true Identity as Christ. Jesus therefore leads us in that direction by stressing the importance of getting at the purpose our relationships serve, something most of us would never think of, other than in terms of the world's dictates. We will experience tremendous resistance to this shift from form to content because, having identified with the ego, we will feel that our very foundation is being threatened, and that everything we have thought has been wrong. So we have to take small steps and not think we can instantly jump right back into our identity as spirit. There is far too much fear in most of us to make that sudden leap. Jesus asks only that we remember, when we can, that there is another way of looking at everything in our lives, where we will wind up feeling peaceful, regardless of what is happening or has happened--unlike the ego's way that always winds up preserving separation and conflict. Applied to your circumstances, this means, first, that it is not wrong to miss your daughter. On one level, it would be strange if you did not miss her--you are the mother, she the daughter. Mothers miss their children. But what Jesus is teaching is that the way you are relating to your deceased daughter reflects a choice you have made in your mind to uphold either the ego's purpose for the relationship (separation, the body, and death are real), or the Holy Spirit's (shared identities, death has no effect on the mind). He asks only that you be open to that as a possibility. The \"more enlightened way\" you are seeking would thus be to see how you might be using the death of your daughter to further the ego's goals, and that you can ask for help to change that purpose to one of forgiveness. That will not result in your loving your daughter any less, or in the disappearance of your identity as her mother. There will just be a different quality to those experiences and your sense of loss will gradually disappear. For further discussion of the Course's approach to death and grieving, see Questions #15, #112, and #938. If you are interested in a comprehensive explanation of the metaphysics of separation, see the second and third chapters in Kenneth's book All Are Called, Vol. One of The Message of A Course in Miracles."

    "text_input": "Q #1326: My younger daughter (age 25) hasn't spoken to me in about three years. She is angry with me as a result of a disagreement over her middle boy who lives with his father nearby. My daughter has a mood disorder for which she quit taking meds, and I am certain she also has bipolar disorder, as does her father. I understand how this affects people because I have lived with it and also researched it. She has two children I have never seen as they were born after she stopped speaking to me. I love her and the kids very much. I am trying to work with the Holy Spirit and the Course to deal with this problem, however, I am still human, and I still need help. I am trying to be accepting of her wishes and so forth, but do you have any ideas for me on this? A: You say that while you are working with A Course in Miracles, you are still human and still need help. That is a very useful thing to recognize. While the Course is a wonderful guide to changing our mind--providing the ultimate solution to all our problems--it does not offer any guidance about what we should do behaviorally or how we should handle anything on the level of form. Therefore, until our mind is completely healed, there will undoubtedly be continual issues for which we seem to need more than the Course provides--issues such as physical illness, stormy relationships, and so on. Often, Course students mistakenly feel that they should not need to do all the \"normal\" things that ordinary people do during difficult times. However, this is a misinterpretation of Jesus' message. In truth, Jesus would advise us to do whatever we think would be most effective and comforting for us and not feel guilty about it. In the situation you have described, that might mean talking to a counselor, a trusted friend, etc. Without knowing a great deal more about your situation and all the people involved in it, we would not want to attempt to give you specific advice about what to do. Nevertheless, your desire for support and specific advice is entirely reasonable, and we urge you to find a trustworthy source that can fulfill this need. As you do this, continue asking the Holy Spirit to help you see your daughter, this situation, and yourself through His forgiving eyes. Try not to fall into another common Course student trap of denying or feeling guilty about all the non-forgiving thoughts and feelings that may come up for you in the process. While forgiveness is always our ultimate goal, we cannot get there without dealing with everything that stands between forgiveness and our present state of mind. The situation you are in--feeling rejected by your daughter and kept apart from your grandchildren-- would be emotionally charged and very painful for most people. It would be completely understandable if you felt angry, hurt, vengeful, defensive, and so forth. Of course, you do not want to act upon these feelings. And yet, ironically, the way to ensure that you do not take these feelings out on your daughter, yourself, or other family members, is to allow yourself to have them. By bringing love and acceptance to your own troubled mind, you can gradually allow your mind to become a place of genuine sanity and peace, even as you have to face what feels like a familial battleground.",

Jesus tells us we are not real, the separation never occurred, there is no ego, no body, no world, not even the dream is real; yet we experience so much grief, pain, loss, etc. So whose consciousness are we? How are we responsible for everything we experience?",
    "output": "Who are we anyway? I just don't get our essence, if we are not real, if we don't exist, if God doesn't even know we are here, what are we? If this is Jesus' dream, how are we responsible for all we painfully experience in what seems to never end? Are we just stage puppets in a dream, as we cannot seem to wake from this nightmare! I feel unbelievably alone since I read that God doesn't know we exist. A: Yes, this aspect of the Course's teachings can be very upsetting and disorienting--many people have felt the same kind of distress you are feeling. But, fortunately, the Course itself rescues us from our confusion, and in fact gives us great hope and comfort as we deal with what certainly does seem like a nightmare. What will help ease your anxiety is to realize that A Course in Miracles is presented on two levels. Level One teaches us the absolute truth about reality--all the statements that say in one way or another that the separation from God never truly happened, and therefore that nothing of the world or the body is real. But since that level of absolute truth is just about meaningless to us, the Course is presented on another level. Level Two meets us where we are (see T-25.I.5-7)--as individuals living in a physical universe, experiencing grief, pain, loss, loneliness, etc. On this level, Jesus teaches us how to use all of these experiences to help us get back in touch with the truth that is still in our minds, but covered over. Thus, Level Two teaches us that we can use our bodies and the world either for a wrong-minded or right- minded purpose; we can choose to have the ego as our teacher or Jesus (or the Holy Spirit) as our teacher as we go through our daily lives. So Jesus relates to us in the context of what we experience as real, and then helps us to transform it so that it will be helpful to us, not harmful. The goal of our work with the Course, thus, is to become more and more right-minded in our thinking, which means gradually letting go of guilt, fear, and all of our judgments and hatred. We then will be more kind to ourselves and others, and much more peaceful much more often. The key point of these Level Two teachings is that we have within our minds the power to choose which teacher we will follow (Jesus or the ego), and that we are always choosing one or the other, even though we are not aware of doing that. Through our study and practice of the Course's principles, though, we will gradually become aware that we are making these choices, and we will be able to see from our experiences which thought system we have chosen in our minds. We thus are not puppets because we all have this power of choice, of which the Course reminds us over and over. The objective of Jesus' training is to put us back in touch with our real strength as minds. That is what will free us from the awful burden of feeling trapped in what seems like a never-ending nightmare of pain, conflict, and struggle. He assures us that we cannot fail in this, and that his loving presence is always beside us, as he says in Lesson 302: \"Our Love awaits us as we go to Him, and walks beside us showing us the way. He fails in nothing. He the End we seek, and He the Means by which we go to Him\" (W-pII.302.2)."

Currently, I am reading All Are Called (Vol. One of The Message of A Course in Miracles) and came across a passage on page 111, as follows: \" ... we can see that all persons--indeed, the entire animal, plant, and mineral kingdoms--who are in this world, or better, believe that they are in this world, come with the ego thought system intact.\" I have no problem following the logic that we humans are ensnared within the ego thought system and can choose between the ego and the Holy Spirit, but I don't quite follow how a skunk, a stalk of  asparagus, or a boulder could possibly possess an ego or arrive at a similar choice. Or am I making the mistake of believing that there is a hierarchy of illusions when, in fact, there is only one illusion, and that is the idea that separation from God is possible, and that any sentient form of life in this world must also be a part of the fragmentation that resulted from the fourth ego split?",
    "output": "Yes, you have answered your own question--there is only one illusion, but it has taken many forms. We (the one Son of God) \"made but one substitution. It has taken many forms, because it was the substitution of illusion for truth; of fragmentation for wholeness. It has become so splintered and subdivided and divided again, over and over, that it is now almost impossible to perceive it once was one, and still is what it was\" (T-18.I.4:1-3). It still is one! There is one thought of separation, appearing in billions of forms, so as to give truth to the lie of separation from God, and render the truth of oneness non-existent. \"Nothing so blinding as perception of form. For sight of form means understanding has been obscured\" (T-22.III.6:7-8). That was the ultimate objective of the ego's strategy--to wipe from our awareness any trace of our origin as separated beings, and to make the truth unrecognizable to us, if not a preposterous absurdity: \"When you made visible what is not true, what is true became invisible to you\" (T-12.VIII.3:1). Part of our difficulty in comprehending the Course's teachings about the separation (aside from the fact that it is illusory) is that we attempt to do so from our perspective. In other words, our reference point is our own experience as human beings in the world--the world of form. From that reference point, it certainly does not make sense to think of a stalk of asparagus as having a mind and the ability to choose. But, again, that is precisely where the ego wants us to wind up. And that is what Jesus is getting at when he says in the workbook, \"One brother is all brothers. Every mind contains all minds, for every mind is one. Such is the truth ... Do these words bring perfect clarity with them to you? What can they seem to be but empty sounds ... The mind that taught itself to think specifically can no longer grasp abstraction in the sense that it is all- encompassing\" (W-pI.161.4:1-7). It is certainly true that most people who begin working with A Course in Miracles have no reference point other than their own experience; but after considerable time with the Course, they begin to realize that Jesus is teaching us that everything we experience is a symbol of the choice we are always making in our minds, and therefore things are not as they appear to be. That is why he tells us that to learn this course we need to question every value we hold (T-24.in.2:1). As we grow in this realization and rise to the level of true perception beyond the intellect, we then will share Jesus' vision, expressed here in the language of form: \"How holy is the smallest grain of sand, when it is recognized as being part of the completed picture of God's Son! The forms the broken pieces seem to take mean nothing. For the whole is in each one. And every aspect of the Son of God is just the same as every other part\" (T-28.IV.9:4-7)."

Would it be somewhat like the way reincarnation is seen--reasonably benignly, but with warnings? It seems to me that if I tried to incorporate chakra thinking, I would be edging toward making the body real--not Course-like at all! If I think of the chakra idea as a reminder to be open to the miracle, to see things differently, to accept the Atonement for myself, I think that's not chakra-like at all!",
    "output": "One of the primary messages of A Course in Miracles is that everything within this dream of physical existence is the same. It all came from the ego's thought of separation, and it can all now be used either for the ego's purpose of making the error real and remaining asleep, or for the Holy Spirit's purpose of remembering God's Love and gently awakening to our reality in Heaven. As Course students, we should remember that every time we take a breath we are making the body real, and Jesus certainly would not ask us to stop breathing. In fact, he is not asking us to guard against making the body real nor to give up anything we want. He simply urges us to ask ourselves what purpose we are giving everything--a loving purpose, or one that exacerbates our guilt. For this reason, Jesus would not have an opinion about chakras. To him, studying the Course and working with chakras would be no different than, for example, studying the Course and believing it is helpful to have an elbow. In Heaven, there is no need for elbows. But while we think we are here, we can either use elbows to viciously jab others or to facilitate our extension of a helping hand. Similarly, if you use your understanding of chakras to make yourself different from other people and, meanwhile, tell yourself that the key to peace is having open chakras rather than God's Love, then that would be a recipe for conflict with the Course's teachings. However, if you recognize that like everything else here, chakras are illusory, but nevertheless you find the concept helpful, then it would be silly not to work with them or to feel guilty for doing so."

There is a line on page 244 [pages 237-38 in second edition] that I'm very drawn to and that I frequently say each day: \"If You will tell me what to do, I will to do it.\" It is a prayer that Jesus tells Helen is the door that leads out of the desert forever. Yet, I wonder if it's inappropriate for me to ask Jesus this. Is it possible that Jesus was providing specifics to Helen and Bill because of their involvement with the scribing of A Course in Miracles? Can you help reconcile the seeming inconsistency of Jesus providing highly specific guidance about worldly concerns to Helen (and Bill) and the statements that Ken has made about Jesus not providing this type of guidance? A: We have addressed the topic in some Questions asked by other students--see, for example, #437, #477, #538, and #626. It has been a source of confusion for many. In Chapter 17 of Absence from Felicity, Ken actually explains why Helen experienced Jesus as guiding her in specifics. There he shows that it is really not a question of Jesus doing anything different with Helen and Bill than with others, but rather what Helen did with her mind's fear of accepting the fullness of love symbolized by Jesus. This is instructive to all of us. We all have tremendous fear of melting into love's presence, our true Identity, and so we unconsciously determine the form in which we will accept that content of love. Thus, Helen allowed herself to experience his love only in the form of guidance with specifics, as many of us do. But, as Ken makes clear, Helen also knew that Jesus was the reflection of Heaven's love, and so there were times when she transcended all limitation and no longer identified with a limited self, separated from love and fearful of it. This is what the Questions cited above discuss in depth. But none of this means that you should not continue to say the prayer you like so much, or to ask Jesus to help you. Just try to remember that it is the love that Jesus is that you truly want. That way, you won't stay on the",

    "text_input": "Q #1331: I've been studying the Course over a long period of time and so it seems strange to me that I'm having this thought. The thought is: I really don't want to be here any longer. It's a thought that I experience so deeply and so frequently each day. It's a thought that haunts me. Now, I do understand that the Course is about changing our mind and not about going to another place. I also understand that suicide is not the answer since the death of the body doesn't solve anything. Maybe the deep longing to be out of this world is really a reflection of wanting to be out of the misery that having an ego entails--but this process takes so very long. Could you help me with this? A: Recognizing that you do not want to be here is not only a normal and predictable consequence of studying A Course in Miracles, but, in fact, a crucial one. Again and again, the Course returns to the theme that this world is not our home. Indeed, it beautifully describes the experience of feeling haunted by the thought of not wanting to be here: \" ... there is a Child in you Who seeks His Father's house, and knows that He is alien here ... It is this Child Who knows His Father. He desires to go home so deeply, so unceasingly, His voice cries unto you to let Him rest a while ... He whispers of His home unceasingly to you\" (W-p1.182.4:3; 5:2-3; 7:4). Because most of us have spent our entire lives keeping this unceasing voice deeply buried, Jesus' efforts in the Course to bring it to our awareness can feel quite shocking. We may simultaneously be comforted that he knows exactly how we feel and frightened that we now have to acknowledge a truth that threatens the very foundation of who we think we are. Fortunately, there is another message in the Course that makes this situation bearable. Jesus teaches us that we are not here. He tells us, \"Nothing at all has happened but that you have put yourself to sleep, and dreamed a dream in which you were an alien to yourself\" (T-28.II.4:1). He further teaches us that since this is a dream, we have control over the dream's content: \"...there is a choice of dreams while you are still asleep, depending on the purpose of your dreaming. A dream is like a memory in that it pictures what you wanted shown to you\" (T-28.II.4:3,5). This, then, provides the key with which we can face the sense of not wanting to be here and ultimately find relief from the pain it causes us. The ego would have us interpret our desire not to be here as a longing to leave the physical world--an inherently futile endeavor because there is no physical world from which to escape. The Holy Spirit, on the other hand, would reinterpret this desire as the perfectly sensible and achievable longing to awaken and leave the state of mind that has brought us nothing but pain. Therefore, by turning over the thought, \"I don't want to be here any longer\" to the Holy Spirit, we can have it transformed from a hopeless lament about our seemingly external situation into an inspirational wake-up call to change our internal situation. In the process, the world will seem to change from a noxious prison to a wondrous classroom. When we are tempted to feel like prisoners here, threatened by seemingly cruel external forces and frustrated by a spiritual journey that can feel slow and rocky, we would do well to remember the following words: \" ... there must be another way of looking at [the world]. I see everything upside down, and my thoughts are the opposite of truth. I see the world as a prison for God's Son. It must be, then, that the world is really a place where he can be set free. I would look upon the world as it is, and see it as a place where the Son of God finds his freedom\" (W-p1.57.3).",

I understand the idea that sickness, according to A Course in Miracles, is of the mind and is a perspective, etc. However, we obviously will all die of something unless we have reached a level of enlightenment in which we can just leave our bodies at will and break with the illusion. Does this mean that everyone who dies, no matter what level they have reached spiritually is still holding \"unforgiveness\"? I know of some very high beings who still got diseases, had strokes, and other health issues.",
    "output": "A Course in Miracles states that \"no one dies without his own consent\" (W-pI.152.1); but this decision can be wrong-minded or right-minded. Our discussion in #262 focuses on the important distinction between form and content in the Course's view of death. Helpful references are also provided there as well as in Questions #494 and #604. The key point is that the condition of the body does not automatically tell us which thought system the mind has chosen and whether or not the mind has reached enlightenment. Thus, we should not attempt to judge based upon appearances. A healed mind could take the form of a cancer-consumed dying body if there were a valuable teaching purpose in it, for example. That mind, though, would not be suffering--a most difficult teaching for us to comprehend and accept, because of our lack of awareness of our mind and our body-oriented way of thinking. Jesus' body certainly seemed to be in terrible condition at the end, but we would not conclude that his mind must therefore have been in terrible condition as well. A seemingly pain-wracked body is not necessarily a regrettable tragedy, in other words. Again, this can only be understood from the perspective of the mind's right-minded position \"above the battleground\" of the ego's world of bodies."

    "text_input": "Q #1333: I read your reply to #913 with great interest. I have also noticed the Course making people more assertive and aggressive, even unbalancing otherwise rather \"normal\" and friendly people by perhaps influencing them subconsciously. You/the Course seem to say that this is simply the ego fighting back, but I wonder whether A Course in Miracles, in itself, is very assertive in the way it presents its \"truth,\" and therefore (deliberately?) causes these emotional storms, aggressive behavior, and hateful thoughts to come forth. Is the Course some sort of \"provocative therapy\" much like homeopathy only in much more powerful degrees? It uses sentences like \"I told you\" and \"do this,\" which sound very authoritative. As justification of its authoritative way of presenting its point of view, it says it comes directly from Jesus, the Holy Spirit, or even God. Is my interpretation correct? A: Your interpretation is not quite right. To explain why, let us address your final point first. The Course does not claim to have come from God. It is written in Jesus' authoritative voice, but this is not the result of a calculated attempt to justify a point of view. Rather, it is a reflection of the fact that it was inspired by a source of love from outside this dream of time and space--one which many of us within this dream, including the Course's scribe, experience as coming through the voice of Jesus.",
    "output": "The Course teaches that until now we have been listening to the voice of the ego, and it asks us to look honestly at the misery this has caused us. It informs us that we have access to another internal Teacher, the Holy Spirit, and that we would be much happier if we dropped the ego's hand and took the Holy Spirit's hand instead. It is unequivocal about the fact that this world is an illusion born from guilt and that therefore, we will never find lasting happiness or peace from anything within this world--we will only find it by changing our mind. The difficulty is that, \"To learn this course requires willingness to question every value that you hold\" (T-24.in.2:1). As long as we are listening to the ego, it is very difficult to hear that we are wrong about everything and should question all our values. Indeed, under the ego's guidance, it is virtually impossible not to hear that as an attack and react with emotional storms, aggressive behavior, and hateful thoughts. It is not the Course's goal that we experience these things, but Jesus realizes that it is almost inevitable that we will. He knows this because he recognizes that as long as we believe we are here, we merely reenact the original instant in which we stormed against God, insisting that we were right and God was wrong. Thus, when Course students seem to become overly assertive or aggressive as a result of what they are learning, it is not because they are fulfilling part of the Course's curriculum, but rather that they are reacting to the fear it has engendered. Jesus is not out to provoke us, but neither does he try to protect us from feeling provoked by his message. He simply tells us that what is true is true, what is false is false, and asks us to watch our own internal process as we learn to distinguish between the two."

    "text_input": "Q #1334: I have a question about the idea of a \"self-concept\" and its relationship to guilt. My understanding of the self-concept is this: I look in the mirror and assess the things I like and do not like about my body; whom I think about; who I am in the world financially; how I believe that I look compared to others; where I am in the world compared to others; etc. I see that there are things that I \"like\" and \"dislike\" about \"myself.\" Is it correct to say that according to A Course in Miracles, the things that I don't like about myself are really projections of unhealed guilt that I am projecting onto my made up and false \"self\" in the world and onto my body; is that correct? A: Without more specific information about what you dislike about yourself it is difficult to determine whether or not it is a projection of unhealed guilt. No one likes to hear this, but even things you like about yourself can come from unhealed guilt. It all depends on the goal you have chosen to pursue in your mind. If you (the decision-making part of your mind) are intent on validating your existence as an individual, then being kind and generous (seemingly positive traits) can be a way of having people notice you as someone very special. This would be the ego's way of dealing with unhealed guilt--cover it over with a self-concept that makes it appear that you are really a good, innocent person. But you can also use those same traits in the service of forgiveness, which would have the effect of lessening your investment in being special and different from others, a very effective way of dealing with guilt. Similarly, any form of success in the world can be an expression of your ego, but it can also be given the purpose of helping you learn that your interests are not separate from anyone else's. This is why Jesus tells us that \"Love makes no comparisons\" (W-pI.195.4:2) and that \"the ego literally lives by comparisons (T- 4.II.7:1). Comparing yourself with others ultimately makes differences real, which is essential for the ego's survival. What is helpful to remember is that on one level (Level One), all self-concepts, whether judged as positive or negative, are of the ego, because they are substitutes for our true Self as Christ, which we have denied. This is a major theme in \"Self-Concept versus Self\" (T-31.V). But on another level (Level Two), our self-concepts can be a means of helping us get in touch with the content in our minds and our power to choose to identify either with the ego or the Holy Spirit. This points out the importance of learning to focus on purpose. Thus, Jesus stresses: \"This is the question that you must learn to ask in connection with everything. What is the purpose?\" (T-",
    "output": "4.V.6:8-9). If you shift to this focus, then your work with self-concepts can be more helpful in healing your mind of the guilt that the ego has convinced us is real, but which Jesus is helping us learn is made up and never justified."

    "text_input": "Q #1335: Please comment on our relationship with Jesus, and the importance of this in A Course in Miracles. My struggle is that I have difficulty connecting with Jesus, and I would like to drop this resistance. I have felt \"spiritually void\" for most of my life, after negatively experiencing my Christian (Catholic) upbringing. I understand that forgiveness is the answer, and I feel I have forgiven; however, I don't feel within my relationship with Jesus. It was not something that was deeply cultivated in my childhood, and I have no real basis for the feeling of a \"return.\"",
    "output": "Yes, forgiveness is the answer, as it is in any relationship. Try to bring to the surface the negative images you have of Jesus, any anger or resentment. He reminds us that \"some bitter idols have been made of him who would be only brother to the world\" (C-5.5:7), and therefore we all need to become aware of what we are projecting onto Jesus, as these images and grievances prevent us from experiencing the positive elements in the relationship that are always present. Practically all formal religions of the world teach in some way that we are not worthy of God's Love, and that we must sacrifice to purify ourselves of our sinfulness. The centerpiece of Christianity in particular has always been that Jesus, wholly pure and innocent, had to die because of our sins, and that his sacrificial death was part of God's plan. And all of that has been presented as a supreme act of love. How could we not be mired in guilt and shame and highly conflicted in our relationship with Jesus? Jesus comes to us through A Course in Miracles to tell us that sacrifice can never be part of love, and that it is only we (identified with the ego in our minds) who have convinced ourselves that we are sinful and guilty. The theologies that teach of sin and sacrifice are simply expressing the core principles of the ego thought system. Jesus is helping us to see the perversion of truth in that system, and he is asking us to allow him to help us undo our belief in it. This is what he means in saying of himself, \"Forgive him your illusions, and behold how dear a brother he would be to you\" (C-5.5:8). This is the basis for any relationship with Jesus, also well expressed in this passage: \"We are ready to look more closely at the ego's thought system because together we have the lamp that will dispel it, and since you realize you do not want it, you must be ready ... We will undo this error quietly together, and then look beyond it to truth\" (T-11.V.1:3,6). This is a process of gradually developing trust in the non-judgmental presence in your mind that wants only to help you look within at all the ways in which you are keeping love away. He assures us, \"You have very little trust in me as yet, but it will increase as you turn more and more often to me instead of to your ego for guidance ... My trust in you is greater than yours in me at the moment, but it will not always be that way\" (T-4.VI.3:1; 6:1). The love is always there. In looking without judgment at all of our unkind, unloving, judgmental thoughts, we are turning to Jesus for guidance and letting go of the interferences to our awareness of that ever-present love."

It is important to be gentle with yourself and not force yourself to keep going with the lessons if you think you want to take a break from them for a while. The ego is ultimately nothing, and all fear comes from identifying with the ego; but it usually takes a long time and a great deal of practice to reach that level of experience. We just need to go slowly and not feel pressured in any way, knowing that Jesus' love is with us every instant. There are some therapies in the world that have helped people deal with panic attacks; and as we mention in #155, it would not hinder your work with the Course to avail yourself of that kind of help, if you feel you would like to."

    "text_input": "Q #1337: What is the meaning of this three-dimensional universe from the perspective of A Course in Miracles? Why are we located here on this planet? We have outer space to explore, but what is the meaning of space exploration if we do not know why we are here?",
    "output": "To answer your questions in the order you've asked them: The universe of space has no meaning from the perspective of the Course because it's not real--it's only a belief (e.g., T- 1.VI.3:4-6; T-26.VIII.1:3-5; W-pI.184.2:1-3). Therefore, we're not actually here on this planet, even though our experience, which lies--quite deliberately-- seems to tell us that we are (T- 31.VII.9). It follows then that there is also no outer space to explore, such exploration also being meaningless. However, the Course does not simply leave us hanging, wondering why what is not real seems so real to us, but tells us, not why we are here, but why we believe we are here. This universe of time and space that we seem to experience serves a purpose--actually two very different purposes, depending on which teacher we listen to. If the ego is our teacher, the universe of space proves to us that the separation is real and that we are apart from God (T- 26.VII.8:7-10). In this world, which we have dreamed up with our egos, we are isolated and alone, separated from everyone else, and potentially a victim of everyone and everything outside of ourselves. The fear and the pain we experience truly seem to have their cause in events and circumstances, spread across time and space, over which we have little or no control. And this perception of the world as cause conveniently precludes our ever considering another source for our pain and fear--the inner decision, within our mind, to see ourselves as separate from Love. The world covers over that decision and its effects, but only because we want it to. In itself the world is literally nothing. You might ask yourself--how vast is the universe of space in your dreams at night, and what meaning does that seemingly three-dimensional world hold? Why are you wherever you seem to find yourself in your dreams? And what could be gained by exploring the farthest reaches of that dream space while you believe you are one of the figures in the dream? From the Course's perspective, answers to such questions would apply equally to the world of our waking dream, which we have convinced ourselves is our real life (T-18.II.5). In contrast, with the Holy Spirit as our Teacher, this world becomes the classroom in which we learn our lessons of forgiveness. Little by little, we begin to understand that the world of time and space is nothing more than the projection of our own inner conflict, projected so that we do not see the conflict's real source within the mind. But with the Holy Spirit as our Interpreter of the world, we can begin to recognize that the world provides us a useful road map of symbols back to the unconscious conflict and guilt within our mind. And so gradually we begin to learn that there really is no need to forgive the figures in our dream--i.e., our relationships in the world. Our only need is to learn to forgive ourselves for once again turning away from love and choosing the ego and its constant companions of guilt and conflict. The resistance may be huge to making this shift, but as we at least can become clearer about Jesus' perspective on time and space, which comes from outside time and space, we can begin to take our world a little less seriously."

I feel I have done all I can to save our marriage, but came to the point where I can no longer live with the dishonesty. I do not feel anger or condemnation or judgment towards her. I feel that the Holy Spirit, not the ego, has guided me to let this relationship go. Would you comment on divorce? A: As with every other aspect of relationships, divorce can be wrong-minded or right-minded. It is thus is neither intrinsically good or bad, wrong or right, depending entirely on the content in the mind, as we discuss in #866 (#639 may also be helpful). All of the effort you have put into resolving the issues along with the fact that you experience no anger, condemnation, or judgment toward your wife would seem to indicate that your decision to end the relationship in form is probably right-minded. Our statement in #821 addressed entirely different circumstances, where the lessening of external conflict triggered intense fear of dealing with the internal conflict that the external conflict had been covering. References from A Course in Miracles cited there all pertained to that aspect of the spiritual process. Therefore, if your experience is that you are being guided by the Holy Spirit to let the relationship go, it would seem advisable to follow that. Whatever lessons remain to be learned will surface in other relationships in your life. Relationships, as we always say, are in the mind, and are ultimately between oneself and either the ego or the Holy Spirit--always a matter of content, not form. Accordingly, before, during, and after a divorce, we can still practice perceiving our interests as the same as the other person's, as that is independent of the form of the relationship. The form of our relationships set up the classroom in which we choose to be led by the ego--following a curriculum of separate and competing interests--or Jesus or the Holy Spirit--following a curriculum of shared and unified interests, leading us finally to a vision of our shared Identity.",

    "text_input": "Q #1339: I've been thinking about attacking people who are close to me, family, friends, etc. You know the expression, \"Familiarity breeds contempt\"? What does the course say about us attacking those we depend on?",
    "output": "A Course in Miracles is consistent in teaching that attack is always of the ego, regardless of circumstances and the person or persons to whom it is directed. The need to attack others comes from our usually unconscious perception of ourselves as guilty sinners deserving of attack ourselves, because we are unforgivable. We therefore project this self-accusation onto others and feel justified in attacking them: \"If you did not believe that you deserved attack, it never would occur to you to give attack to anyone at all. Why should you? What would be the gain to you? What could the outcome be that you would want? And how could murder bring you benefit?\" (T- 31.III.2:7-11). This section in the text \"The Self-Accused\" summarizes this central dynamic in the ego's strategy to keep our focus from the mind, where our mistaken beliefs about ourselves can be healed, and focused instead on other people's bodies and deeds that clearly seem to be the reasons for our problems and unhappiness. The hostility we feel toward those on whom we depend is a specific aspect of this dynamic. This type of hostility can be associated with a substance and even medical technology (there have been cases of people who developed hostility toward their dialysis machines). What is triggered in us in dependency relationships is a very deep sense of vulnerability and threat. In other words, being dependent on others exposes the precarious nature of our existence--that we are not self- sufficient. We therefore would want to attack those who expose our weaknesses and limitations. The conflict can become rather intense because however much we wish to destroy these people, we know we can't go through with it, because we still need them. We therefore will come up with other ways of acting out our hostility, through passive aggression, for example. Another reason for the hostility, from the Course's point of view, is that we perceive these others as having something we lack, and we would secretly accuse them of having stolen it from us first, the fourth law of chaos in the ego's insane thought system (T-23.II.9-11). This ego dynamic would lead us to believe our anger and attack are justified, as a form of self-defense; we would feel completely innocent in attacking to get back what rightfully belongs to us. We all have to deal with dependency issues, as that is the way the body was made, both physically and psychologically. We all have basic physical and psychological needs which must be met if we are to survive. The ego's secret purpose in this, of course, is to keep us rooted in the world and the body, so that we will never return to the mind where we would have an excellent chance of uncovering the falsity of these beliefs about who we are and what our true and only need is, which is simply to undo our false belief that we separated from our Creator in an act of extreme selfishness. Thus, the ego's undoing begins with our willingness to look with Jesus at the insanity of the thought system that harbors these beliefs and attitudes, and then ask for help to accept his thought system instead. Jesus himself tells us that our dependency on him as our teacher is only temporary, as his aim is to help us get to the place spiritually where we regain our awareness that we are all the one Son of God: \"There is nothing about me that you cannot attain. I have nothing that does not come from God. The difference between us now is that I have nothing else. This leaves me in a state which is only potential in you\" (T-1.II.3:10-13)."

Are the \"levels\" or \"order of needs\" a reference to Maslow's hierarchy of needs? What does it mean to correct errors from \"the bottom up\" (T-1.VI.3)? My sense is that one should not deny one's apparent needs while we still perceive ourselves as bodies, in the world. Am I on the right track in thinking that if I do rush \"out there\" to get my perceived needs met, the worst that could happen is that I'll end up in another corner of my \"forgiveness classroom.\" A: First, yes, \"levels\" or \"order of needs\" refers indirectly to the notion of hierarchy of needs, a much-discussed concept in psychology circles in the 1960s.",
    "output": "In this important section \"The Illusions of Need\" (T-1.VI) Jesus is helping us begin the process of realizing that what needs correction in our lives is not what we perceive to be lacking--a relationship, money, health, etc.--but our misbelief, which he defines as our sense of separation from God: \"A sense of separation from God is the only lack you really need correct. This sense of separation would never have arisen if you had not distorted your perception of truth, and had thus perceived yourself as lacking\" (T-1.VI.2:1-2). This is where the miracle or forgiveness comes in, as it is the miracle or forgiveness that undoes our distorted perceptions of ourselves. As you observe, we should not deny our bodily needs while we still perceive ourselves to be bodies living in space and time. To deny our needs would not advance us spiritually at all, and as is often the case, it would tend to make things worse. To indulge ourselves in having our bodily needs met is certainly not sinful or wrong, and we should not judge ourselves for having gone in that direction. It simply delays the healing process that leads us to a state of peace. When we become aware of what we have done, we are, as you say, simply in another corner of our forgiveness classroom. Thus, since our experience is external--i.e., bodily--that is where the correction needs to be applied. We believe forgiveness needs to be expressed from one body to another, \"from the bottom up.\" Only later in our learning do we understand that the correction and the error occur only on the level of the mind. The world of time and space, of bodies, life, and death, are simply shadowy projections of the ego's thought system. Asking help of Jesus brings us awareness of the mind's causative function. Then we are able to undo the thought (or belief) that is the problem, replacing separation with Atonement, attack with forgiveness, the ego with God."

I recently heard someone make a loose comparison between the Course and Buddhist mind-training, in that both have the main goal of altering the student's perceptions through their repeated practices. So, it would seem the foundation of the Course (or text) is only to help the student understand why such practicing is necessary. In other words, trying to understand the Course intellectually through study of the text and other means only serves to help refresh one's sense of context once they have committed themselves to its mind-training, and doesn't actually further enlightenment in itself. Is that correct? A: Neither the text nor the workbook stands alone; together they comprise the spiritual path of A Course in Miracles, as the introduction to the workbook explains: \"A theoretical foundation such as the text provides is necessary as a framework to make the exercises in this workbook meaningful. Yet it is doing the exercises that will make the goal of the course possible. An untrained mind can accomplish nothing. It is the purpose of this workbook to train your mind to think along the lines the text sets forth\" (W-in.1). Thus, an understanding of the Course's metaphysics and general principles would ground the lessons so that their full meaning could be better integrated in their practice. Moreover, doing the exercises without ever studying the text, although not wrong and not without some benefit, can actually be misleading in terms of knowing what the Course is really about. We would agree that the study of the text in itself does not lead to enlightenment, if the focus is solely on the text as a conceptual thought system. On the other hand, however, the text of A Course in Miracles is not the typical text book devoted exclusively to the systematic presentation of theory. Written more along the lines of a symphony with themes and variations, the text",

There are many profound, deeply meaningful, and moving passages in the text that can engage the mind open to spiritual transformation. Of course, not all readers would respond positively to its teachings, as they are not compatible with traditional biblical teachings and practices. Yet, for those who relate to its message, there often are transformative experiences of the loving source of the message they are reading. Such instants usually initiate a life-long process that advances through the application and generalization of the principles, which is the aim of the workbook exercises."

I see friends and coworkers going about their lives improving themselves, going back to school for another graduate degree or planning trips to interesting places, and I can't find that enthusiasm in myself for much of anything. Today I noticed that I felt \"left out\" of things, like I was watching life from the sidelines. At times I have tried joining in, but I can't quite get into it like I used to. Much of the time I feel quiet inside and happy for others. Yet, at other times I find myself searching for something to throw myself into. There is a kind of desperate quality to the search. Could what I'm experiencing be an example of the \"period of undoing\" referred to in the manual for teachers? Is it expected to go back and forth between peacefulness and agitation? A: What you describe is very common with students who have been studying and practicing the Course for a while. You will notice some parallels in Questions #599, #971, and #1115; and you may find our discussions there supportive as you work through this phase of your spiritual journey. More than likely you are experiencing the effects of your willingness to undo your ego. When you are driven to find something in the world to throw yourself into, you probably are responding to a sense of lack and emptiness coming from your decision to let go of your ego. Shifting away from what you have identified with and valued all your life (W-pI.133) understandably can result in fear and panic, along with peace and relief because you are no longer fighting against the truth of who you are. So it is quite normal to feel desperate at times and then attempt to quell the storm by dropping another anchor in the familiar world. Moreover, as you shift your attention from the outer world to the inner, you would naturally feel different about the activities that formerly gave you pleasure, satisfaction, happy anticipation, etc. You are no longer firmly grounded in that world--a good thing!--but you are not yet firmly grounded in the inner world, and as a result, you would tend to feel suspended between the two. As you settle into your new role of being a happy learner (T-14.II), however, you will find that there is a way to engage in activities without the highs and lows that characterized your participation before. Once you give your day the single purpose of being a classroom in which to learn the lessons that would help you awaken from the dream, you will find yourself simply doing the things you need to do, but with less intensity and more peace. You can still enjoy television and movies, traveling, sports, or anything else that has been part of your life, but there would be a different feel to those experiences now. You have to do something; you have to eat something; you have to take care of your body; you have to interact with people, and so on; but you would go about everything differently now, in the sense that you would not take any of it as seriously as you used to. You would try to see all of your interactions",
    "output": "as the means of learning that we all share the same interests. This would actually make your interactions more meaningful--even exciting, from the point of view of knowing this is helping you on your path back to God. The form of your activities would thus come to express the content in your mind. Your friends might not notice any difference, other than that you are more peaceful and light-hearted (W-pI.155.1), but you will be experiencing everything in your life from a new perspective, having chosen a new teacher who will help you see and judge everything through his eyes. Finally, as you continue this process of forgiveness, the bouncing back and forth between your wrong and right mind will become less and less of a disturbance as you recognize the connection between undoing your ego and remembering to laugh at the \"tiny, mad idea\" (T-27.VIII.6:2). Your fear and resistance will become familiar to you and not be more than minor detours from which you will calmly find your way back to your chosen path and teacher."

    "text_input": "Q #1343: Let go my ego! That's how I feel sometimes. I have been studying A Course in Miracles for about two years, and it seems the ego is very clever at using the Course in its own favor to set me up to remain guilty. Recently I have done several things that leave me with a lot of guilt that could hurt me and my family if I continue to hold this guilt and buy into the illusion. I think I may be depending on alcohol and sex outside of a committed relationship (which is causing me much pain). I tell myself I'm not going to go out with these friends or drink anymore, but I have asked Jesus to look at this with me and I do have peace when I truly allow that. When I'm not peaceful, I live in horror of getting an STD or ruining the relationship I have with my children's father whom I live with. When I drink I lose my judgment (how ironic is that?). It is such an escape for me. Is this a normal process in learning the course? A: The ego's goal is to maintain the reality of guilt in our minds, which would then maintain our belief in the reality of our existence as separate individuals apart from God. Therefore, when we identify with the ego (our wrong minds), we would be attracted to guilt and then do the very things that would cause us to feel guilty (T-19.IV-A.i). This guilt must always be projected in the form of attacking our own bodies (illnesses, addictions, etc.) or other people's (outright physical assault, judgment, condemnation, etc.). Understanding this dynamic is one thing; but to undo our investment in our ego identification is a process that usually takes many, many years of hard work, as our fear of letting go of the ego is much more intense than we at first realize. Sometimes this process can be facilitated by turning to professional therapeutic sources in the world when destructive behavior continues with no change, despite clear awareness of its harmful consequences. Moreover, turning to a professional for help fits in nicely with the gentleness of the Course's approach to the healing of our minds and is even encouraged (see, for example, T-2.IV.4,5). Making progress on the behavioral level would reflect our mind's choice to let go of our investment in the ego thought system and accept instead the loving and peaceful correction in our right minds. Once the behavior is under control, then the principles of the Course can be practiced more effectively. In his ever gentle and patient guidance, Jesus never wants us to fight against ourselves (T-30.I.1) since he assures us that his love for us is unconditional and awaits only our acceptance of it as our fear subsides. He therefore asks us to be patient and gentle with ourselves, accepting help on the level where it is most immediately needed.",

    "text_input": "Q #1344: From the perspective of A Course in Miracles, how does one deal with a chronic health situation where there is the experience of continual physical discomfort and disruption of one's day to day life. Say that person is able to see the illness as the result of his/her own wrong choices in mind and has earnest willingness to choose again, and seeks to forgive themselves for that wrong choice. How does one proceed if there is no available known medical treatment for relief? What would be the kindest, gentlest way of forgiving oneself in this scenario, and how does one even begin to look past continual physical discomfort and/or pain to find peace when there is not even a \"magic\" solution to provide the illusion of momentary relief? A: The situation you describe is extremely trying, and we certainly hope that some form of medical help will turn up for you soon. It is terribly difficult to be in a peaceful state when your body is wracked with pain all the time, day in and day out. Forgiving yourself in this context means being kind to yourself and not dwelling on the \"wrong choice\" that you see as responsible for your condition. It is a given that the choice to see oneself as justifiably guilty is the cause of all physical conditions, whether a sprained wrist or an inoperable brain tumor--there is no hierarchy of illusions. But practically no one is directly in touch with that choice so as to evaluate and change it to a right-minded choice. It is also entirely possible that one has chosen a physical condition for right-minded reasons: for example, to demonstrate the body's irrelevance to the experience of God's Love and peace, or that one's identity transcends bodily limitations. Moreover, since we cannot see our own or anyone else's full Atonement path, we really cannot know why a specific condition exists--whether it is the result of a wrong-minded or right- minded choice--and so we best not attempt to judge it. What the Course teaches us is to ask for help in learning that our suffering cannot affect the peace of God within us. Even if we are only able to say the words, that is enough to start the healing process (see W-pII.284). Most people do not immediately experience any change in the symptoms, but we need to resist the temptation to conclude therefore that \"it's not working!\" The willingness always works, because the real sickness (separation) is only in our minds, and therefore healing takes place only at that level. The call for help underlying sickness is always being answered by the reflection of Heaven's love in our minds, and so we need only, in an act of kindness toward ourselves, acknowledge the truth of that, and then rest in the confidence that when we are ready, we will accept it into our conscious awareness. To judge ourselves because we seem not to be ready is to give support to the ego's aim of keeping guilt real in our minds. When our mind is free of guilt, our body's condition would no longer be the focal point of our attention. But this is a process that requires daily practice, usually for an extended period of time: \"The resistance to recognizing this is enormous, because the existence of the world as you perceive it depends entirely on the body being the decision maker\" (M-5.II.1:7). We cannot fail to get to this level, however, because it is the natural state of our minds, as Jesus reminds us: \"Love is your safety. Fear does not exist. Identify with love, and you are safe. Identify with love, and you are home. Identify with love, and find your Self\" (W-pII.5.5:4-8). Supportive discussions of sickness and healing may be found in Questions #1045, and #1111.",

I think the text said that if we see but one brother sinless we will attain enlightenment?",

Thus, our work as students of A Course in Miracles entails undoing our mistaken beliefs about who we truly are: the denial of our denial of the truth (T-12.II.1:5). In this forgiveness process we first look at our need to see each other as sinful in order to establish our own innocence; then we withdraw that projection, which is followed by the next step of letting go of our perception of ourselves as sinful and guilt- ridden. At that stage, all that remains in our minds is the healed perception wherein we see everyone as sharing perfectly in the pure innocence of Christ. That is enlightenment, until the last step, when God lifts us back unto Himself (W-pI.168.3)."

    "text_input": "Q #1346: Is a relationship worth pursuing when one partner seems contented, the other deeply unhappy for many years, with constant doubts about the suitability of the other person as a partner. I understand completely your response to a similar question: \"Salvation is not found in form, because nothing external to the mind has any effect on it. This is the direct opposite to the ego's belief that salvation/happiness, and relief from the misery of separation can be found in the world. This explains the ego's endless and exhausting search for solutions, changes, and improvements in everything from a house to a relationship, in an attempt to fix the problem where it is not.\" Even when a person accepts that their interpretation of the relationship is a consequence of their ego's perception and not the Holy Spirit's, and even if a person invites the Holy Spirit to help to heal their perception of this relationship, can't the relationship just be \"wrong\" for them? If not, then is it the case that any relationship will do as long as the Holy Spirit is involved in it? I can see that you would say \"yes\" to that last question, because we are One Mind and so it probably doesn't make a difference who we are in relationships with. But when it seems that two people just don't seem to really click, what then? A: When your mind is healed, it would not matter with whom you live, where you live, or what you do, for you would no longer have a self with ego needs to be satisfied, and your identity would have no roots in the world at all. Without ego needs, you would simply be the extension of love that responds to people at their level, whatever that may be. \"Clicking\" with another person would have meaning only in terms of content, not form; and in that sense, a healed mind would click with everyone because everyone is seen as the same. Until you reach that egoless state, however, it is important to respect your needs and not force yourself to stay in a relationship or do anything just because you think it is the spiritual thing to do. That really would not advance you spiritually, and it would be hard to avoid resentment if you intentionally remain in circumstances that seem to demand sacrifice of you. It is not wrong to want to be with someone you perceive to be compatible on the level of form. Within the dream, it is perfectly normal to have preferences, which means you would prefer to be with some",

    "text_input": "Q #1347: Why would agnostics from a country like Japan, where there is very little interest in organized religion and certainly little fear of God in the tradition of the three Abrahamic religions, split off in the first place from their Source? If we are all hiding from a wrathful God by creating this world and this body, how about people who don't fear or care about any God?",
    "output": "It is difficult for our minds to ask questions that don't come from premises such as the world is real and is populated by different people with different beliefs and philosophies, each existing at a very specific time in a very specific space. Certainly, this is our experience, identified as we are with these individual selves that seem to have their own individual existences, relatively unrelated and unaffected by most other separate selves in the world. From the Course's perspective, these premises could not be further from the truth. The world is merely the unitary projection of a fragmented, split mind that believes it can exist outside the Oneness of Reality (T-18.I.4-6). There are many different forms the various aspects of this split mind assume as they seem to be projected out into a world of form, but there is one thing they all share in common--they all symbolize the belief that separation is real and that we are each alone in the world, not quite sure how we have ended up here, but each quite sure that we are here. And the world will at times be experienced as a potentially dangerous, menacing place, either because of impersonal forces of nature or because of more powerful personal forces--other people--outside ourselves. So no matter what our conscious religious or spiritual beliefs, or lack of, the fact that we all seem to find ourselves in a world of separation, identified with our own body, means that we all share the same ego thought system. And we all are therefore unconsciously using the world to hide from our own guilt over believing we are separate, projected on to some force outside ourselves. So it does not matter whether we consciously believe in any god or not, we all believe in the ego and its defenses. And we have accepted the seeming defense that the world and the body provide so that we don't seem to be responsible for all the sin and guilt and fear in the split mind, which everyone who believes he is in the world shares. A Course in Miracles, as a set of symbols, is very culture-specific and so it may not resonate with those who seem to embrace a different set of cultural beliefs about the nature and existence of God and the world. The Course's specific mythology is merely derived from the rich mythology of Judaism and Christianity. But its content is universal, for it describes--in Judaeo- Christian terminology or form--what every mind that believes it is a body in the world ultimately believes. And so ultimately, each seemingly separate fragmentary aspect of the split mind must come to the realization that it is not separate from Love and its guilt over separation is not real, although the symbols that lead to this realization will differ widely throughout the Sonship (M-29.2:6)."

    "text_input": "Q #1348: Chapter 1 of A Course in Miracles says: \"This is a course in mind training. All learning involves attention and study at some level. Some of the later parts of the course rest too heavily on these earlier sections not to require their careful study. You will also need them for preparation. Without this, you may become much too fearful of what is to come to make constructive use of it ... Some of the later steps in this course, however, involve a more direct approach to God Himself. It would be unwise to start on these steps without careful preparation, or awe will be confused with fear, and the experience will be more traumatic than beatific\" (T- 1.VII.4:1-5; 5:7-8). The above quote implies that doing the Course could in certain ways turn out to be more traumatic than helpful. How seriously should we take the above \"warning\" from the Course's author to properly prepare before we start the later parts of the Course, and how would we know that we are indeed \"properly prepared\" in order not to fall into the trap of confusing \"fear with awe\"? For instance, if we study the first few chapters of the Course, when would we know that we should move on in the text and/or move perhaps on to the workbook? Aren't the first few chapters so abstract that it is indeed difficult to understand them before the rest of the Course? What am I missing here?",
    "output": "The two paragraphs you are referring to did not originally come at the end of Chapter 1. They were part of a longer message to Helen and Bill in which Jesus stressed the importance of studying the material he was giving them (see Absence from Felicity, first edition, pp. 251-52; second edition, pp. 258-59). In one sense, this would be true of any teacher-student relationship--the teacher would urge the students to study what is being taught. Since the curriculum of A Course in Miracles involves mind training, it would be important to apply oneself diligently to the study of the material in order to be prepared for later stages in the mind training that build on the earlier ones. Jesus essentially is talking about approaching God and experiencing His Love. We have many layers of defenses \"protecting\" us from the experience of God, lest we lose our cherished sense of independent existence. Therefore, the early phases of study and training establish a foundation for this process, and begin it in ways that we can tolerate without falling into a disabling panic. This prepares us for subsequent phases that bring us closer to the experience that we originally rejected and still reject in our choice to be separate and autonomous individuals. We need to become acquainted with the thought system we will be undoing and have some idea of the obstacles we have placed in our way, otherwise we will not be able to properly process what happens after the phase of undoing. That is why Jesus wants us to study the material carefully. By \"carefully\" he would mean that we realize that he is speaking directly to us as we experience ourselves now. He is not simply presenting a series ideas and concepts that we can approach in an impersonal way. He wants us to get used to thinking about ourselves as he describes us in his course. Thus, it is more of an attitude toward your study, not so much comprehension of everything he is saying in these first few chapters. As you have observed, there are parts of these chapters (and all of the remaining chapters for that matter) that are difficult to understand, but he does not expect us to grasp every word and all of the implications of the ideas. That is why he comes back to the basic principles over and over and restates them in different ways throughout the three books. Thus, the aim is not intellectual mastery of the text, but rather, combined with a serious attempt to understand the thought system he is unfolding, that we recognize that we are embarking on a journey with him that will eventually penetrate deeply into areas of our lives and minds that we have sought to keep concealed. This is best done slowly and with a growing awareness that there is a loving, comforting presence within us inviting us to hold his hand every step of the way so that the journey will lead to a beatific experience. Finally, it is helpful to remember that \"the curriculum is highly individualized\" (M-29.2:6). Therefore, with regard to when to begin the workbook lessons, trust what you feel and don't force anything. There is no right or wrong in such matters."

    "text_input": "Q #1349: I have a question regarding the following quotes from the text that refer to God/the Holy Spirit and the Course confronting us with our separated world and ego.",
    "output": "\"You are in an impossible situation only because you think it is possible to be in one. You would be in an impossible situation if God showed you your perfection, and proved to you that you were wrong. This would demonstrate that the perfect are inadequate to bring themselves to the awareness of their perfection, and thus side with the belief that those who have everything need help and are therefore helpless\" (T-6.IV.10:1-3). \"What would be gained if God proved to you that you have thought insanely? ... If He confronted the self you made with the truth He created for you, what could you be but afraid? You would doubt your right mind, which is the only place where you can find the sanity He gave you\" (T-6.IV.11:5,9-10). I understand that \"God does not teach\" and He does not prove to us that we have thought insanely. However, isn't that exactly what A Course in Miracles is trying to do, prove to us that we are indeed NOT living in a real world and are NOT separate from God? Isn't the Course, thereby, putting us into an impossible situation and contradicting itself grossly in this respect? What am I misperceiving? Will we not indeed start to \"doubt the only place where God put His sanity,\" being \"taught\" that we are indeed NOT apart from the divine? Could this perhaps be the reason I have sometimes felt that the Course is \"impossible to do\"--not from an emotional but from a logical point of view? A: Being asked to undo what never happened is indeed a paradox, if not a pretty good koan. And yes, the Course often does send our logic-driven intellects into shock, while also revealing to us the strict logic of the thought system that has compelled our belief and commitment, deluding us into thinking insanity is sanity. On the one hand, if God Himself were to communicate our wrongness and insanity to us directly, we could not but conclude that our existence apart from Him is somehow real and that we should indeed be afraid of the consequences of what we have done. On the other hand, though, our experience is that we are alive here as separate and apart from God, but that something is dreadfully wrong with that. What appears as A Course in Miracles is really an answer to this call for help that emanates from deep inside us. Yes, the Course is telling us that the world is not real and that we are not separate from God--only in an illusion could this be so, but in truth, there can't even be an illusion of separation. We thus are confronted with our massive self-deception, but we are given the means of dealing with the underlying fear that inevitably rises to the surface when we connect with this message. We are taught that guilt and fear are not justified in the face of our now-exposed plot to hide what we have conceived of as our treachery and covered over with our \"face of innocence.\" But it is not God Who exposes our deception, because God could not respond to what does not exist. A part of our own minds has chosen to question its own operating system, and the teachings of the Course symbolize this process going on in our own minds of questioning, asking for help, re-evaluating, and finally choosing to correct what is now seen as but a faulty choice, which never actually happened in reality. The Course is written on a high intellectual level, as many have observed, and many others have bemoaned. Yet, there is a point in our work with the Course at which our intellects are seen to be part of the problem, as they serve primarily to sustain our self-perception as autonomous beings, capable of recognizing and solving problems to preserve our species and even the universe itself. Our intellects can take us only so far with the process of healing our minds because they function essentially in the realm of duality, and as many mystics have said, the intellect must be transcended in order to experience God directly. All this is a way of saying that there are no satisfactory intellectual answers to some of the questions that naturally arise as we delve into the Course's teachings. Our difficulties point back to what we have done to ourselves: \"When you made visible what is not true, what is true became invisible to you\" (T-12.VIII.3:1). \"To you the miracle cannot seem natural, because what you have done to hurt your mind has made it so unnatural that it does not remember what is natural to it. And when you are told what is natural, you cannot understand it\" (T-16.II.3:1-2). Finally, there is that statement that many students have found frustrating and quite humbling, where Jesus gently pokes us in our intellects and says: \"You are still convinced that your understanding is a powerful contribution to the truth, and makes it what it is. Yet we have emphasized that you need understand nothing. Salvation is easy just because it asks nothing you cannot give right now\" (T-18.IV.7:5-7). What this comes down to is balancing our intellectual efforts with the humble recognition that we cannot get ourselves out of the mess we got ourselves into without help from outside our familiar thought system. We thus use our intellects to get beyond our intellects. We learn to trust the inner Presence that symbolizes the restoration of our minds to the state of pure Oneness with our Source."

Any suggestions, or is this how it's supposed to be. A: What you describe sounds very much like what most students go through, as you can tell from the number of questions submitted on this subject: see, for example, Questions #533, #730, #843, #1015, #1028, and #1182.",
    "output": "Seventeen years may seem like a long time, but that judgment would come from our very limited perspective and therefore should not be taken seriously. Moreover, how long your journey takes is not important because time is irrelevant to a process that takes place outside time and space. What is important is that you continue to be gentle and patient, and that you not force yourself to take steps you do not feel ready to take. Just do the best you can. Quite often, our fear of letting go of our ego identity is so intense that we need to take a break and set the Course aside for a while, and there is nothing wrong with that as long as there is no judgment involved. Fear is not a sin, and fear is usually at the root of all resistance to the practice of forgiveness and letting go of our identification with our special, bodily selves. That is the essence of many of the discussions you will find in the questions mentioned above. Sometimes students find it helpful to have a few favorite passages at hand when they get bogged down--as reminders that Jesus' trust in us is unconditional, yet he knows we will be resisting his message and that our trust in him is not yet unconditional, but we at least would like it to be. It is reassuring to remember when the going gets rough: \"You think you are destroyed, but you are saved\" (W-pI.93.4:4); \"Have faith in only this one thing, and it will be sufficient: God wills you be in Heaven, and nothing can keep you from it, or it from you. Your wildest misperceptions, your weird imaginings, your blackest nightmares all mean nothing. They will not prevail against the peace God wills for you\" (T-13.XI.7:1-3)."

Can I continue being this even if it is an authority problem, or does Jesus ask that we give up any self-assertion even if it causes us fear do so?",
    "output": "Jesus never asks us to sacrifice anything for the sake of spiritual advancement. Only the ego's God and Jesus demand sacrifice. What Jesus wants us to do is develop the habit of asking of our values and behavior, \"What is it for? What purpose does this serve?\" He wants us to become more and more aware that we are decision-making minds always making one of two choices: either to continue to be separate from God and others or to undo our belief in separation and learn that we all share the same interests and ultimately the same Identity. That is the only relevant meaning of what we do and think. Thus, if you were to evaluate the behavior you are referring to in this context of its purpose, you might attain a better understanding of what is going on. This would shift your attention from your behavior to your mind, and you would realize that your salvation does not rest on making changes on the behavioral level. Self-assertion is an ego ideal, although it is not necessarily wrong to go through a stage of self- assertion as a correction for years of doing the opposite. When you choose Jesus or the Holy Spirit as your internal Teacher, rather than the ego, you will be centered in the love that responds to everything and everyone only with love and kindness. This content in your mind would then be expressed appropriately in the circumstances of your life, which may be in the form of assertiveness, but not the ego version that would reinforce differences and lead to an adversarial relationship. If you focus on being clear about the purpose you are choosing in your mind, your behavior would just flow from that, and then you would not be in conflict. There would be a consistency between your thoughts and behavior--what Jesus calls \"honesty,\" the second characteristic of God's teachers (see M-4.II). A Course in Miracles, actually, says nothing about what our behavior ought to be. Finally, from the information you have given, it is difficult to determine whether your problem is simply an authority issue. We all would tend to have issues with authorities, given the fact that we believe we got our existence at God's expense and that He is after us to punish us and get back what we took from Him.

I ask the Holy Spirit for help before deciding to sell a vehicle with problems, but it seems like I have made decisions before asking for help. It would be impossible to correct all problems with the car I'm selling without experiencing a great financial burden, so the solution is an auction, where there is a greater possibility of selling, or selling \"as is\" and recovering at least some of the loss. It seems impossible to have a holy encounter with a brother you're going to victimize. A change of professions would be my choice, but meanwhile, these situations always creep up. Could this be a situation of committing a sin and then atoning for it? I want my actions to be reflections of love rather than symbols of attack, but the opposite happens every time. Could you help with a formula for looking at this with God's help and not the ego? A: A Course in Miracles would never call anything we do a sin, only a mistake, and the mistake would be in the choice we make in our minds to listen to the ego and make sin and guilt real, which leads to the projection of our guilt in the form of attack on ourselves or someone else. These dynamics involve deflecting responsibility for what we do and finding some way of justifying it: \"It wasn't my fault. It's just business.\" The ego's God believes in sin and atonement for sin through suffering, sacrifice, and punishment. Jesus teaches us in the Course, however, that the true meaning of Atonement is the undoing of our belief in separation. God knows not of sin, and He does not forgive because He has never condemned (W-pI.46.1:1). There is a nice discussion of Atonement in #856. There is no real formula to give you, but it might help you just to look calmly at the thought system that underlies your view of your job and your relationship with buyers. This thought system of separation rests on the principles of one or the other and kill or be killed. Getting what we want comes at another's expense--someone would always have to lose in this system. Jesus therefore asks us to look honestly at how we justify what we do and feel, but not to judge ourselves for it. We can then ask for help to look at the situation differently--not through the ego's one or the other view, but through Jesus' eyes that see us all as the same. You are already caught in your wrong mind if you see a brother as someone you are about to victimize, someone who must lose so you can win. Again, this is a matter of the content in your mind, not your behavior, so that is the instant when you would acknowledge that you are in your wrong mind and therefore nothing that you do would be loving. The willingness to see the situation differently will help you shift to your right mind. What this is saying is that you can be a right-minded used-car dealer! You would not lie, and you would not withhold information from the buyer. You would present the car in a positive way, meaning you would believe in the car you are selling. There is a relevant passage in the text that nicely fits your situation: \"A good teacher must believe in the ideas he teaches, but he must meet another condition; he must believe in the students to whom he offers the ideas\" (T-4.I.1:4). If you can orient yourself this way, you will feel good about yourself, the buyer, and the transaction, and then the conflict would disappear and you would be peaceful. You might even",

    "text_input": "Q #1353: I wonder about gratitude and its usefulness in practicing A Course in Miracles. Other Course friends frequently bring up the practice of gratitude as being very helpful to them and how they feel. I'm not really sure what I'm to be grateful for as a Course student. I do feel grateful when I experience relief from fear or pain, joy in relationship to another, the experience of peace. But, can this be a tool? Or is it an effect? I am bothered when I hear people say that the practice of gratitude has changed their whole perception of a situation. A: Gratitude is integral to the practice of the Course. This is particularly evident from a study of the workbook lesson \"Love is the way I walk in gratitude\" (W-pI.195). There Jesus contrasts the world's view of gratitude, which reflects the ego's strategy to keep us separate, with the Course's view, which reflects \"the Love which is the Source of all creation\" (W-pI.195.10:3).",
    "output": "On our Web site, under Learning Aids/Excerpts, we have posted the edited transcript of a workshop Ken presented called \"Our Gratitude to God.\" We refer you to that series for an in- depth discussion of this important dimension of the healing of our minds. As with most of the concepts addressed in the Course, gratitude is approached first from the ego's point of view and then from the corrected perspective in our right minds. Our resistance to being grateful is also considered. Briefly stated, our gratitude is threefold: 1) to God for sharing everything of Himself with us in our creation; 2) to Jesus who is present to us as a brother helping us to remember God; 3) for all the circumstances and people in our lives, for they form the classroom in which we learn to awaken from our dream of fear. If we are honest with ourselves we would recognize within us some rather strenuous resistance to these levels of gratitude. This would have to be the case considering the thought system from which our individualized existence emanates: The ego basically said to God, \"Who needs You? I can make it on my own. Watch me!\" This underlying attitude is present in the minds of everyone, and therefore to the extent that we value our independence and autonomy we would find very little justification for being grateful to God for creating us. This would also have to be true of our relationship with Jesus, as he symbolizes the Love of God for us. Being grateful would conflict with our unconscious need to prove that we can make something of our lives on our own. We might need some help from others now and then, but the ideal held out to us, especially in this country, is self-reliance and independence. \"I did it my way,\" as the popular song proclaims. What all of this means is that before we can experience true gratitude, we must look at the ingratitude we feel and what it represents, which is basically valuing separation. As we recognize the pain associated with that, we can turn to the loving, gentle teacher within, who will look at it with us. Choosing against all else but that love, \"our gratitude will pave the way to Him, and shorten our learning time by more than [we] could ever dream of\" (W-pI.195.10:1)."

    "text_input": "Q #1354: I am reading \"A Vast Illusion: Time According to A Course in Miracles\" and am trying to understand the idea of the observer. I think you are saying that the observer is still part of our split mind, but on another level from form. Is this correct?",
    "output": "Yes, the observer is the decision-making part of the split mind. Form, however, has to do only with the projections of the mind, the ego's way of trying to prevent us from looking at the content in the minds so that we will not remember that we have the power to change our minds about our having chosen the ego instead of the Holy Spirit. The observer, or decision maker, is thus the capacity of our mind to choose to identify either with the ego's thought system or the Holy Spirit's (see, for example, T-14.III.4). When it chooses the Holy Spirit's thought system of forgiveness, it then looks at or observes all the ego thoughts in the mind without judgment. They then begin to fade, and finally they disappear, because their nothingness becomes apparent when they are seen in the light of truth (the right mind). Your question is raised frequently by students, and so for further study, we refer you to previous discussions of this topic in the following Questions: #264, #663, #713, #715, and #814."

    "text_input": "Q #1355: Where do our individual lessons, our \"scripts,\" come from? Who, in what realm, is the part of me that has already written my script? Are our individual projections, the pictures we draw on our computer screen, the people and relationships we attract or repel, all based on what we, as separate egos, need to learn? Is that why people's life circumstances can be so different? And how do we find those that we need to play out our roles with? Is the plan we all follow a function of our higher selves or the Holy Spirit or is it more random? Somehow it seems the whole idea of forgiveness and the fact that it actually works has to do with this issue. I know the ultimate learning is to step out of the dream, no matter what it may be, and that we can choose once again, so free will obviously must come into play as well. But this is perhaps another question. Any clarification would be appreciated. A: A proper treatment of your questions, all of which are intelligent and appropriate, would require a book-length answer. Fortunately we can refer you to one authored by Ken Wapnick: A Vast Illusion: Time According to \"A Course in Miracles,\" and also to other Questions that have addressed some of these issues: for example, #266, #489, #935, #1014, #1109, and #1141.We also have audio material available that you might find helpful: \"From Time to Timelessness,\" \"The Time Machine,\" \"The Metaphysics of Time.\"",
    "output": "One caution to keep in mind as you probe this intriguing subject is that our intellects can take us only so far, because our reference point is the limited one of linear time and space, and the mind's process occurs outside time and space, beyond our intellects. Jesus reminds us of this in one of his discussions about our journey: \"There is no need to further clarify what no one in the world can understand. When revelation of your oneness comes, it will be known and fully understood. Now we have work to do, for those in time can speak of things beyond, and listen to words which explain what is to come is past already. Yet what meaning can the words convey to those who count the hours still, and rise and work and go to sleep by them?\" (W-pI.169.10) It is understandable that we would want to know how everything works, but because we have denied our identity as minds and taken on a limited bodily identity instead, it is vexedly difficult for us to understand what Jesus is telling us about our mind's process. In essence, we are trying to understand something a part of us does not want us to go anywhere near, because the very foundation of our existence as we know it would be profoundly shaken if we did. The Course is saying that by following the ego's strategy, we wound up in a state of mindlessness, and it is from there that we are attempting to understand mind. Jesus assures us, however, that our questions will tend to diminish as we begin to have experiences of forgiveness--and that is where he would like our focus to be. We can practice forgiveness without fully grasping its metaphysical basis, but, as you say, some understanding of the principles on which forgiveness rests can help us with our practice. We thus use our intellects to transcend our intellects. With this in mind, we can briefly address some of your specific questions here, but for comprehensive explanations and discussions, we again recommend that you turn to the sources mentioned above. The basic premise is that at the instant the separation from God occurred (which did not occur in reality), every conceivable expression of separation spun out, and just as instantaneously, the correction for the separation spun out as well. These are our scripts--wrong- minded and right-minded--which our minds are always choosing between, based on whether we want to remain separated or change our belief in separation. Jesus talks about this metaphorically in terms of a carpet (T-13.I.3) and as a process of substitution and fragmentation that resulted in our present state of ignorance and confusion (T-18.I.4,5). Linear time is the ego's way of perpetuating sin (the past), guilt (the present), and fear (the future). The mind training in the Course aims at helping us get back to our minds and this concealed content that underlies and motivates all of our activities in the world of time and space. Thus does Jesus tell us, \"Each day, and every minute in each day, and every instant that each minute holds, you but relive the single instant when the time of terror took the place of love\" (T- 26.V.13:1). \"Life\" in a temporal-spatial universe of form is intended to keep this content hidden: \"Nothing so blinding as perception of form. For sight of form means understanding has been obscured\" (T-22.III.6:7-8). A major difficulty in comprehending this is that our experience does not square with what the Course tells us is happening. We are taught for example that we are \"reviewing mentally what has gone by\" (W-pI.158.4:5), and that \"this world was over long ago\" (T-28.I.1:6). Yet that is not our experience, and so our tendency would be to try to bring these teachings into our experience instead of trying to raise ourselves to this other level that is outside time and space, and be content with what we can comprehend at this point in our journey (T-18.IV.7:5-7). Thus, we must hear over and over and in many different ways that the world \"is the outside picture of inward condition\" (T-21.in.1:5), and that all perception \"but witnesses to what you taught. It is the outward picture of a wish; an image that you wanted to be true\" (T-24.VII.8:9-10). Some philosophers have had intimations of this, but for the most part, it feels as if we have run into an intellectual brick wall when we read these lines. These basic principles, however, should ground any discussion of time, scripts, and free will. Thus, our lives and relationships in this world reflect the choice made by our decision-making minds, not the Holy Spirit, either to keep the belief in separation going or to undo that belief. This mind is always expressing in form the content with which it has chosen to identify: the ego's or the Holy Spirit's, and therefore it is either projecting guilt or extending love. There are also collective decisions of minds that we as seeming individuals would recognize as couples, families, groups, etc. All of this flows from the desperate need of the ego to keep differences real and prominent in our experience, for only thus will the ego survive. What appear as choices we make in the world, thus, are but the effects of the thought system our minds (not our higher Self, which is not part of the illusion) have chosen to follow. That is indeed hard for us to understand and even harder to accept, but that is what the Course teaches. The exercises in the workbook lessons are geared toward facilitating this kind of thought reversal (see W-pI.11.1:1; 126.1:1; also in the manual, M-24.4:1). Jesus is always addressing this mind that has decided not to be a mind but to be instead an autonomous individual in bodily form. The circumstances of our lives constitute the curriculum which Jesus uses to redirect our focus back within so that we will re-identify with our nature, within the illusion, as decision-making minds. When we have chosen once and for all against the ego, all that remains is the selfless love that had been concealed by the wrong mind. At that point there is no longer a decision maker and the mind then is the channel through which the love flows, taking whatever form is helpful to those minds that are still in the process of healing."

    "text_input": "Q #1356: All my life I have been very troubled by the fact that I lack a burning passion for anything, or anyone. However, I do feel like I love my wife and family members (although not as much as I always thought I should) and I think that I am sensitive to the needs and feelings of other people in general, caring, good-natured and, although slightly introverted, not what I would consider antisocial or reclusive. Moreover, I have never really felt the strong sense of attachment or belonging to any institution (religious, academic, or otherwise) that I see so many other people exhibit. The general lack of passion that pervades my entire life, as well as my inability to find a \"river of interest\" (career- wise) in which I could get completely absorbed, has been a great source of angst for me. I have had multiple careers in this lifetime and I've searched incessantly over the past 15 years or so in an effort to find the meaning and purpose of my life.  Only in the past couple of months have I found A Course in Miracles. The words contained in A Course in Miracles, and other materials directly related to it, seem to resonate with me in spite of the fact that for most of my adult life I have always been very skeptical about the existence of God or the existence of anything other than what science could demonstrate as true.  Recently, feeling somewhat anxious but unable to identify a specific cause, I tried to slow down my thoughts and recall some of the passages from A Course in Miracles while asking the Holy Spirit's help to put things in perspective. After a minute or so, I had a somewhat startling thought. Perhaps my lack of attachment and lack of passion for things here are a result of me picking up where I left off in my efforts during a previous \"lifetime\" to see the illusory things in this world for what they really are. Is it possible that my inability to find real meaning in anything was \"meant\" to keep me searching until I found what I was supposed to find? Being so new to A Course in Miracles, I am unsure whether this is a rationalization or justification of the way I \"am\" in this lifetime (ego?), or if this might be a genuine flash of insight (Holy Spirit?). I would greatly appreciate your thoughts on this.",
    "output": "We cannot evaluate anyone's inner experiences, but since you were startled by the thought, it would seem that it is somehow an answer to your seeking. It could well be that you are picking up where you left off in a previous lifetime in this sense: \"Trials are but lessons that you failed to learn presented once again, so where you made a faulty choice before you now can make a better one, and thus escape all pain that what you chose before has brought to you\" (T-31.VIII.3:1). In processing this, it is crucial to remember the Course's teaching that our minds function outside time and space, and that linear time is a primary device the ego uses to keep us from connecting with our identity as decision-making minds so we would never uncover the true nature of our problems. This is the meaning behind Jesus saying, \"Each day, and every minute in each day, and every instant that each minute holds, you but relive the single instant when the time of terror took the place of love\" (T-26.V.13:1). Jesus is describing the content in our minds which we, as minds, keep well out of awareness by being preoccupied with bodily existence in the world. The key part of this is that we are always denying and then projecting what is going on in our minds so that it appears as if our problems are rooted in the world, including our own bodies. This means we are living a lie by believing we are really here in the world, not of our own choosing, and that our existence here is significant and meaningful. Guilt must result, as long as we continue to repress this massive self-deception. The anxiety you are experiencing could be related to the guilt that would be triggered over being exposed as living a lie. Ultimately, this is good, as the insight probably came from the sane part of you that is inviting you to make another choice and end your opposition to God and your true Self. The buried guilt over setting up an existence in opposition to God and your true Self could manifest itself in a lack of passion for anything or anyone, in the sense that deep within you would know that its real purpose is to give truth to a lie. Partial commitment would thus protect you from even further guilt, reflecting the gnawing suspicion that God will surely punish you (all of us) for setting up a personal existence at the expense of His Love and Oneness. From another point of view, you would know that you don't really belong here and so you would be very reluctant to throw yourself into anything wholeheartedly. There is no real \"fit,\" as Jesus poignantly describes in Lesson 182: \"This world you seem to live in is not home to you. And somewhere in your mind you know that this is true ... We speak today for everyone who walks this world, for he is not at home. He goes uncertainly about in endless search, seeking in darkness what he cannot find; not recognizing what it is he seeks. A thousand homes he makes, yet none contents his restless mind\" (W-pI.182.1:1-2; 3:1-3). The Course offers us a way out of this painful dilemma by teaching us that the Holy Spirit can use what we made to harm to heal our minds of their mistaken beliefs. Thus, \"The body was not made by love. Yet love does not condemn it and can use it lovingly, respecting what the Son of God has made and using it to save him from illusions\" (T-18.VI.4:7-8). The world and our lives now become classrooms in which, by choosing the right inner teacher, we learn the lessons that will lead us out of this nightmare of separation from God. Forgiveness is the means to this end. Giving your relationships and roles this purpose will supply the deeper meaning for which you yearn, and as you progress, you will feel much more connected to people, for you will be parting the veil that has hidden your oneness with everyone as God's beloved Son. Being on such a journey is truly joyous. \"Learn to be a happy learner\" (T-14.II.5:3)."

    "text_input": "Q #1357: In the text of A Course in Miracles Jesus tells us to ask him before we perform a miracle (T-1.III.4:3). I don't understand what I would do that would require me to ask Jesus if I should do it. Is there another process that I will be doing in the future that I don't understand yet?",
    "output": "The central theme of the early principles and the first chapter in the text that you refer to is that miracles shift our perception, and that is why they heal. The focus of our attention, however, is almost always on our bodies-- our planning and activities almost always center on what is good or not good for bodies. Therefore, right at the beginning of the text Jesus begins to train us to focus differently--not on our bodies, but on the choices we are making in our minds, because those choices are the root of both our problems and their solution. Later he thus urges us, \"Seek not to change the world, but choose to change your mind about the world\" (T-21.in.1:7). The primary means of changing our focus from the external to the internal in the early stages of our work with the Course is to learn to ask Jesus' help before we act. This gradually gets us out of the habit of assuming we know what is best for ourselves and others--that we know which miracles to perform, in other words. Thus, it is not so much about doing something, but about gradually learning to focus on the purpose we have chosen in our minds for what we are doing. Jesus is teaching us that what we do is not important in terms of our spiritual journey; it is the choice of teacher we have made in our minds to guide us in what we do that is important. That choice, and that choice alone, is what will keep us asleep in the dream of separation from God or help us realize that we are the dreamers of that dream, which will eventually lead us to awaken from it entirely."

    "text_input": "Q #1358: From what I gather, \"ego ideals\" are part of the level-confusion issue: I think that if I'm a \"good\" person and do \"good\" things, the Holy Spirit will look on me more favorably, or I'll be more \"advanced\"; on the flip side, if I \"waste\" my time watching basketball on TV or I treat someone poorly, the opposite terms apply. In this case, there's usually fuel for thinking myself guilty, and this is where the harder part comes in. It's obvious that on the level of behavior we have so many decisions to make, and some aren't morally good: If I decide to skip a meeting I know I should be at but feel is utterly unimportant, I feel the lack of integrity in myself, create the guilt that I project onto the Holy Spirit thinking I'm guilty and undeserving of peace, as though my skipping the meeting is part of the spiritual landscape. From what I'm understanding, skipping the meeting is not the issue, but instead it's that I have done all this unconsciously to create guilt by using the \"ego ideal\" as a defense against love? Another example: my parents are taking my family on vacation to a place I don't really care for; plus it'll be crowded and crazy. I'm planning on not going but spending some time alone, etc. My wife has no problem with this, and though I know my parents might frown some, I have made it into a big deal, as though there's a right moral choice: I should go to fulfill my duty and be a good son. Same thing as the meeting, right? Or am I in denial?",
    "output": "You're on the right track, but you haven't gotten to the core of the problem yet. The \"ego ideal\" is not in itself the defense against love. It is the convenient external criterion the ego invokes and employs as a smokescreen to deceive us about why we feel guilty. But the only reason we ever feel guilty has nothing to do with anything external. It is that we have already made an internal decision to be selfish, to put our own self-interests above everyone else's, to see ourselves as separate and in need of taking care of ourselves first and everyone else be damned-- that's the core of the separation thought. And it comes from our fear of love, which denies the truth of who we are. Any decision about external events or situations that proceeds then from this internal decision for selfishness will simply reinforce and seem also to account for those feelings. But we will be deluding ourselves about the real cause. The Course's only reference to ego ideals describes their role in obscuring the source of the guilt in our mind: \"Yet consider how strange a solution the ego's arrangement is. You project guilt to get rid of it, but you are actually merely concealing it. You do experience the guilt, but you have no idea why. On the contrary, you associate it with a weird assortment of 'ego ideals,' which the ego claims you have failed. Yet you have no idea that you are failing the Son of God by seeing him as guilty. Believing you are no longer you, you do not realize that you are failing yourself\" (T- 13.II.2; italics added). The goal then is not to be able to make decisions that protect our self-interest without feeling guilty, but rather to turn to our Inner Guide whenever we feel that we have an important decision to make, so that we can be reminded of what is the truly important decision--who we make it with. Now the ego would tell us, \"Sure, turn to the Holy Spirit and you know He'll tell you that you need to do what you don't want to do\" --the ego always confuses sacrifice with love. And the ego's focus is always on behavior, or form, rather than on the mind, or content. And so morality--doing the right thing--is an ego concern. For the ego is preoccupied with rules for behavior. But the Holy Spirit is concerned only with rules for decision. In that sense we can say that the Course is an a moral thought system--it is not concerned with what we do, but only with how we think. So the guilt is not coming from the \"ego ideals,\" which would dictate the \"moral\" or \"right\" choice, but rather from that fact that you are making decisions on your own. And so, in the examples you describe, you have already made up your mind what the problem is and what you want to do before you ask for help, hoping that you can decide on your own and get what you want without guilt. The guilt however is not coming from what you are deciding to do or not to do, but from the fact that you are deciding on your own, which means with the ego (T-30.I.14). In the section of the text titled \"Rules for Decision\" Jesus says: \"This is your major problem now. You still make up your mind, and then decide to ask what you should do. And what you hear may not resolve the problem as you saw it first. This leads to fear, because it contradicts what you perceive and so you feel attacked. And therefore angry. There are rules by which this will not happen. But it does occur at first, while you are learning how to hear\" (T-30.I.3). Jesus offers the solution in the preceding paragraph: \"The outlook starts with this: Today I will make no decisions by myself. This means that you are choosing not to be the judge of what to do. But it must also mean you will not judge the situations where you will be called upon to make response. For if you judge them, you have set the rules for how you should react to them. And then another answer cannot but produce confusion and uncertainty and fear\" (T-30.I.2). In other words, the important decision is not whether to participate in a certain meeting or go with family on a special vacation, but whether you wish to have the ego or the Holy Spirit as your interpreter and guide in whatever you end up doing. And since we never know what is in our own best interests, we will never know what the \"right\" thing to do is ahead of time, regardless of the ego's \"moral\" judgments. But whatever we end up being guided to do, we will be at peace about it, because we have not decided on our own, from a belief in our own guilt and limitation and lack. And our experience then will be one of peace and joy, free of conflict and pain and guilt, regardless of what seems to be happening around us."

My understanding is that I am dissociating within the dream of dissociation, and that it is my split-off ego self that is dissociating further within the dream. It seems that I experience fear or guilt and then \"deal\" with it by dissociating further, rather than by dealing with the feelings, which are too painful to face.",
    "output": "To date, my \"solution\" has been to be extremely open with my \"unacceptable\" thoughts and feelings, sharing them with the person I am with at the time, in the hope that I would thereby dispel the \"unacceptable\" label I put on them and remain fully present in the situation. But this often only makes me feel more guilty, particularly when the \"unacceptable\" thoughts are judgmental and hurtful of that person, as they often are. Recently, it has occurred to me that the reason I dissociate around others is because I experience them as being different from myself and therefore threatening to me, and because this experience reminds me of the original difference--the one I made real between myself and God--and all the guilt and fear that I associate with this. So in avoiding others, I am trying to avoid dealing with my guilt and fear. Am I on the right track? Is it necessary that I try to deal with this disorder by spending more time around people, placing myself in situations that I find fearful, where I am likely to dissociate? Or is it enough that I ask for help to try to see others as the same as me, and to be mindful of this when I am around others? I was hesitant to ask this question, as it seems like it is fairly clinical and clearly involves a psychiatric disorder for which I have sought treatment, albeit with little improvement. I have been studying A Course in Miracles for several years and it has been the only thing that has ever truly helped me. A: Yes, you're on the right track. For all of us in fact, everyone else is a symbol of our own guilt and fear, although the form in which we may experience those feelings will be different from person to person. In addition, our own self and our body are symbols of that guilt and fear. Tracing the process from the beginning to where we find ourselves now, we first foolishly believed, as one Son, that we could dissociate ourselves from God, that is, end our association with Him so that we could be on our own. To convince ourselves that we really did it, we made guilt real in our minds, asserting that dissociation involves attack. We then had to dissociate ourselves from the guilt as well, because it seemed too painful. Each dissociation seems to create another \"other\"--someone else outside the newly defined self we see as ourselves--an other both to be feared and to feel guilty about, since they are literally made from our own denied guilt and fear. (Volume One of Kenneth Wapnick's two-volume set, The Message of A Course in Miracles, All Are Called, especially chapters 2 and 4, as well as the two audio sets, Separation and Forgiveness: The Four Splits and Their Undoing, and The Four Splits of Separation Revisited, provide more in-depth presentations of this series of dissociative steps and the projections involved). The massive dissociation in our mind that seemed to lead to a world and countless \"others\" to fear and feel guilty about was our crowning dissociative accomplishment. But the dissociative process need not stop there, as you have found, for it can seem that the self that we by consensus have defined as the final dissociation--the apparently \"stable\" individual self identified with a single body (see Questions #165 and #609 for further discussion of this process in the context of dissociative disorders)--can experience further dissociation within its arbitrarily defined limits and seem to split into more fragments. After all, there is no natural boundary within the mind-- all boundaries are unnatural! And so we live our so-called lives as separate, individual selves, believing that there are others outside ourselves who can hurt us and whom we can hurt, never realizing that we are simply looking at all of our own dissociated selves in the mirror that we self-deceptively have called the outside world. And then we either seek or avoid special relationships with others \"out there\" to help us manage and assuage the guilt we still carry within us but want to deny, never realizing that it is our own integrated, guiltless self that we all ultimately long for. But every split off part of ourselves, whether it seems to be physically separate from us or simply haunts a seemingly separate corridor of our mind, is made from our own guilt and fear. And consequently, guilt and fear are all that each dissociated part can represent or symbolize to us, so long as we remain with the teacher of dissociation and guilt and fear. Although in some respects, you're dissociative processes may seem more extreme than what most others experience, resulting in a clinical diagnosis, they really are no different. It is only because this is a world based on differences that there is a need to see only some of us as having dissociative disorders so that we never come to the recognition that we all do. The ego is very clever in this respect (see #671 for further discussion of this aspect of the ego's arsenal of deceitful tricks). In a sense, you are more aware than most of what your mind is doing, including its attempts through dissociation or compartmentalization to shut off the painful, guilty and fearful thoughts within your own mind. Of course, the problem with all of our dissociative defenses is that they do nothing about our belief in the reality of the guilt and fear--in fact, they reinforce that belief--\"All defenses do what they would defend,\" as Jesus points out (T-17.IV.7:1). And although your \"solution\" of acknowledging your unacceptable thoughts and feelings to the other person would seem to be a step in the right direction, it is not likely to work, as you have found, while the two of you both still believe in and are very much identified with the ego's thought system. The one we want to share those fearful, guilt-ridden thoughts with is Jesus, for he's the one who knows that they are not real. Now Jesus is also an \"other\" who, along with the Holy Spirit, has been dissociated from our self, but he can represent to us something other than guilt and fear if we are willing to allow him to. For while we still believe the guilt is real, we need an \"other\" who seems to be different from ourselves to remind us that we are wrong about ourselves. It is in a relationship with him that the release of our guilt and fears can be experienced, as part of an integrative process that will begin to allow us to recognize that we are all the same, first as egos who believe in the power of dissociation, and eventually as the one guiltless Son who knows there is nothing to fear, for there truly is nothing outside our Self, integrated and whole. For this process of integration, or forgiveness, to happen, it's not necessary that you seek out others who trigger your dissociations. These experiences will begin to happen as you are ready to release more of your inner guilt and fear and they can be part of a gentle process that you need not put yourself in charge of. Your part will be simply to look at your resistance to trusting that you will never be abandoned by your inner Guide as your guilt and fear arise, although you will be tempted many times to abandon Him through dissociation. And when the fear becomes too great and you find yourself falling back on familiar defenses, there is no need for self- condemnation--you simply became afraid and Jesus will never judge you for that. And over time, as your relationship with him grows, you will find that you are increasingly willing to associate your self with the love he is always holding out for you, and me, and everyone else, while we still believe there is anyone else. You mention, by the way, that you have received treatment for your condition, although it is not clear whether you are still in any kind of treatment. There certainly is nothing in the Course that would advise against therapy, and there can be real value in seeking out some form of professional help, as you continue at the same time to do your inner work. And it is not at all necessary that the therapist be familiar with A Course in Miracles. A strong background in dealing with dissociative disorders, on the other hand, would be one of the more important criteria for selecting a therapist."

We have fought about this, but I found it of no use. It was during that time I began to practice A Course in Miracles. Sometimes the Course works, and sometimes doesn't. But somehow I feel I just can't take it anymore. I am full of hatred and self-pity. I don't want to forgive him and I hate myself for doing this. I don't know what to do.",
    "output": "Being a student of A Course in Miracles does not mean that you must stay in an abusive relationship in order to practice your lessons of forgiveness. That is a mistake students often make. While it is not the purpose of the Course to advise us on behavior, it does advise us--and that is the focus of its training--on the kind of thinking that would help restore our minds to their natural state of true innocence, because from that state, you would know what the most loving course of action is for both you and your husband. You would not have to agonize over it. You would either stay or leave, but whatever you choose, you would do it without conflict, guilt, anger, or fear. It is not easy to reach that state, as you have discovered in the short amount of time you have been working with the Course--normally, it is a process that occurs over many years. But holy instants in which you are free of ego investments are within reach at any stage of the process: \"The necessary condition for the holy instant does not require that you have no thoughts that are not pure. But it does require that you have none that you would keep\" (T- 15.IV.9:1-2). That instant without fear or guilt aligns your thinking with the compassionate truth that is always present in your right mind. It is vital that you be gentle with yourself when you practice forgiveness imperfectly as well as when you refuse to forgive. There are many layers of fear in our minds that account for our resistance and all the difficulties we have with forgiveness. Jesus is our model to follow in this: he never judges us, for he sees our ego choices only as mistakes in need of correction, not sins demanding punishment. He asks that we have this same attitude when we are tempted to judge ourselves for our unwillingness and our imperfect practice. There is no merit in fighting against yourself just in order to be spiritual or a \"good\" Course in Miracles student (T-30.I.1:7). It is important, too, to understand that forgiveness is never about the other person; it is solely about recognizing all anger as a projection of our own guilt, and that our concealed ongoing choice to believe in our sinfulness is the real and only source of our unhappiness and lack of peace, not what other people do or do not do to us. That is why the overriding emphasis in the Course is on looking within at the contents of our minds and restoring to our awareness the power we have to choose to follow either the ego's teachings or Jesus'. That is the function of the miracle: \"The miracle establishes you dream a dream, and that its content is not true\" (T- 28.II.7:1). Questions #501 and #675 also address the type of situation you find yourself in. The discussion elaborates on some points made here, with particular emphasis on the ego pitfalls that students are apt to miss in their attempts to deal with the pain and anger of abusive relationships."

    "text_input": "Q #1362: What might be stopping someone from making the transition from student to practitioner in any health field? For at least five years I have undertaken much study in bodywork modalities, yet I have not felt confident enough to make the transition from student to practitioner. Sometimes it's hard to know if your reluctance to start practicing is because you truly are not ready and don't have the appropriate skill base to begin, or whether it is because of something more related to your self-concept, responsibility, power, etc. I am wondering if this whole difficulty in making the transition from student to practitioner could in some way be related to the ontological split as described by A Course in Miracles. Do you have any ideas as to what the \"bigger picture\" might be relating to all of this? A: Many times this type of block is related to a guilt-laden self-concept. The guilt, of course, is ultimately rooted in the ego's response to the separation from God: it was a terrible sin deserving of severe and eternal punishment, if not death, by an avenging God. This deep layer of guilt in our minds would unconsciously motivate our life in the world in different ways. We might try to hide our \"sin,\" for example, by never being successful in the world. That way, we reason, God would go easy on us if He were to catch up with us. We might also feel terribly unworthy of success. Since we accuse ourselves of having destroyed God's Kingdom and our true Identity to get our personal existence--we stole it--we might never allow ourselves to be successful or in a position of power or authority over other people for fear of destroying them as well. At an unconscious level we would know that we are living a lie here, and fear being exposed as such, and therefore one solution to that dilemma would be to stay in the background, as we would judge that. All of this has been described as a \"maladaptive solution to a non-existent problem.\" The problem, in other words, is not the inability to make a transition in the world. The problem is that we believe we are here at God's expense and that we are going to have to pay dearly for that terrible act, so we had better do something about it. We listened to the ego's tale of sin, guilt, and fear and ultimately wound up believing we really exist as individuals and that our problems all have to do with the world, including our own bodies, physical and psychological. Not true! says Jesus in the Course. It is impossible to separate from infinity and therefore we are not justified in accusing ourselves of sin. This is the Atonement principle. Thus, as students of A Course in Miracles we learn to see our lives and relationships in the world as a classroom in which we are going to learn the lessons that will undo the erroneous beliefs that are the source of whatever seems to be bothering us. It is the choice we are making in our minds to believe the ego's tale that is the problem. Therefore, the purpose we now give to our lives is to remember to laugh at all of the expressions of the \"tiny, mad idea\" that we could be separate from our Source (T-27.VIII.6:2). We can do this in any role, profession, or career, on any level. The chosen content in our minds would direct all of our functioning.",

Then the love and truth in our mind will flow through and be expressed in the form most helpful at the time. This, in fact, is the essence of a message Jesus gave to Helen: \"You cannot ask, 'What shall I say to him?' and hear God's answer. Rather ask instead, 'Help me to see this brother through the eyes of truth and not of judgment,' and the help of God and all His angels will respond\" (Absence from Felicity, second edition, p. 381; first edition, p. 396). The \"help of God and all His angels\" is Jesus' poetic way of referring to the Holy Spirit's Presence in our minds.

This is all part of the ego's strategy to keep out attention away from our minds, where we could recognize that we are always choosing between the ego's thought system and the correction of that, the Holy Spirit's thought system.

That is the state of mind known in A Course in Miracles as the real world, a totally unified state of mind. There is no longer a split between two thought systems and no longer a decision maker who chooses between them. All the interferences to the truth of Who we are have gone."

A: First, it is wonderful that you have discovered that what motivates the disciplining of your daughter are your judgments against yourself that you have projected onto her, and therefore that the focus ought to be on forgiving yourself. It is not a complicated process! Second, there is nothing wrong in sharing these experiences and insights with others. You can describe how you deal with your daughter without ever mentioning A Course in Miracles, although it would be fine to refer to it if the conversation leads there. A problem would arise only if you separate yourself from your friends in your mind by judging them--feeling more spiritually advanced, for example. It is always the content that matters. The same form --parents discussing child-rearing experiences--can have the content of either the wrong mind or the right mind. Focusing on the purpose of the conversation would help: Are you there to learn that differences don't matter and that you all share the same wrong mind, right mind, and decision-making capacity, or are you there to show that you are special in some way? Clarifying that level of your thinking is the best way to keep the conversation on a helpful level, to you and the other parents. It is perfectly normal for parents to talk about their experiences. Just try to do so for the right reason: as a means of healing your own mind of polluting thoughts of judgment and specialness. Your willingness to choose Jesus rather than the ego as your teacher will bring this shift about."

Ranjit responded that the Course's position was correct. I include this to show that this lineage's teaching, at the highest level, seems to correspond (in content at least) with the pure non- dualistic position of the Course.",
    "output": "Ramana and Nisargadatta were both asked frequently about the question of pain. Their responses were similar-- that there was great pain but no one experiencing it. However if, as the Course states, all pain is in the mind, and is an extension of guilt, then it would seem that these realized beings were experiencing guilt at some level. A further simple question is: who is experiencing guilt when there is no sense of ego identity as a separate entity? If there is indeed no doership (free will/volition) where would the Course locate the sense of separation in these teachers? Ramana would say there is \"no creation or destruction\" and that \"nothing is born and nothing dies.\" According to Advaita, this \"experience of understanding\" takes place when the ego ceases effortlessly and the realization dawns that the ego and the thought of separation literally never occurred. Please comment. A: One of the conclusions we reached in #933 when we discussed the Advaita Vedanta teachings was that \"despite using different words which seem to point to different practices, the Course and Advaita are really saying the same thing.\" Our discussion emphasized the importance of recognizing the two levels on which the Course is written, a distinction that is relevant to these questions about pain. Speaking on the level of absolute truth (Level One), the Course says that pain is not real (W- pI.190.3:3-4). A healed mind--i.e., a mind outside the dream but still aware of other minds dreaming of existence in a world apart from God--would perceive the pain experienced by the figures in the dream, while at the same time knowing that the pain is real only in the dreams of minds that are in the process of awakening or else still choosing not to awaken. The healed mind would not feel that pain. This is the second level of discussion in the Course. On the other hand, a healed mind could appear in form as a help to those seeking to awaken, but this would simply be a symbol or a representation in form of the memory of wholeness and invulnerability that we all have in our right minds. Perhaps this is what Ramana Maharshi and Nisargadatta were saying. This form could appear with some of the limitations, disabilities, and illnesses common to humans, but the experience of pain and infirmity would be radically different because there would be no identification with the pain and infirmity. The healed mind knows with certainty that the body is not its identity and so the pain would have no significance to that mind. In this sense, there is pain, but it doesn't mean anything. Thus, in this case, the pain does not stem from guilt but from the love that appears in a form that we can recognize and accept. This is in contrast to the unhealed mind that is still very much identified with the body and an individual self. For this self, therefore, pain has tremendous significance: there is still an I that is in pain and very much threatened by it."

    "text_input": "Q #1371: I'm struggling with a choice on what career to choose. I understand that A Course in Miracles teaches that purpose, not form, matters and that any circumstance is an opportunity to practice forgiveness and therefore be purified and ready for enlightenment. But my dilemma is that I am eager for the path of spiritual development, feel a passion for learning about spirituality, traveling the world, seeing the world--and very ultimately being a part of the solution for healing the world--yet I also have passions for acting (and painting) and happen to be good at both. My acting classes are just starting again and I'm with a group where now it is make or break--I go for it wholeheartedly or not, which means a daily dedication to that form of development. My fear is that I could be devoting myself to a greater cause--to the cause of healing. Those hours could be spent with the sick, for example. Acting, of all the arts it seems to me, is such an ego thing and I don't know if I could do it and be true to my conscience, when so many people are dying (I work for a charity that helps kids in poorer countries) and the world is so sick and in so much pain on so many different levels. A: Relax! There is a statement in the Course that is repeated over and over again, with some variation, throughout all three books, that every Course in Miracles student should take to heart: \"The sole responsibility of the miracle worker is to accept the Atonement for himself\" (T- 2.V.5:1). And this simply means that we need only be concerned, moment to moment, with the choice we are making within our minds for either the ego or the Holy Spirit. In the end, and on every step along the way, nothing else matters. Concern for the world and all the pain and suffering seems to be such a noble dedication, yet the Course's radical position is that such a focus is in reality just another way of reinforcing the ego, and therefore is an attack (e.g., M-7.4:4-7). It may seem unkind, even heartless, to diminish the significance of the world and all its problems, yet the reason follows very directly from the Course's basic metaphysical premises. The world, as real as it may seem, is nothing more than the symbolic shadow of the mind's guilt over choosing the ego (T-18.IX.4), desiring separation rather than oneness. To focus our attention on the world is to fall into the ego's trap of mindlessness, insisting that we know what the problem is and how it can be resolved. The world is not the problem and the Course means this quite literally! To focus on the world is to assure that the real problem of choosing separation in the mind and taking it seriously is never recognized nor addressed (W-pI.79).",
    "output": "There is no hierarchy in the world of illusion (T-26.VII.6). It is not what we do, but with whom we do it that Jesus is asking us to realize is all that matters. One can commit oneself to alleviating the world's suffering and simply reinforce the underlying belief in victimhood, which the ego has invented as a means for maintaining guilt but seeing it outside oneself. Furthermore, the healer role can be used for purposes of self-aggrandizement, or to cover over one's own feelings of guilt and unworthiness, never questioning whether those underlying feelings have any reality. In contrast, one can devote oneself to the stage and acting and serve the Holy Spirit's purpose by helping oneself and others recognize that at some level, we are all the same, and ultimately, that the whole world is an act, and none of it is to be taken seriously. And of course, just the opposite is possible, since the form itself is irrelevant. One can be involved in helping relieve and heal the pain and the suffering of others in the world in very specific, concrete ways, yet hold the awareness that all pain and suffering are truly only in the mind, which is all that is need of healing. And one can, as you suggest, use an acting career as a vehicle for self-aggrandizement, or perhaps to even greater detriment, as a means for propagandizing for the ego and all its values, including the reality of attack, betrayal and victimhood. To reiterate, the form of our involvement in the world does not matter. It is the purpose we choose for it that counts. If we recognize that our only responsibility is to accept the Atonement for ourselves, we will also increasingly recognize that whatever we do will provide just the opportunity we need to learn our lessons of forgiveness and withdraw the projections of guilt that we have placed upon the world. To believe there is anything else meaningful we can do is to insist that we are right and to refuse the only real help that is available to us to alleviate all pain and suffering at its source."

I have long been okay with this, since I understand that any magic is magic, whether it is a pharmaceutical drug or an herb capsule. But, I realized recently that I perceive homeopaths to consider themselves to be more \"enlightened\" than allopaths. And this bothers me. I realize this is about me, not about them, because I am the one who cares what they think. How can I resolve this?",
    "output": "First, it is important to have recognized that \"any magic is magic.\" This restates the central principle in A Course in Miracles that there is no hierarchy among illusions. Both forms of medicine are magic, to the extent that they are used to correct conditions in the body, whether psychological and physical. Being bothered by other people's claims to superiority usually reflects a projection of guilt or self-loathing over a similar attitude within yourself. Jesus instructs us about this in Lesson 134: \"When you feel that you are tempted to accuse someone of sin in any form, do not allow your mind to dwell on what you think he did, for that is self-deception. Ask instead, 'Would I accuse myself of doing this?'\" (W-pI.134.9). This has to do with content, not form. In other words, you could ask yourself, \"What is it about what they are doing that bugs me?\" Try to get at the meaning of their feeling superior--what that triggers in you. Whatever it is, you would be accusing yourself of doing it, although in a different form more than likely. If nothing surfaces for you, that's okay. Just know that you are bothered by their attitude only because of something within you that you hate or are ashamed of and want to keep hidden, thus unforgivable. It is important that you focus on the judgment you are making and realize that that is the problem, not the other people's behavior. You would not be bothered by that if you had not already chosen against love in your mind and then judged yourself for it. Try to accept that whatever ego choice you are accusing yourself of making, it is never more than a mistake--and mistakes are in need of correction, not condemnation. Thus, if you can't identify the specific \"sin\" in you that is being projected and hated in these other people, you can still change your mind about your interpretation of it. You can still ask Jesus to help you see with him that sin and guilt are nothing more than toys that children play with and one day are put away forever (T- 29.IX.5). You will then look through his eyes and see not cause for judgment, but for compassion as you recognize your interests as being shared by everyone else. Finally, you can feel grateful for this opportunity that has come up to deal with guilt that would have remained concealed had you not been willing to take responsibility for your perceptions."

How do you account for this? A: In #783, we discuss some of the important differences between Joel Goldsmith's teachings and those of A Course in Miracles. It is true that physical symptoms disappear in some people as they practice the Course. The connection would be the letting go of guilt, as the Course teaches that sickness has its roots in the guilt that we are choosing to hold on to in our minds. But it can also be a right-minded choice--one possible reason for choosing it being to demonstrate that the body cannot affect our inner state of peace.",

Yet half the lesson will not teach the whole. The miracle is useless if you learn but that the body can be healed, for this is not the lesson it was sent to teach. The lesson is the mind was sick that thought the body could be sick; projecting out its guilt caused nothing, and had no effects\" (T-28.II.11:4-7). The real healing, thus, is the reversal of effect and cause--the mind is sick, not the body, despite the appearance of bodily symptoms. The body is the effect; the mind is the cause. That is the function of the miracle--to shift our perception from the body to the mind, where we would then recognize that our mind's decision is the sole cause of everything we experience. We are always deciding to have either the ego as our teacher or Jesus (T-14.III.4). Getting us back to that state of mind is the real healing and the only function of the miracle."

Please tell me how to deal with myself until I can allow the Holy Spirit to show me differently.",
    "output": "For any meaningful and lasting shift in our perception to occur, we will have to come to the recognition that we are all trying to deceive each other all the time, even when we think we are not being deceitful in the world's terms. For the world's terms are deceitful and deceiving. As A Course in Miracles teaches, the whole world, as well as the self we believe we are, is predicated on a lie--the original ego deceit that we could separate from God. This sense of deceit is at the very core of our individual existence. And we don't want to look at that lie, the ego tells us, because we will have to come face-to-face with our sinfulness and guilt for having lied, deserving of God's punishment. But the truth is, not that the lie is a sin, but that it is exactly that--a lie--which means that it is not true, that the separation has never happened. And that's what the ego, concerned only with self survival, does not want us to realize. And while we choose to listen to the ego, our reality will seem to be the world and bodies, along with an uneasy sense of deceit and dishonesty in our minds that we do not want to acknowledge. But since the world and our body depend on the lie, we will remain attracted to the deceit so long as we remain invested in our self and the world. We need the deceit to continue to maintain our separate identity, but we do not want to accept responsibility for the lie. And so we want to see the deceit outside in anyone but ourselves. We are all secretly, and sometimes not so secretly, looking to catch someone else in a lie, for our ego is invested in proving that others are the deceitful ones so that we may assert our innocence. And since all of us, when we are identified with the ego, are doing the same thing, our suspicions of our brothers can seem quite well-founded. Now to disentangle ourselves from this web of deception and deceit can seem almost impossible. And on our own, it is impossible, for all we can do is swap the guilt of the lie back and forth, either seeing it in others or embracing the guilt as our own. We need help from a source that lies outside the lie, that can help us look at it and recognize that although it is false, it is not evil, and in reality it has had no effects, so there truly is no guilt. The only real relief from the ugly projections of the ego will come from looking at them honestly and recognizing first of all their purpose and then the flimsiness, and ultimately the unreality, of their source. But this will be a process that is not likely to happen all at once for most of us. First steps will be taken as we come to realize that not just some of us but all of us are children of the lie. And that, just as we may try to help a young child understand, Jesus wants to reassure us that a lie does not make us bad, but it still can be hurtful to ourselves and others. For so long as we continue to cling to the lie, we are clinging to our pain. But when we are willing to release the lie and see ourselves differently, we will see all our brothers and sisters differently as well. For further examination of our attraction to deceit, you may find the CD \"The Othello Syndrome: Innocence Lost ... Innocence Regained\" helpful."

    "text_input": "Q #1375: We are going all the way. Is this why we Course students do so many crazy shenanigans? Because somewhere in our minds, we know this is it? I've heard Ken say that the fear level in Course students is high. Is that why?",
    "output": "Yes, ultimately our fear is of returning home to God because that means letting go of everything we made to replace our true Identity as Christ, eternally one with God. The sincere and honest practice of A Course in Miracles is a process that gradually exposes the series of lies on which our lives have been based, which means we begin to sense (with varying degrees of discomfort) that we are not who we think we are and our lives and all of our relationships are not what we think they are. Then we realize that no one did this to us--we chose to deceive ourselves to get the separate and special identity that we wanted but could not have as part of God's perfect Oneness. In our determination to get and maintain this identity we became indifferent to the fact that it would always be at someone else's expense, starting with God Himself. A truly horrifying recognition. The fear that we would some day get caught and then punished for this is hidden in our minds. And therefore when the once tightly sealed lid that kept this fear concealed begins to loosen, the fear starts to rise to the surface. It was always there, and identifying with individualized bodily existence was supposed to protect us from it, but when we choose to embark on the journey with Jesus, he gently leads us within to uncover the deception that has resulted in the colossal mess we call our world and our lives. Fear is inevitable as we go within, because, once again, the purpose of choosing the body and the world as our home was to prevent us from ever getting in touch with the terror we believed defined our home in the mind. The value of our relationship with Jesus is that he is not part of our insanity--he symbolizes for us the sane part of our mind that we had split off--and therefore he can help us retrace our misguided steps back to the point where we made the one mistake of believing we pulled off the impossible: separating from eternal Oneness. Our fear dissipates as we simply look at it with his vision becoming ours, which reveals its unreality. We sacrifice nothing; we merely let go of what never was. Students' struggles with fear and their defenses against it are discussed in a series of Questions-- see, for example, #384, #533, #943, #963, and #986."

    "output": "#796 discusses the nature of the ego, emphasizing that it is not an entity but simply the name given to the thought of separation taken seriously. In this context, the answer to your question is No, because the ego is not a thing that has capabilities. There is a part of our mind, however, that is always choosing whether to continue in a state of separation or to accept the Atonement and return to its natural state of Oneness with God. And therefore A Course in Miracles can be described as a mind-training program aimed at helping us recognize that we, as minds, are always making a choice between these two alternatives, and that there are steps we can take that will help us make the sane choice more and more consistently. See, for example, T-1.VII.4:1; W- in.1,4; W-pI.8.3; C-1.7. This training, importantly, really consists of undoing the training program we followed once we took the tiny, mad idea of separation seriously and then moved full-speed ahead in our determination never to allow anything to interfere with our pursuit of individuality and specialness. Thus, Jesus speaks of the learning that teachers of God bring to this world as \"unlearning\" (M-4.X.3:7). Finally, there are rare times in the Course where Jesus uses the term ego, when it is clear from the context that he is referring to the decision-making aspect of the mind--for example, T- 4.I.2:13."

    "output": "Only the mind of God's Son has lessons to learn--humans, dogs, elephants, etc., neither learn lessons nor accept miracles. That is one of the important points made in #340, which discusses animals as part of the Sonship. It is tough for us to grasp, but a major objective of the mind- training program of A Course in Miracles is to teach us to perceive correctly--to perceive everything having form as a projection of the mind, realizing that the purpose of our relating to form as reality is to keep us from returning to our minds and becoming aware of the choices we make as minds that are behind all of our experiences. So the answer to your question is Yes, if you perceive animals as part of the Sonship, part of the same mind of which you are a part and that believes it is separate from God."

    "text_input": "Q #1378: Is it possible to hate the body and all the ego ugliness that it stands for while still loving the mind/spirit for all its healed wholeness? Or is this just more evidence of a very split mind?",
    "output": "To hate the body is to confuse effect (the body) with cause (the mind), and thus to remain mindless, which is the surest way of maintaining a split mind. Jesus makes it clear that we only think we hate the body: \"You have displaced your guilt to your body from your mind. Yet a body cannot be guilty, for it can do nothing of itself. You who think you hate your body deceive yourself. You hate your mind, for guilt has entered into it, and it would remain separate from your brother's, which it cannot do\" (T-18.VI.2:5-8). Jesus goes on to describe the insanity of hating the body, since it can only ever serve whatever purpose our mind assigns to it: \"It is insane to use the body as the scapegoat for guilt, directing its attack and blaming it for what you wished it to do ... Fantasies have made your body your 'enemy'; weak, vulnerable and treacherous, worthy of the hate that you invest in it. How has this served you? You have identified with this thing you hate, the instrument of vengeance and the perceived source of your guilt. You have done this to a thing that has no meaning, proclaiming it to be the dwelling place of God's Son, and turning it against him\" (T-18.VI.6:1,5-8; italics added). And later he explains in great detail, \"You send it [the body] forth to seek for separation and be separate. And then you hate it, not for what it is, but for the uses you have made of it. You shrink from what it sees and what it hears, and hate its frailty and littleness. And you despise its acts, but not your own. It sees and acts for you. It hears your voice. And it is frail and little by your wish. It seems to punish you, and thus deserve your hatred for the limitations that it brings to you. Yet you have made of it a symbol for the limitations that you want your mind to have and see and keep. The body represents the gap between the little bit of mind you call your own and all the rest of what is really yours. You hate it, yet you think it is your self, and that, without it, would your self be lost\" (T-28.VI.3:2-10; 4:1- 2). The body, while made to convince us that we are separate, can be seen as simply neutral (W- pII.294). \"Its neutrality protects it [the body] while it has a use. And afterwards, without a purpose, it is laid aside. It is not sick nor old nor hurt. It is but functionless, unneeded and cast off ... What is not created cannot be sinful nor sinless; neither good nor bad\" (W-pII.294.1:6-9; 2:2). But for the body to be seen as neutral, we must let go of our own ego purpose for it. In the end, it makes no difference whether we hate or love the body, for either feeling simply keeps the ego illusion alive and real in our mind. \"Some hate the body, and try to hurt and humiliate it. Others love the body, and try to glorify and exalt it. But while the body stands at the center of your concept of yourself, you are attacking God's plan for salvation, and holding your grievances against Him and His creation, that you may not hear the Voice of truth and welcome It as Friend\" (W-pI.72.7:2-4). For either to hate or to love the body is to react to nothing and insist that it is something, thereby denying God's perfect Oneness: \"The body that is asked to be a god will be attacked, because its nothingness has not been recognized. And so it seems to be a thing with power in itself. As something, it can be perceived and thought to feel and act, and hold you in its grasp as prisoner to itself. And it can fail to be what you demanded that it be. And you will hate it for its littleness, unmindful that the failure does not lie in that it is not more than it should be, but only in your failure to perceive that it is nothing. Yet its nothingness is your salvation, from which you would flee. \"As 'something' is the body asked to be God's enemy, replacing what He is with littleness and limit and despair. It is His loss you celebrate when you behold the body as a thing you love, or look upon it as a thing you hate. For if He be the sum of everything, then what is not in Him does not exist, and His completion is its nothingness.\" (T-29.II.9,10:1-3) We are not the ones who give the body its new purpose. We merely accept that it can serve a purpose different from the one we have given it, by releasing it from the ego's judgments through which we have bound it. Jesus assures us: \"Be not disturbed at all to think how He can change the role of means and end so easily in what God loves, and would have free forever. But be you rather grateful that you can be the means to serve His end. This is the only service that leads to freedom. To serve this end the body must be perceived as sinless, because the goal is sinlessness. The lack of contradiction makes the soft transition from means to end as easy as is the shift from hate to gratitude before forgiving eyes. You will be sanctified by your brother, using your body only to serve the sinless. And it will be impossible for you to hate what serves whom you would heal\" (T-22.VI.3). So long as we hate the body and what the ego has made it to represent, we can not truly love mind/spirit for its healed wholeness. For the healed mind can only look on thoughts of sin and their seeming effects, including the body, with gentle laughter at the silliness of it all. With this shift, \"the body can become a sign of life, a promise of redemption, and a breath of immortality to those grown sick of breathing in the fetid scent of death. Let it have healing as its purpose. Then will it send forth the message it received, and by its health and loveliness proclaim the truth and value that it represents. Let it receive the power to represent an endless life, forever unattacked ... The simple way to let this be achieved is merely this; to let the body have no purpose from the past, when you were sure you knew its purpose was to foster guilt. For this insists your crippled picture is a lasting sign of what it represents. This leaves no space in which a different view, another purpose, can be given it. You do not know its purpose. You but gave illusions of a purpose to a thing you made to hide your function from yourself. This thing without a purpose cannot hide the function that the Holy Spirit gave. Let, then, its purpose and your function both be reconciled at last and seen as one\" (T-27.I.10:3-6; 11)."

    "text_input": "Q #1379: The other day I finally understood a crucial concept: that my behavior is directed by my perceptions and not by the events in the world around me. Though this is said hundreds of times in many ways in A Course in Miracles, it has taken nine years for it to click for me. Now I feel stuck because I don't know what to do! If my perceptions drive my behavior, how do I change my perceptions? And do I even need/want to? Could this be the meaning of \"I need do nothing\"? I feel thrilled that I understand this crucial concept, and yet depressed because I don't know what to make of it or how to apply this learning to my daily life! A: Take heart! This is exactly why Jesus gave us the workbook. The Introduction nicely summarizes its purpose: \"The workbook is divided into two main sections, the first dealing with the undoing of the way you see now, and the second with the acquisition of true perception\" (W- in.3:1). Thus, by practicing the lessons in Part I of the workbook and then generalizing them, we undo our commitment to the ego's way of perceiving, which is a way of saying that we stop interfering with the natural flow of love in our minds. The training gradually helps us experience ourselves as decision-making minds that are always choosing to perceive either the ego's thought system or the Holy Spirit's. We learn to recognize all the ways in which we are perceiving separation, for example, and then to acknowledge that we are choosing to perceive that way, because we want to perceive that way. That is the point we want to reach experientially, because then we are in a position to ask ourselves whether we want to continue perceiving that way or to choose the other available option in our minds, which is the Holy Spirit's perception that would have us see each other as all sharing the same interests. If we don't know we have a mind and the power to choose what we will experience (content, not form), then we will continue to relate to ourselves and others primarily as victims of happenings not under our control. Jesus' training, thus, is aimed at helping us shift from a state of mindlessness to mindfulness. So, basically, we do not have to change our perceptions; we just have to look at what we are choosing, ask ourselves if we want to continue that way, and, if not, say \"no\" to the ego. Right-minded perception will automatically take its place--it was always there; we were just rejecting it and substituting our own (the ego's) perception. Judging yourself because it took so long for this to click is silly--and clearly of the ego. You are assuming that nine years is a long time, but according to whose standard of progress? You are not aware of the entirety of your Atonement path (which is true of all of us), so how would you know what it means? Be cautious about using criteria rooted in the world of time and space to assess your spiritual process. You are learning that you are not defined by the world and the body, and that they were made up to block your perception of the truth, so why would you rely on them to tell you about something totally beyond them? Be grateful, instead, that your fear lessened enough to part this veil. Move on now with greater trust in the process itself. As Jesus instructs us, \"All that is asked of you is to make room for truth. You are not asked to make or do what lies beyond your understanding. All you are asked to do is let it in; only to stop your interference with what will happen of itself; simply to recognize again the presence of what you thought you gave away\" (T-21.II.7:6-8).",

Now when I am confronted in a particular situation I read one or several of them. The instant I read I feel better, I feel that I am in my right mind and I accept as best I can that the guilt is in my mind and that I made the choice for separation. But as soon as I finish reading, I forget the whole thing entirely, I hardly remember what I read an instant ago and I have to read it over again. I do not understand why I have such a short memory in those occasions. It is as if the ego does not want me to use my right mind and brings me back to my wrong mind as soon as I finish reading. Is it that I am trying too hard and that I am falling into the ego's trap? A: Fear of oneness and peace does funny things to all of us. And understanding something from A Course in Miracles very clearly and experiencing the release it offers in one moment and then feeling totally clueless about it all in the next is just one of those funny things, and a pretty common one at that. The main thing is, don't judge yourself for it and don't try to fight it. Just smile at yourself and rest assured that the understanding is never lost, only temporarily blocked from your awareness by your own decision, motivated by a desire for \"self\"-preservation. As the experience has become familiar enough that you recognize the pattern and can ask about it, you may just want to watch yourself the next time you turn to the printed pages for the support, and see if you can notice, perhaps ever so imperceptibly at first, that almost unconscious decision to forget. But don't make a big deal about it. Just see if you can very quietly sneak up on your ego as it tries to sneak up on you.

    "text_input": "Q #1381: My question is about the relationship between cause and effect, specifically, the principle that if the effect can be shown, through forgiveness, to have no effect on anyone, the cause then disappears, as does the effect. The example often given is that of Jesus rising from the dead to prove death is not real. However, isn't this using forgiveness at the level of the body instead of the level of the mind? If one wishes to get rid of an effect, one should, through forgiveness, forgive the cause at the level of the mind, and then both the cause and effect disappear. Also, is it necessary when forgiving the cause of an effect to know the exact cause or thought that produced the effect? This has psychiatric ramifications--one may need professional help to identify that particular cause. A: Understanding the cause-effect relationship is essential for one's work with A Course in Miracle, both in terms of grasping its theory and practicing its teachings of forgiveness. We must be brief in our discussion here, but we refer you below to some of our publications for comprehensive presentations of this theme. Our answer is based largely on A Talk Given on A Course in Miracles,\" Seventh Edition, Chapter 5, \"Jesus: The Purpose of His Life.\"",
    "output": "What Jesus ultimately demonstrated was that sin is not real, which in turn means that separation is not real. \"Now, if the greatest effect of sin in this world is death, demonstrating that death is an illusion simultaneously demonstrates that there is no sin. This also says that the separation never occurred\" (p. 120). This is one of the most important messages in A Course in Miracles, and it corrects what the Churches have traditionally taught about his life and message. \"So Jesus took on the most compelling witness to the reality of this world and he showed that it had no hold over him. That was the whole meaning of his life, his mission, and his function. To overcome death is to show that death is not real, that its seeming cause [sin] also is not real, and that we therefore never really separated ourselves from our Father\" (pp. 121-22). That was the objective of Jesus' teaching--to demonstrate to us that we never truly separated from God. He chose a way that would be extremely meaningful to us, who have a most difficult time believing we are not bodies! His teaching is deliberately--and lovingly--designed to meet us where we are. He focuses first on the body so that he can lead us beyond it. Applied to the practice of forgiveness in our daily lives, these principles mean that we should strive to demonstrate to others that their seeming sin (attack) against us has had no effect, that whatever they did had no effect on our inner peace. If their sin had no effect, it is causeless; and if it is causeless, it does not exist. Thus, we forgive others for what they did not do to us, the Course's unique approach to forgiveness. In the process, we also learn that we, too, are forgiven--our seeming sin of separating from God had no effect, and therefore we do not need defenses to protect ourselves from the consequences of the sin we accuse ourselves of committing--we were just mistaken in believing we sinned. Jesus is our prime model and teacher in this. The attacks of others appeared to be causing him to suffer, but by not attacking back and continuing to love and forgive the \"attackers\" instead, he demonstrated that their sin against him had no effect, which meant they had not sinned--they were simply mistaken and were calling out for help. (See \"The Message of the Crucifixion\" in Chapter 6 of the text.) That is how Jesus forgives us, too. And he asks that we be like him--to approach all of our seeming grievances and experiences of being unfairly treated the same way. Not easy, for sure! But that is why he remains within us--to help us learn and practice this. Sometimes the help of a professional is needed to uncover dynamics that are responsible for the way we experience our lives and interactions. Traumatic experiences can result in psychological blocks that inhibit or even halt further growth, and therapy can be useful in identifying and getting past these blocks. Ultimately, however, it is always the guilt in our minds and the fear of letting it go that are the core of our problems, whether physical or psychological. And so, in that sense, it is not always necessary to single out specific causes on other levels to make spiritual progress. It is enough to have the willingness to forgive--to want to choose the right teacher, and to want to look at one's ego non-judgmentally. (See the Psychotherapy supplement: P-2.VI.5.) Again, though, it is never wrong or spiritually retarding to seek professional assistance. Finally, the effects you want to \"get rid of\" are all the perceptions and experiences of separation, the results of the ongoing choice to remain apart from God as special individuals. It is normal to want to get rid of \"effects\" such as pain, physical/emotional inadequacies, financial problems, and other bodily conditions and circumstances--and one should do whatever one can on that level--but that should not be the focus of one's work with this course, as you seem to point out. Our focus should be turned within--toward the choice we are making in our minds to interpret what goes on in our body and the world the way we do. When we finally shift from the ego's interpretation to the Holy Spirit's, the conditions and circumstances of our lives will no longer be an issue, even though there may have been no external changes. We will approach everything from that \"quiet center\" (T-18.VII.8:3), assured once and for all that nothing can disrupt the peace within that is our inheritance as God's one Son. For further study of the cause-effect theme, see Kenneth's audio \"Cause and Effect\" and the section \"Cause and Effect\" in Chapter 2 of his Forgiveness and Jesus."

    "text_input": "Q #1382: How do we really know we forgive others or a situation, and how do we actually do it? Do we continue to mouth 'I forgive you' over and over silently or quite literally until we might begin to mean it? For example, I am trying to forgive my company and the rather insufferable working and living conditions I must endure. Life in a presumed body is difficult enough without compounding the difficulties by accepting life conditions that are below basic minimal standards of the developed world. Sometimes I ask the Holy Spirit for guidance, but is this too gross a question to ask, being preoccupied with material conditions and survival and so forth? And how do I know for sure it is the Holy Spirit that answers and not my predilections? A: There is nothing in A Course in Miracles or its teachings on forgiveness that advocate staying in situations that make you miserable or threaten your health and well-being. That would not be the Course's gentle approach to spiritual advancement. As long as we still believe we are bodies, it is quite normal to want to live and work in conditions that meet one's preferred standard of living, and it is not wrong or unspiritual to be thinking about that. Denying our bodily and psychological needs is something Jesus strongly cautions us against (T-2.IV.3:8-11). The Course's path is a gentle one, meeting us where we are right now.",
    "output": "Forgiveness is not achieved through forcing yourself to believe something you really do not believe or to do something you really do not want to do. We all have split minds, which means part of us truly wants to learn this course and another part is resisting it tooth and nail. But, again, this is a gentle path, and therefore it places great value on our \"little willingness\" to do what it asks of us. So rather than mouth words hoping one day they will be more than words, it would be more helpful to acknowledge how much you do not want to forgive your company, and how much you want to hold them responsible for your misery, feeling perfectly justified in doing so. That is more honest. Then you can simply look at that ego dynamic and not judge yourself for it, knowing, too, that Jesus is not judging you for it either. Love never judges. At some point, you will realize that your judgments against your company are keeping you from being peaceful, and that it's not worth it to continue that way. You will then realize \"there must be another way.\" This does not mean, to repeat, that you have to stay in that situation until you have forgiven. The same lesson will reappear in different circumstances, you can be sure; so you needn't fear that you are losing your one and only opportunity to get past your ego."

    "text_input": "Q #1383: I am perplexed as to the warnings presented by the special relationship. I have renewed a sacred friendship with a woman whom I knew in college almost thirty years ago. I love her dearly and she loves me, and although we almost never actually see each other, we have taken on the task of reintroducing each other to God and ourselves. Why is this a bad thing? Why does the text render this as \"the renunciation of the Love of God ... \" (T-16.V.4:2)? Yes, we are sexual. Why should I reject that gift? A: The purpose you give the relationship is what will determine whether or not it is a renunciation of God's Love. God's Love is our very Identity, our only real relationship, all we ever truly need (T-15.VIII); and therefore if our peace and happiness depend on having another person's affection, comfort, approval, gifts, attention, or anything else-- physical/emotional/psychological--then it has become a substitute for God's Love, which in our ego minds we believe we rejected because it did not offer us the specialness we demanded. That is what the rest of the passage you cited explains: \"[the special relationship is] the attempt to secure for the self the specialness that He denied.\" Jesus is not asking us to sacrifice what we think we want; he is helping us realize that we have already made an extremely painful sacrifice and are trying to deal with it in a maladaptive way: \"You but seek in them [special relationships] what you have thrown away. And through them you will never learn the value of what you have cast aide, but still desire with all your heart\" (T- 15.VIII.2:1-3). The emptiness and loneliness we feel deep within because of our rejection of God and our oneness with Him impel us to seek for fulfillment outside--in another person, substance, object, etc.; and Jesus is helping us learn that the special relationship will never succeed in giving us true and lasting happiness and peace because we are not addressing the real cause of our sense of lack and need. That is why we need his help and guidance with our relationships. It is probably safe to say that every relationship starts out as a special relationship and that many never get beyond the level of mutual fulfillment of needs because we are not aware of the true origin of our desires and needs. Yet, we are not asked to give up our special relationships, for if we so choose, they can serve to heal our minds of all thoughts of separation, and then, rather than being replacements for the Love of God, they can bring us closer to God by becoming reflections of His Love. This is the process of transforming a special relationship into a holy one.",
    "output": "In working through this process, it is important to distinguish between form and content. This is the primary focus of Kenneth's discussion in his book and audio album Form versus Content: Sex and Money. The content is the purpose we choose in our minds, which can either reinforce our separateness or undo it, by our choosing the Holy Spirit's purpose of seeing our interests as shared, not separate and conflicting. This is a common concern among students of A Course in Miracles, obviously. We have addressed it in other Questions which you might wish to look at. See Questions #366, #899, and #987, for example, that elaborate on some of our discussion above."

    "text_input": "Q #1384: The most common concern I hear from people who have seriously attempted to study and practice A Course in Miracles is that it provides no help for processing the emotions that arise in the context of the truths the Course brings out.",
    "output": "There is no doubt that emotions get stirred up once one begins to take the Course seriously. This is bound to happen since the Course basically reveals to us the illusory nature of everything we thought was real and important about us, our relationships, and the world--and even worse, that it was all made as \"an attack on God\" (W-pII.3.2:1). We gradually realize that we have been in massive denial and have constructed elaborate defenses to protect us from ever getting back in touch with the pain and the chaos that we think is the permanent condition of our minds (a erroneous conclusion, of course). It would be surprising if there were not a strong reaction to these realizations--along with gratitude, too, for finally understanding why our lives have never seemed to work, but that there is something we can do about it. Despite our sometimes intense fear and anxiety, Jesus assures us in different ways in the Course that we are in no real danger because we are essentially undoing what never happened, and that he is ever present in our minds to comfort and guide us as we proceed on our journey. He knows what we are going through--which is a comfort in itself--and wants to help us every step of the way if we will grow to trust him (T-4.VI.3:1; 6:1). In the workbook in one place he very personally and lovingly invites us to take his hand as we pass through the clouds we have gotten lost in to hide the light of truth from ourselves: \"Try to pass the clouds by whatever means appeals to you. If it helps you, think of me holding your hand and leading you. And I assure you this will be no idle fantasy\" (W-pI.70.9:2-4). Given all this, most students find that they still need external support of some kind, and so they work with another Course student or go to classes or group discussions where they can talk about what is happening in their process. But it must always be remembered that the process of salvation takes place exclusively between the student and Jesus (or the Holy Spirit). The way to process emotions is to regard them as projections of thoughts. You never want to deny them; you want to use them instead as a means of getting back to your mind. For example, when you choose the ego, you will feel the emotions of fear, anger, anxiety, etc.; and when you choose Jesus or the Holy Spirit, you will feel peaceful and loving. Feelings, thus, are not what they appear to be; they are reflections of the decision we have made in our minds to identify either with the ego or the Holy Spirit. Adapting a statement from the text we might say, then, that \"emotions are the outside picture of an inward condition\" (T-21.in.1:5). They can be useful, therefore, in getting us back to an experience of ourselves as decision-making minds, a primary objective of our work with the Course."

Study Methods: First, in keeping with its theory, there is no best or single method for studying A Course in Miracles. It is a curriculum undertaken by the student under the guidance of the Holy Spirit or Jesus, and as the manual for teachers specifically states, the training is \"highly individualized\" (M-9.1:5; M-29.2:6). Moreover, there can be no strict guidelines or rules that apply to every individual, as circumstances, backgrounds, and abilities, among other factors, differ greatly. With regard to reading and studying the material, Jesus does not say which should be done first--the text, the workbook, or the manual. That decision is up to each student. There is no right or wrong way of proceeding with the material. Yet, to attain a comprehensive understanding of the thought system and a solid foundation for practicing the lessons, students are encouraged to study the text at some point in their process. Jesus advises us to study it carefully, but not proceed too quickly with it, lest we plunge unnecessarily into overwhelming fear (T-I.VII.4,5; see also #1163). Also, in the Introduction to the workbook he explains that the \"theoretical foundation ... the text provides is necessary as a framework to make the exercises in this workbook meaningful\" (W-in.1:1). Thus, Jesus clearly expects his students to spend time with the text at some point in their process. A Course in Miracles: Form and Content The Course uses metaphors, and in form has many contradictory passages. That is why it cannot be read and understood exclusively on an intellectual level. Its content and loving message of forgiveness can be understood only with the willingness of the mind that opens to the truth that it reflects. The Course's teaching that the world is an illusion and the separation never happened is seemingly contradicted by the very fact that the Course itself exists in form. Clearly, then, from its inception the Course lovingly accommodates its form to be helpful to the guilt-ridden part of the mind of God's Son who believes he is irretrievably lost because of his terrible sin. According to the ego's logic, the guilt that follows the \"sin\" of separation engenders tremendous fear of punishment from an angry God. When the Course tells us God weeps and is lonely without us (T-5.VII.4:5; T-2.III.5:11), the message is that He is not an angry, vengeful God, but One Who loves us and misses us. These symbolic images are helpful to us who are able to relate to the concept of a loving father more easily than to the abstract nature of God. As Jesus tells us, \"You cannot even think of God without a body, or in some form you think you recognize\" (T- 18.VIII.1:7); and \"Yet must It [Teacher of Oneness] use the language that this mind can understand, in the condition in which it thinks it is\" (T-25.I.7:4). These lines explain the metaphors used in the Course, as well as the levels of teaching. Since we believe we are in the world, Jesus teaches us from our level of experience. Having chosen to identify with the body, we think and act and \"reason\" like bodies, so the Course comes to us in a form we can understand, and uses numerous metaphors, poetic imagery, and symbols to speak to us of the Love we have denied and forgotten. Again, the Course has to meet us where we are, and where we are is in a world that is very complex. But this is because our world has come from a very complex thought system, the thought system that dominates our minds. Therefore, if Jesus is going to be able to help us, the context of his teaching has to be this immense complexity of both our outer and inner worlds. That is what he means when he says, \"This course remains within the ego framework, where it is needed\" (C-in.3:1). Complexity is the name of the ego's game, he tells us in the text (T- 15.IV.6:2). His teachings must address this complexity in order to undo it. Thus, when we start out with the Course, it can indeed appear to be hopelessly complex, but, again, that is because it is meeting us where we are. Its purpose, though, is to lead us out of that complexity to the \"simplicity of salvation\" (T-31.I), when we will all finally realize that \"what is false is false, and what is true has never changed\" (W-pII.10.1:1). That is the simple truth, hidden behind the vast complexity of both the ego thought system in our minds and the world that has come from it. Anyone at all can benefit from A Course in Miracles. One does not have to be an intellectual to learn from it and use it as a spiritual path. Nonetheless, it is obvious that it is written on a high intellectual level with sophisticated metaphysical, theological, and psychological concepts integrated into the teaching throughout the three books. Much of it is written in blank verse. Thus, a reader/student who is not intellectually inclined and has no background in these areas might have difficulty understanding a great deal of the material. This does not mean, though, that such a person could not be helped by reading through it and doing the exercises in the workbook. If the person comes away from the Course being more kind, more loving, and reassured of God's Love, and less angry, depressed, and fearful, then its purpose has been fulfilled. On the other hand, there have been many highly educated people who were not able relate to the Course at all. They will find another path more suitable to their needs and inclinations. The Course says of itself that it is only one among many thousands of other forms of the universal course (M-1.4). It does not have to be for everyone. Some religions have claimed that theirs is the only true religion, the only way to be reconciled with God. A Course in Miracles is not among them. Rather, the clear implication throughout the Course is that all people will eventually find a path that will lead them to God. It does not have to be this one. Finally, the structure and flow of the text can be likened more to a symphony with themes introduced, set aside, reintroduced, and developed than to the linear progression of ideas usually found in an academic textbook, which systematically increase in complexity. This results in an interlocking matrix in which every part is integral and essential to the whole, while implicitly containing that whole within itself. Thus, the same material consistently recurs, both within the Course as a thought system as well as in the learning opportunities in our personal lives. The process of learning, therefore, resembles the ascent up a spiral staircase, with the reader led in a circular pattern, each revolution leading higher until the top of the spiral is reached, which opens unto God. The lovely rhythm of blank verse in much of the text enhances the impact of recurring themes. The only specifications for the workbook lessons are given in its Introduction: \"Do not undertake to do more than one set of exercises a day\" (W-in.2:6). It is advisable for students to read this Introduction before beginning the lessons, and to reread it occasionally thereafter. Another important principle in the Introduction pertains to the student's orientation: \"Remember only this; you need not believe the ideas, you need not accept them, and you need not even welcome them. Some of them you may actively resist. None of this will matter, or decrease their efficacy. But do not allow yourself to make exceptions in applying the ideas the workbook contains, and whatever your reactions to the ideas may be, use them. Nothing more than that is required\" (W- in.9). Lessons may be repeated if desired. If it is a particularly meaningful or difficult lesson, it could be a good idea to stay with it for a couple of days or so. However, there is a risk in thinking that a lesson needs to be done perfectly before moving on to the next one. This would be a trap, because it is unlikely that many of us will ever do any of the lessons perfectly. If we could, we would have reached such an advanced state of spiritual growth that we would not need the lessons at all. The middle of Lesson 95 is helpful in knowing what to do if several days or weeks are missed in practicing the lessons. Importantly, it is not necessary to begin all over again. The instruction in Lesson 95 focuses on recognizing the ways in which the ego creeps into the process, and that we ought to respond to \"our lapses in diligence, and our failures to follow the instructions\" (W- pI.95.8:3) with forgiveness. That is the key. Jesus does not keep track of how punctual we are in following the instructions for the day; his interest is only in helping us train our minds to think more and more in terms of forgiveness, and then eventually to generalize our learning to every aspect of our lives and experience. The core idea is that we be sincere in our attempts to study and practice what the workbook teaches, aware that we all have strong resistance, yet are willing to forgive ourselves for our often inadequate efforts. As long as we continue to study and apply the lessons as we are instructed, we will make progress. It is important to focus on the content, rather than the form. What matters is making a sincere effort to follow the instructions as carefully as we can, without judging ourselves when we fail. Indeed, we can say that the purpose of doing the lessons is to do them wrong and then forgive our mistakes. This would reflect our ultimate forgiveness of ourselves for the mistake of separating from our Creator-Source. The manual for teachers, the third book, is the easiest and most approachable of the three. The Course helps us realize that we are all teachers and students of each other, and that there is no line separating teachers and students. As we teach we learn, and as we learn we teach; but this has nothing to do with a formal teaching setting. The meaning is that we teach by demonstration. A Course in Miracles is never concerned with form (body) but only content (mind). The manual comes in question and answer form, with the questions addressing some of the more important themes found in the Course itself. There is an appendix to the manual, which Helen took down a couple years after the Course was completed. This is called the clarification of terms, which in a sense is like a glossary of some of the key terms that are used in the Course, the ostensible purpose being to define them for the Course's students. What one finds, however, is that if one does not already know what the word means, the clarification of terms probably will not be helpful. What it is, however, is a lovely, and many times poetic summary of what these terms mean. It is another way of revisiting what we already have.

    "text_input": "Q #1387: I understand about projection generally. Every person I see and how I see them and their actions, words, and deeds, etc., are all my projection because there is no one out there! What I am unclear about is whether I can be projected upon. If there is no one out there, then I can't be, correct?",
    "output": "A main part of our difficulty in understanding projection is that it is only about the mind outside time and space and not about the individual physical self, the \"I\" with which we are familiar. There really is only one mind and the dynamics of that one mind that believes it has separated from God. That is the level to which the statement \"there is no one out there\" applies; in fact, there is no \"out there,\" and therefore no \"I\" or \"my.\" Now, part of the dynamics of separation involve continual separation to the point where, although there is still only the one mind, there appear to be many minds--yours and mine, etc. Denial and projection are the means used by the mind to preserve its state of separation and conceal the decision it made to separate, lest the decision be re-considered and changed. This means that continual projecting of the contents of the mind is essential. It is essential, in other words, that there be an \"external\" or \"outside\" which these seeming individual minds perceive as real and as responsible for their own state. The endless forms of interaction serve this purpose perfectly! (See T-15.VII.4.) As seeming individuals, it is necessary to our survival (as egos) that we see sin in others (individuals, institutions, God, etc.). That is the nature of our projecting onto others--what we deny in ourselves we see in others and react to there (justified anger, justified fear, and so on). At this level, within the illusion of many individual minds, we all project onto each other. In terms of our practice of forgiveness, however, we learn to take responsibility for everything we experience internally (anger, fear, injustice, victimization, etc.). We still perceive others as real and that they do and say things that have an effect on us, but we learn to distinguish between what they do and how we react, and that our reactions reflect the inner teacher we have chosen to follow: Jesus or the ego. This is the beginning of our ascent up the ladder, at the top of which we finally transcend all sense of individual self, accepting the one mind as the only reality. But this is a process, and we start where we are (see T-25.I.5-7).  An in-depth examination of this key part of the Course's theory can be found in Kenneth's The Message of A Course in Miracles, Volume One, All Are Called, Chapter 4, where he shows the process of splitting-off in the one mind. Briefer presentations are found in his A Talk Given on A Course in Miracles, Chapter 3, and Forgiveness and Jesus, Chapter 1. This is not an easy topic to understand because of our investment in experiencing ourselves as individuals, but we need not understand it fully in order to make progress in our practice of forgiveness. Focusing primarily on that will actually yield a deeper understanding as we go along. Q 1388: Can the Course in Miracles be practiced by non-believers? The first few lessons seemed to promise so much, but when I browsed through the more advanced lessons I found God and religion. Do you have anything to offer non-believers? A: Simply put, yes, A Course in Miracles can be practiced by a non-believer. The Introduction to the clarification of terms at the end of the manual offers an explanation that could be helpful in getting past the religious language of the Course. In part it states: \"This is not a course in philosophical speculation, nor is it concerned with precise terminology. It is concerned only with Atonement, or the correction of perception. The means of the Atonement is forgiveness ... do not let theology delay you\" (C-in.1:1-3; 4:5). Further along in the clarification of terms there is another explanation of the Course's approach which takes its students beyond the boundaries and restrictions common to other systems. It tells us that the names and terms it uses should be regarded as symbols only, which we need because of our own limitations: \"Their names are legion, but we will not go beyond the names the course itself employs\" (C-5.1:6). Thus, those who find the Christian terms unacceptable should feel free to substitute other symbols, as long as the symbols are helpful in transcending the ego or false self. Further discussion of this important issue can be found in Questions #1 and #1347. Our audio program \"Beyond Theism\" may also be of help."
