    "text_input": "Q #1: It seems that at some point all theologies converge, and in so doing, they leave behind their individual forms and become pure Truth. I am having trouble dealing with this because it implies that the Christian forms of the Course are ...(forgive me) ... disposable and temporary. Knowing this I sometimes find myself becoming impatient with the continuous anthropomorphism of the text, and wish it would be more direct. Needless to say, this interferes with my personal progress, though not with my reverence. In your experience is this a common phenomenon? Does it pass with time? Is it just an ego-strategy? How should I handle it?",
    "output": "The Course's Christian context has been a problem for students right from the beginning, and they have raised the same important question you have. To restate and slightly expand your question, why does a universal message have to come in such a specific religious framework? And does that not inevitably breed further separation, at the same time denying the universality of the specific religion? Indeed, the Christian language of A Course in Miracles, not to mention the presence of Jesus throughout the material, can pose a great challenge to many students. If their ego is looking for a way to invalidate the material, or throw up obstacles to learning, then Jesus and Christianity can be helpful allies in this battle against the truth. On the other hand, asking the Holy Spirit for help can introduce yet another classroom in which forgiveness of our specialness can happily be learned. While one would never want to restrict A Course in Miracles to a particular cultural group, it can nonetheless be said that in the main it is directed towards a Western audience. Its language, cultural expressions, and Freudian, Platonic, and Shakespearean elements, all speak to a reader comfortable within the Western tradition. And it can certainly be said that the predominant influence in the Western world for the past two thousand years has been Christianity, with Jesus clearly being the dominant figure, either as symbol of the love of Heaven, or the special love (and hate) of the ego. And so there could not be a Western student--Christian, Jew, agnostic, or atheist--who in one way or another has not been affected by Jesus or the religions that have evolved in his name. Thus the Christian framework of A Course in Miracles provides a natural opportunity for students to practice forgiveness of their past experiences. In the end, of course, all specific symbols disappear into the Oneness of God. But until that day arrives, we need specifics to be the little steps of forgiveness we take towards attaining the non- dualistic reality that lies beyond all dualistic concepts and beyond all symbols. As the workbook says: \"God will take this final step Himself. Do not deny the little steps He asks you take to Him\" (W-pI.193.13:6-7). Thus, the Christian anthropomorphisms reflect our own anthropomorphic view of ourselves, since in truth we are not bodies or specific persons, but non- human thoughts in the mind. However, as long as we identify with the specific person whose image we see every morning in the bathroom mirror, then, again, we need a learning curriculum that uses specific symbols that meet us in the condition in which we think we exist (T-25.I.7:4). Christianity provides us with one of those sets of symbols, and for the opportunity it offers we should all be grateful."

    "text_input": "Q #2: As a relatively new student of the Course, I miss the rituals I used to practice from my religious upbringing. Are there any things that a student can do without violating the teachings of the Course?",
    "output": "It is true that there are no rituals in A Course in Miracles, since its focus is always on changing our minds not our behavior. However, there is certainly nothing inherently \"wrong\" with students practicing anything that fosters their spiritual growth with the Course. There are very, very few shoulds or should nots in the curriculum. As we are told in the manual, \"The curriculum is highly individualized ... \" (M-29.2:6), and so students would do well to follow the guidance of the Holy Spirit. The only caution would be not to have the ritual become a substitute for the inner work. As Jesus states in the workbook: \"Rituals are not our aim, and would defeat our goal\" (W-pI.rvIII.in.2:4). And in the manual: \"Routines as such are dangerous, because they easily become gods in their own right, threatening the very goals for which they were set up.\" (M-16.2:5)."

    "text_input": "Q #3: In my line of work, the degree of adherence to detail and precision make the difference between what is perceived as an amateurish job and a professional job. Yet, I have been told by a number of Course students that my line of work isn't important in the big scheme of things, so I should just \"let it go\" when it comes to administering the quality of the end product. I am confused. Could you please help me understand what I am missing?",
    "output": "What you are missing is that some Course students suffer from what we refer to as \"level confusion.\" This common error confuses the metaphysical teachings of the Course (Level 1) with the part of the Course that deals only with the illusory dream (Level II). In your question, Level 1 is represented by the \"big scheme of things\" i.e., \"Nothing unreal exists\" (T-in.2:3), and Level 2 is represented by you and your line of work, i.e., a body living in a world controlled by a standard of good and bad. As long as you believe you are in this world, it is important that you do the best you can in whatever roles you have chosen. Your specific roles are what constitute the classroom that the Holy Spirit can use to teach you forgiveness. Without the specifics, we can never get to the One Who is beyond the world entirely. Nonetheless, it is relieving to know that, in the end, the work you do does not matter. What matters is with whom you do it. And you can tell with whom you have worked by whether you are peaceful or anxious."

    "text_input": "Q #4: After reading your Lighthouse article \"September 11th and the Aftermath\" (December 2001), I wonder: Is it ever possible for a Course student to wage a war against terrorists and not be on the actual battlefield with the ego but to be with Jesus instead?",
    "output": "Yes, it is possible in principle, since A Course in Miracles is not a course in behavior, but rather a course in changing how we think; or better yet, with whom we think. To believe otherwise is to say that there is a situation in the world that the Holy Spirit or Jesus cannot use as an opportunity for us to learn forgiveness. Considering it takes two people, each joined with the ego, to create a battlefield, one person choosing to think with Jesus would eliminate the battlefield. At that point one would not be waging a war, but rather, paraphrasing from the text, putting a limit on one's ability to miscreate (T-2.III.3:3). As stated in the article, \"There is a way of halting aggression, whether it is on the individual or world level, that can be firm and resolute, and yet still be kind.\" This way is through joining with Jesus. With Jesus by our side, we would see the terrorists as fearful, rather than evil. Recognizing their call for help and love, we would perform whatever action, or inaction, Jesus' love would guide us toward."

    "text_input": "Q #5: So what's with all of the male gender-specific language? So far I've not come across one reference to 50% of the world's population. Or are females just another illusion? I still love the Course, but this gender language thing is an annoyance.",
    "output": "This question is similar to #10 found in the Foundation's publication, The Most Commonly Asked Questions About A Course in Miracles, authored by Gloria and Kenneth Wapnick. A slightly modified answer from this book is that Jesus does not practice the art of \"political correctness.\" Rather, his Course is written linguistically within the male-dominated Judaeo- Christian tradition, and uses the patriarchal biblical language on which that tradition is based. Consequently, the Course conforms to this religious culture by using terms that are exclusively masculine. Jesus himself speaks of his use of ego-oriented language: \"This course remains within the ego framework, where it is needed. ... It uses words, which are symbolic, and cannot express what lies beyond symbols\" (C-in.3:1-3). And so it is clear that the Course's meaning in using this masculine language lies elsewhere. While the form of the Course's words is the same as the twenty-five-hundred-year-old Western tradition, its content is exactly the opposite. This provides a good example of a principle enunciated twice in the text, that the Holy Spirit does not take our special relationships (the form) away from us, but instead transforms them (by changing their purpose--the content) (T- 17.IV.2:3-6; T-18.II.6). Therefore, the reader is given a wonderful opportunity to practice forgiveness by having whatever buried judgmental thoughts are unconsciously present be raised to awareness by the Course's \"sexist\" language, so that they may now be looked at differently with the Holy Spirit's help. In this way, a special hate (or love) relationship with patriarchal authorities--religious or secular--may be transformed into a holy relationship, the relationship now having forgiveness and peace as its purpose, instead of judgment and attack. In like manner, we can understand the Course's usage of the term Son of God. For two thousand years, it has exclusively been used in Christian theology to denote only Jesus, the biblical God's only begotten Son, and Second Person of the Trinity. Moreover, Jesus' specialness was accentuated by St. Paul's relegating the rest of humanity to the status of \"adopted sons\" of God (Galatians 4:4). To accentuate the point that he is our equal, Jesus in A Course in Miracles uses the same term that heretofore had excluded everyone except himself. Now, however, it denotes all people: God's children who yet believe they are bodies and separate from their Source and therefore different from Him. And even more specifically, the term Son of God denotes the students who are reading and studying A Course in Miracles, a usage clearly made regardless of their gender. This term is thus deliberately used to help correct two thousand years of what A Course in Miracles sees as Christianity's distortion of Jesus' basic message, in this case the perfect equality and unity of the Sonship of God. And so in the Course Jesus presents himself as no different from anyone else in reality (although certainly he is different from us in time). Therefore, to state it once again, the same term--Son of God--that was used only for Jesus is now used for all of us. Moreover, the term is also used to denote Christ, God's pre-separation creation, His one Son. Again, we see usage of the same form as in traditional Christianity, but with a totally different content. The phrase Son of God can also be easily understood as synonymous with child, a term which is also often used in the Course. The reinterpretation of Son of God from exclusive to totally inclusive is crucial to the Course's thought system. And because of Jesus' reason for using this term, students--men and women alike--should be vigilant against the temptation to change the Course's \"offensive\" language. While such practice is understandable, it does serve to undermine one of Jesus' pedagogical purposes. It would be much more in keeping with the teachings of A Course in Miracles to leave the form as it is, and change one's mind instead. In these circumstances, one would do well to paraphrase a famous line from the text: Therefore, seek not to change the course, but choose to change your mind about the course (T-21.in.1:7). Therefore, since the Course's form will not be changed, students would be wise to use their reactions as a classroom in which they can learn to forgive, not only Jesus, Helen, or A Course in Miracles itself, but also all those in the past (or present) who have been perceived as treating them or others unfairly. One final note on the subject of the Course's masculine language: It has long been a grammatical convention that pronouns referring back to a neuter noun, such as \"one\" or \"person,\" take the masculine form of \"he.\" Clearly, since a central teaching of A Course in Miracles is that we are not bodies, the issue, once again, is merely one of form or style."

    "text_input": "Q #6: Can you please explain how and why the Course is unlike any other spiritual path? I have studied other non-dualistic teachings but seem to always come back to the Course.",
    "output": "First, let us say that by non-duality we mean that A Course in Miracles recognizes only one dimension of reality--spirit and the state of perfect oneness, what the Course refers to as the realm of knowledge. Everything else--the dualistic world of separation and perception, of form and matter, of thinking and concepts--is illusion, and thus does not really exist. This non-dualism is what you find in the higher teachings of Hinduism and Buddhism, but rarely in the West. What makes A Course in Miracles unique as a spiritual system--ancient and contemporary--is its integration of this non-dualistic metaphysics with a sophisticated psychology, heavily based on the insights of Freud and his followers. This means essentially that at the same time that the Course teaches that the world is an illusion and is nothing but a dream, outside the Mind of God, we are urged to practice our daily lessons of forgiveness, paying careful attention to our everyday experiences here. Key to this integration is the Course's emphasis on purpose, the introduction of which idea sets A Course in Miracles apart from other spiritual paths. The Course teaches that not only is the world an illusion, but that it is a purposive illusion; the purpose being to make a world of bodies, thoroughly focused on solving the myriad number of physical and psychological problems that beset us daily, clamoring for attention and solution. In this way the mind, the true source of our problems, is kept hidden from awareness. In addition, A Course in Miracles is unique among spiritualities in its insistence that we look at the ego--the dark side--as the way of moving beyond to the light. Its focus, therefore, is not on the truth, but on removing our ego's thought system of guilt, fear, and attack, which allows the light of truth to shine. As Jesus teaches in one representative passage: \"Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all of the barriers within yourself that you have built against it. It is not necessary to seek for what is true, but it is necessary to seek for what is false\" (T- 16.IV.6:1-2)."

    "text_input": "Q #7: How does one forgive oneself? I have a pen pal in prison who is new to the Course. He is in prison for assaulting his girlfriend. He says he is learning to forgive others but not himself. He is angry and ashamed of himself for hurting her. I can see his actions as a \"call for love,\" a mistake to be corrected and not a sin to be punished. He no doubt was a victim who became a victimizer, and keeps reliving it now. I would tell him to let it go--\"Brother, choose again.\" But could I say this to myself? I have dealt with depression most of my life and guilt is a familiar companion. My ego's accusations seem overwhelming when I do one thing wrong. I see when I project my guilt onto others and I know it's not helpful to blame and accuse myself when I judge others. But what if I really hurt someone else in some way? I could try to make amends and move on, but I don't think my ego would let me off the hook that easily. I seem only to be able to release myself from guilt by experiencing pain for the length of time my ego dictates. I know there has to be \"another way.\" Why am I kind to others and mean to myself?  To top it all off, I seek my addictions to get some relief from the pain of the guilt, and then I feel guilty for indulging in the addiction. I need a way out of this. Can we project guilt onto ourselves as well as others? I know I will come to understand why I don't love myself and why I even hate myself at times. I am still learning. It is ironic that, as my friend in prison is trying to forgive himself, I am in my own prison trying to do the same.",
    "output": "It does seem that as we learn more and more to release others from the projections of our own guilt, we then feel stuck with the guilt ourselves. Jesus tells us that \"as blame is withdrawn from without, there is a strong tendency to harbor it within\" (T-11.IV.4:5). But he goes on to say, \"It is difficult at first to realize that this is exactly the same thing, for there is no distinction between within and without\" (4:6), and then, \"Blame must be undone, not seen elsewhere\" (5:3). So how do we do that? The question you raise, \"How does one forgive oneself?\" is a good one, but it is actually the wrong question. Because we are still so strongly identified with our egos, we can not forgive ourselves, at least not by ourselves (i.e., on our own, which is the ego state). That is why we need Jesus or the Holy Spirit, or whatever nonjudgmental symbol of love and acceptance we feel comfortable with, to look with us at our \"sins.\" We need someone outside of our guilt-based thought system who knows the truth about who we really are, to whom we can give our guilt, once we have uncovered it and recognized its purpose and its cost. We believe that we are bodies that can hurt and be hurt by each other. Jesus knows we are spirit, the guiltless Son of God who is incapable of attack. We don't believe that and in fact we don't want to believe it, because we still want the separation and our own individuality to be real. And so the forgiveness process must involve joining with someone or something outside of ourselves, such as Jesus, who knows separation and attack and guilt are not real. We are incapable of this realization on our own, by definition. The ego, as you are experiencing it for yourself, tells us that we need to atone for our sins through suffering and sacrifice. But that only reinforces our belief that our guilt is real and that God is a punishing God who seeks revenge for our very real sins. And all of our attempts then to gain release through expiation are just forms of magic that fail to address the real problem in the mind. We need to understand that the problem is not the guilt we believe we are experiencing for our transgressions here in the world. Those \"sins\" are really deliberate distractions, serving the purpose of keeping our focus here in the world, looking for magical solutions to release our guilt (e.g., making amends) or to avoid experiencing it (e.g., addictions). But these only prevent us from looking deeper into our mind to the real source of all of our pain and guilt (and everyone else's)--the belief that we have not only separated ourselves from our loving Source, but that we have been willing to kill Him, to destroy Love, to be on our own. However, if we can join with a reflection of that Love, such as Jesus or the Holy Spirit, and look at our self-accusations with their loving presence beside us, we will have to realize at some level that we have not destroyed love. And in that recognition, real forgiveness--for what has never happened--is possible, dissolving all guilt and releasing us from our self-imposed prison. And then whatever action or behavior, if any, may be most helpful and healing in response to our so- called transgressions against others in the world will simply flow through us."

    "text_input": "Q #8: When we try to look at our ego, shall we look without judgment at the problems of the world or shall we only realize that we choose the ego? Or is this the same?",
    "output": "Your questions presuppose that one can choose the ego and look without judgment, which is only possible if one is in a state of denial. The ego knows only judgment, which is based on its fundamental mistake of making the error real. What you want to do is live your life by paying attention to what you think and how you feel. If you find yourself getting angry, fearful, gleeful, etc. from problems in the world, whether personal or general, recognize that you have chosen the ego. It is this recognition that is the \"looking.\" You look at your ego's choices with Jesus beside you. You look without judgment as illustrated in this quote: \"Call it not sin but madness, for such it was and so it still remains. Invest it not with guilt, for guilt implies it was accomplished in reality. And above all, be not afraid of it\" (T-18.I.6:7-9). Remembering that the ego is a choice, you simply acknowledge the choice you have made without giving it power to take away your peace."

    "text_input": "Q #9: If the ego destroys love like Jesus and his message, then why hasn't Mother Teresa been attacked if she is extending love?",
    "output": "The ego cannot \"destroy\" love, though it does seem to attack love's symbols in the world (Jesus and his message). In spite of the attacks on the historical Jesus, or any attacks on his true message since then, neither his love nor his message has been destroyed. The ego's attacks have no effect on the content. Mother Teresa's extension of love (or anyone's) is invulnerable to attack; whether she be attacked in form or not is irrelevant. She may indeed have been attacked or threatened during her lifetime. The particular form her love took during her life was in fact criticized. The theology and belief system that inspired her is also a form that has been attacked. None of these, however, has had any effect on the loving content of her work or her message. As the Course says: \"How weak is fear; how little and how meaningless. How insignificant before the quiet strength of those whom love has joined! This is your 'enemy,'--a frightened mouse that would attack the universe. How likely is it that it will succeed? Can it be difficult to disregard its feeble squeaks that tell of its omnipotence, and would drown out the hymn of praise to its Creator that every heart throughout the universe forever sings as one?\" (T-22.V.4:1-5)"

    "text_input": "Q #10: We have received a number of questions on the theme of the ego's origin, examples of which are below.  If Heaven and the Love of God were completely satisfying, why would the Son choose to dream he left?  If God is perfect and unified, and has a perfect and unified Son, how could an imperfect thought of separation and division have possibly arisen within such a mind?  Once the Atonement is accepted, how do we know the ego won't be chosen again?  How can one achieve \"an experience\" which the Course says will resolve the ego paradox?",
    "output": "The first three questions above#91, are actually statements made by an ego mind enunciating the following: I know the ego is real, and now I want you to explain how it happened and how you know it won't happen again. The question \"how did the ego happen,\" and all its variations, is undoubtedly the most frequently asked question of students of A Course in Miracles. This is only natural to an ego wanting to know where it came from, just as a child would question its parents about its origin. The problem is that the ego itself is not natural. The Course teaches us that in reality the ego never happened. Consequently, how could we ever find an intellectually satisfying answer to the ego's origin between the Course's covers? Those asking how the impossible could ever have happened must identify themselves as separate and individual beings, while anyone answering the question must also agree that the separation did indeed happen. Furthermore, if it happened once, it could happen ad infinitum, and in some respects it does. Day in and day out we are offered the choice of believing in the reality of ourselves as an ego or as a Son of God. Therefore, to wonder about the separation recurring is to make the same mistake of believing it happened in the first place. As the Course says: \"Who asks you to define the ego and explain how it arose can be but he who thinks it real, and seeks by definition to ensure that its illusive nature is concealed behind the words that seem to make it so. There is no definition for a lie that serves to make it true\" (C-2.2:5-3:1). \"The ego will demand many answers that this course does not give. It does not recognize as questions the mere form of a question to which an answer is impossible. The ego may ask, 'How did the impossible occur?,' 'To what did the impossible happen?', and may ask this in many forms. Yet there is no answer; only an experience. Seek only this, and do not let theology delay you\" (C-in.4). God's Love is the experience the Course speaks of in the quote above. This experience is attained through the process of forgiveness, which removes the blocks to the awareness of love's presence (T-in.1:7). Indeed, the purpose of A Course in Miracles is to help us attain this experience."

    "text_input": "Q #11: In seeking the \"Voice\" of the Holy Spirit is there any particular method or practice that facilitates the hearing of this Voice? A Course in Miracles seems to say that few ever even hear it and this seems to inhibit the practice of forgiveness.",
    "output": "The greatest obstacle to hearing the Voice of the Holy Spirit is the ego's raucous shrieking. The Course tells us the Holy Spirit is \"a still small Voice\" (T-21.V.1:6). Rather than seeking this Voice (which is always with us) we can practice forgiveness by paying attention to the thoughts giving voice to the shrieking in our minds, which is drowning out the Voice of the Holy Spirit. The thoughts of separation, judgment, and attack can be seen for what they are; attempts to defend our ego identity, prove that we are right and God is wrong, guilt is justified, just to name a few. Recognizing these thoughts and accepting responsibility for having chosen them for the specific purpose of not hearing the Holy Spirit's Voice is the beginning of the practice of forgiveness and of hearing His Voice. If we want to, we then have the opportunity to choose to listen to the Holy Spirit's Voice, which may not actually be a voice, but perhaps the recognition that I am wrong about how I see a situation, person or event, and being willing to see it differently. In this moment then, the recognition, the willingness and the seeing differently is the Voice of the Holy Spirit. Everyone is called to hear the Holy Spirit in this way. Few may hear the Voice of the Holy Spirit as an actual voice, which is not necessary for the practice of forgiveness."

    "text_input": "Q #12: I have been studying the Course for some years now, and being a psychologist would like to establish a workshop and/or a support group for people trying to live according to its principles. My idea is basically to help people see their projections on others and then make a group effort of asking for help to the Holy Spirit. Would this type of work be in accordance to  the principles of the Course and do you have any more suggestions or opinions? I know I have to teach what I need to learn.",
    "output": "The bottom line answer to your question is that there are no guidelines in A Course in Miracles for behavior; i.e., \"What should I do?\" Jesus reminds us that his is a course in cause (the mind), and not in effect (the body, or behavior) (T-21.VII.7:8). Thus, our only function is to ask for help in getting our egos out of the way so that we may be free to be guided in whatever action (or non-action) would be most helpful and loving to all people involved in the situation. The following statement is representative of this all-important Course teaching: \"Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all of the barriers within yourself that you have built against it. It is not necessary to seek for what is true, but it is necessary to seek for what is false\" (T-16.IV.6:1-2). And so, before knowing how you should (or should not) proceed with your thought of starting a group, bring to the Holy Spirit any ego investment you might have in having such a group. When you are reasonably sure your ego is safely out of the way, then simply follow His guidance. One other point: a temptation in any group, especially the kind that you envision, is to circumvent the difficult individual effort students are asked to make in order to bring their egos to the Holy Spirit by diluting the process and displacing the \"work\" onto the group. At best, groups facilitate this individual work we are all asked to do; at worst, they depreciate the power of our minds to change our decisions and misperceptions, not to mention reinforce the ego's specialness. Good luck!"

  {
    "text_input": "Q #13: What do you think the phrase \"purification is necessary first\" means?",
    "output": "Since this seventh miracle principle, \"Miracles are everyone's right, but purification is necessary first\" (T-1.I.7:1) comes on page 3 of the text, students of A Course in Miracles may believe that Jesus is speaking about purification of the body. Students' past experiences will bring to mind all of their beliefs about the meaning of the word \"purification.\" To some, this may mean the cleansing of the \"soul\" through baptism, or the atonement of sin through penance and sacrifice. To others, \"purification\" may have the connotation of ridding oneself of human desires through meditation and disciplined practices. Whatever one believes, their belief forms the foundation on which they begin to build their understanding of the \"purification process.\" What a surprise to learn, as we make our way through the text, that Jesus is not speaking to us about purifying the body at all. He couldn't be since the Course teaches that the body is an illusion. And being an illusion, there is nothing that we have to do to it or with it. The body does not need to be purified because it is not impure. \"It does nothing. Of itself it is neither corruptible nor incorruptible. It is nothing\" (T-19.IV-C.5:3-5). What is impure are our thoughts, which means it is our thoughts that have to be purified, not the body. And the Course's method of \"purification\" is forgiveness; forgiveness of the one thought of guilt which keeps us separate from the love of God. The Course's \"purification process\" is illustrated in this quote: \"Give Him your thoughts, and He will give them back as miracles which joyously proclaim the wholeness and the happiness God wills His Son, as proof of His eternal Love. And as each thought is thus transformed, it takes on healing power from the Mind which saw the truth in it, and failed to be deceived by what was falsely added [guilt]. All the threads of fantasy are gone. And what remains is unified into a perfect Thought that offers its perfection everywhere\" (W- pI.151.14)."

    "text_input": "Q #14: Please explain the many passages about healing that seem to refer to healing of the body. It seems to me that, although the Course is very clear about the process of healing our minds of the misperception of our reality, it is equally clear that a healthy body is an effect of a mind that is healed. How does this translate into our personal lives as Course students? I would be satisfied to totally disregard my body and it's condition were it not for these many passages. I am left wondering, that although the goal of a healed body is not the point of the teachings, it seems to be something that we can expect as we follow the Voice of the Holy Spirit. Why does Jesus even bother to mention this, if it is not something that we should consider?",
    "output": "You are correct in saying that a healed body is not the point of Jesus' teachings, nor should it be the goal of our practice of the Course. Jesus talks about the body so much not because he thinks it is important or real, but because we think it is important and have not recognized its purpose in the ego's strategy of keeping us away from our minds. A major part of the ego's strategy is to have us think that our bodies are completely vulnerable to outside forces--that both sickness and healing come from the outside. Jesus therefore is correcting this by teaching us about the cause and effect relationship between the mind and the body. That is the point of all of his references to a healed body. The focus really is on the power of our minds, not on having a healed and whole body: \"The miracle is useless if you learn but that the body can be healed, for this is not the lesson it was sent to teach. The lesson is the mind was sick that thought the body could be sick; projecting out its guilt caused nothing, and had no effects\" (T-28.II.11:6-7). This is his point. But he is teaching us about the Holy Spirit's thought system in the context of what we know best and can relate to best; and for just about all of us that is the world of bodies. He thus uses our bodies to teach us, ultimately, that we are not our bodies. That awareness, however, comes at the end of a long process, which for most of us, takes many, many years to complete. To simply disregard our bodies, therefore, would be to deny ourselves a multitude of opportunities to learn and apply the principles of the Course. Our physical / psychological needs and experiences constitute the curriculum that Jesus can use to teach us how to interpret and perceive our bodily experiences in a way that will help us undo the separation rather than reinforce it. As long as we still think that without oxygen and food we will die, then we still believe we are bodies, and it would be detrimental to our spiritual advancement to ignore or disregard what we still think is real. As Jesus cautioned us in this regard, \"The body is merely part of your experience in the physical world. Its abilities can be and frequently are overevaluated. However, it is almost impossible to deny its existence in this world. Those who do so are engaging in a particularly unworthy form of denial\" (T-2.IV.3:8-11). The focus, once again, is always on the training of our minds and the way we think, so that at the end, we simply will no longer choose to be limited. This is quite different from merely disregarding the body. As he says in the section \"Beyond the Body\" in Chapter 18: \"What really happens is that you have given up the illusion of a limited awareness, and lost your fear of union\" (T-18.VI.11:7). He is teaching us how to get to this stage."

    "text_input": "Q #15: I want to change my mind about death. I just had several loved ones \"gently lay their bodies aside\" yet it is grief that I am drawn to. Grief is not love, therefore it does not exist. Right? I must have made it? Can you articulate for me, based on various Course passages, a general response that would incorporate the Course's theories so that I may apply them to this experience of grief in the world of illusion. What about repression and denial of this experience?",
    "output": "The Course never asks us to repress or deny what we are experiencing, whether it be grief or anger or pain or fear or any other ego-based reaction. But before we can change our mind about our feelings, we need first to understand what purpose they serve and why we have chosen to experience them. The feeling of grief reinforces the ego's assertion that loss and death are real and that we can be and are deprived of love. Our experience cries out that Jesus is wrong, that we have been hurt and abandoned and left on our own. We are not being asked to deny that this is our experience. But that does not make it true. In a graphic description of the world, Jesus says: \"The world you see is the delusional system of those made mad by guilt ... all the laws that seem to govern it are the laws of death. Children are born into it through pain and in pain. Their growth is attended by suffering, and they learn of sorrow and separation and death. Their minds seem to be trapped in their brain, and its powers to decline if their bodies are hurt. They seem to love, yet they desert and are deserted. They appear to lose what they love, perhaps the most insane belief of all. And their bodies wither and gasp and are laid in the ground, and are no more. Not one of them but has thought that God is cruel\" (T-13.in.2:2,4-11). And this is what we all believe. Would it not be better if we are wrong? Jesus reminds us that his life, ending in apparent death, had the purpose of \"teaching that communication remains unbroken even if the body is destroyed, provided that you see not the body as the necessary means of communication\" (T-15.XI.7:2). But we still see the body as necessary for communication and believe that real communication ends with the death of the body, because we still want to see ourselves as a body. The body affirms our independent existence and its seeming experiences of loss and pain do not seem to reflect simply a choice in our minds. The ego does not want us to remember that the source of all our grief is the belief that we ourselves abandoned love and exiled ourselves from Heaven. Thanks to the ego defense of projection, it feels instead as if these are things that happen to us against our own will, that we are not responsible for how we feel. So we must begin by acknowledging that these are our feelings, but then we must also have a willingness to question whether our interpretation of the world and the events of our lives is correct. The shift away from our pain and grief is a gradual process because we are afraid of the limitlessness of love, in which our individual lives, our personal selves with our unique personalities, have no meaning. And so Jesus gently reminds us both of the eventual outcome and the process: \"Loss is not loss when properly perceived. Pain is impossible. There is no grief with any cause at all. And suffering of any kind is nothing but a dream. This is the truth, at first to be but said and then repeated many times; and next to be accepted as but partly true, with many reservations. Then to be considered seriously more and more, and finally accepted as the truth\" (W- pII.284.1:1-6, italics added). These words are not simply to be used as a \"holy mantra\" proclaiming what is true in order to drown out our ego's interpretation and the accompanying feelings of loss and grief. Implicit in the process of changing our mind is the necessary but at times very unsettling task of looking at what we still want to believe and recognizing both its purpose--to keep separation and guilt alive--and its cost to us--suffering and pain. It is from a growing recognition of what we inflict on ourselves when we accept the ego as our teacher that the motivation develops to ask for help from a different Teacher. With that help, we can begin to see the losses of our lives in a different light, realizing that we do have a choice about what we experience and that we are not the victims of circumstances beyond our control."

    "text_input": "Q #16: When I tell myself in meditation that I'm not a body and I'm free I feel peace of mind. But once I open my eyes, there it is--my body. This doesn't upset me as much as it confuses me. When I look at myself I feel I'm beautiful, but I worry that I might be just feeding the ego again rather than appreciating what I have. It's a puzzle. Any thoughts on this?",
    "output": "Although the Course tells us in many places that we are not a body (e.g., Lesson 199 and the following review lessons), it also recognizes that we have a strong investment in seeing ourselves as a body. Jesus observes, \"Look at yourself and you will see a body. ... without a light it seems that it is gone. Yet you are reassured that it is there because you still can feel it with your hands and hear it move. Here is an image that you want to be yourself. It is the means to make your wish come true\" (T-24.VII.9:1,3-6 italics added). We may have brief experiences where we seem to transcend our bodily identification, as you describe, but we are not likely to maintain this for any length of time because we really don't want to. Our \"wish come true\" is seeing ourselves as a separate, special, individual self and our body affirms that identity. The Course tells us that although we are the ones who have chosen and made this limited self as our identity (in fantasy but not in reality), we have not wanted to accept responsibility for that decision. And that is because buried deep in our unconscious is the (made-up) belief that we gained this separate self by attacking the Oneness of God and our true Identity as spirit, a horrendous sin of destruction and murder according to our ego. So once we seem to be bodies born to other bodies, our separate existence does not seem at all to be of our own making. Our parents made us. And we may even believe, much to our ego's delight, that somehow God has been involved in this special \"creation\" of our individual self, as many religions teach. So the Course's goal, knowing how strongly identified we are with our body and how fearful we are of letting go of the protection we believe it affords us, is not to have us relinquish our bodily identification (that happens only at the very end). The Course is instructing us in how to give our body a purpose different from the ego's original purpose of sin, guilt and fear. With the help of the Holy Spirit, the body becomes a vehicle for learning our lessons of forgiveness, in the context of our relationships with our brothers and sisters, also seen as bodies. And we will continue to see ourselves and everyone else as a body until the forgiveness process is complete and we no longer have any guilt in our mind that we need our body as a defense against. And as to seeing yourself as beautiful, there is nothing wrong with that, so long as you realize that when the Course speaks of how beautiful we are (e.g., W-pII.313.2:2), it is not speaking of our physical body or our personality. It is referring to the reflected beauty of the Christ in all of us, a beauty which we all share equally as spirit."

    "text_input": "Q #17: I heard that in the real world the separation is seen, but separate interests are not. Is that true? What does that actually mean? Which came first: the separation or the guilt? (I imagine the separation.) Can the guilt be undone without undoing the separation or are they all tied together? You see I'd quite like to get rid of the guilt ... and seeing my brother's interests as my own sounds good since it ends the terrible sense of conflict and competition ...but losing my individuality does not feel like a price I am willing to pay. I would rather be a non-guilty, non- conflicted, non-competitive, non-frightened, happy, individual. Is that possible?",
    "output": "First, you are correct in concluding that the separation came before guilt--guilt is simply the psychological experience of sin--the feeling that results from being sinful. Most students reach this same impasse that you have described. What you are feeling is quite normal and understandable, given the strength of our identification with our existence as specific individuals. For the most part, we know no other way of being and find it quite difficult--to put it mildly--to integrate Jesus' teaching that this identity is a replacement for our true Identity as God created us. So Jesus emphasizes throughout the Course that this is a gradual, gentle process, and we can take as long as we would like to complete it with him. He comforts us by saying: \"Fear not that you will be abruptly lifted up and hurled into reality\" (T-16.VI.8:1), because he knows well that we are terrified of letting go of this identity. As we choose to forgive more and more--to let go of grievances--we will feel better about ourselves, and therefore we will want to do that more and more. And as that process continues, we will begin to identify more and more with Jesus' way of thinking and approaching our lives, which means that our point of reference for our lives will gradually shift from simply having our needs met to realizing that we all share a common interest, both in our wrong minds and in our right minds. As we become less and less preoccupied with using the world and other people to meet our needs--i.e., as we see the purpose of our lives differently--our self-concept will begin to shift, without our even having focused directly on that. When we become totally identified with Jesus' way of thinking, our only attraction will be to his love. And when all of our thinking and perceptions flow from that love, our sense of individuality will be meaningful only to the extent that it can be a means of extending Jesus' healing love to other minds that are calling out for it. That is the state of mind known as \"the real world.\" It is the natural outcome of the practice of forgiveness. So when we reach that advanced stage, we will no longer be thinking of ourselves as persons with needs and goals that have to be fulfilled. We will perceive from a vantage point \"above the battleground\" only people who are calling out for love, not knowing they are simply figures in a dream that they themselves are dreaming."

    "text_input": "Q #18: The Course speaks throughout about will. It states that will is not involved in perception (C-1.7:2); that I have imprisoned my will (T-9.I.4:1); and that if I did not have a split mind, I would recognize that willing is salvation (T-9.I.5:4). Just what is will as it is related in the Course, and what purpose, if any, does it serve in the dream?",
    "output": "When the Course speaks of \"will\" it is always referring to God's Will; \"God's Will is all there is\" (C-3.6:1). It is speaking on the level of the Mind where our will is one with God's, where truth is true and everything else is false (T-31.I.1:7). This is an example of the Course's non- dualism; there cannot be a will apart from God's, His Will is our salvation, our true will is one with His. We are \"willing,\" i.e., exercising the power of our will, only when we choose to accept the truth about ourselves, and this is our salvation. The Course distinguishes between willing and wanting. When we choose to make sin real, to believe the ego's lie about who we are in the dream, we are \"wanting\" to make an illusory alternative to God's Will and to defend this made- up self. This is the imprisonment of our true will; this is how we deny it, and this is the origin of perception--we see what we want to see. To help us in our learning, the Course uses a related term, \"the little willingness,\" in reference to our experience in the dream. Being willing, in this sense, is agreeing to choose to see differently; to accept a different interpretation; to question the meaning and value we place on all our relationships, and our entire experience in this dream; to see the effects of the ego choices we have made, and consider their cost. This is enough, the Course tells us, to turn us around in our journey, heading back in the direction of our home in God and the one Will we share with Him; He is our Father, we are His innocent Son. In this way we can make choices in the dream, in the practice and application of the Course that put us in tune with the Will we share with God."

    "text_input": "Q #19: The Course, as I understand it, says that at the base of all our suffering lies guilt, and that this guilt is repressed. The Course then seems to suggest that this guilt be dealt with through forgiveness of the external world (rather than by means of a process of uncovering it such as psychoanalysis). If so, of what use at all is the idea of guilt, if it appears to remain at a purely theoretical level?",
    "output": "The guilt the Course is talking about is an ontological guilt that comes from believing that we could separate from God but in so doing He had to be destroyed--separate individual existence and total Oneness are mutually exclusive states that can not coexist. Since the separation from God is only an illusion, and a fragile one at that, a seemingly powerful defense was needed to maintain its seeming reality. All-consuming guilt over our lethal attack upon the All became that defense, burying the question of whether in reality we had or could have attacked. But this guilt is not simply a theoretical construct according to the Course. The Course says that the external world was literally made from that ontological guilt, as a seeming projection outward of what was too horrible to maintain within the mind. So when we practice the process of forgiveness with our external relationships in the world, we are actually addressing, albeit in a piecemeal fashion, aspects of that original ontological guilt. It is an indirect approach with a practical and direct effect on the underlying problem. By seeing what we have made real in our external world as a projection of what is buried in our unconscious, we are actually making that buried guilt, over time, conscious. This undoes the ego strategy of distracting us from the guilt in our mind with the problems and associated guilt in the world. And it allows us to begin to recognize that the underlying premise, that we are separate and Love has been destroyed, from which that basic guilt has been generated, is simply not true. The process of uncovering guilt within psychoanalysis, as generally practiced, actually plays into the ego's defensive game plan, although it could be directed to the same end as the Course's. The guilt it is seeking to uncover is still part of the external smokescreen of the world that the ego mind has constructed to keep us from getting back to the real problem in the mind. It is guilt still related to the body and its relationships to other bodies, and this guilt is still an effect and not the underlying ontological cause that the Course is addressing."

    "text_input": "Q #20: I would like to understand why many of my relationships with men begin with a notion of romance but do not sustain themselves as friendships. I value the people I meet and I would like to develop and grow to the point where I can express brotherly love for women and men. As a single woman, I meet men who are often attracted to me, then we date or whatever, and then it ends. I'm responsible for what and how I am communicating. Is there a way to communicate \"let's be friends\" when something more was expected or desired and disappointment has set in?",
    "output": "Our egos are not proud and will use whatever forms of specialness work to get us involved in relationships that in the end do not meet our needs. Although we are usually not aware of this, we have an underlying goal of demonstrating that love can only fail us and that we are the unwitting victim of others' misleading and confusing overtures. The Course is unique--and for this reason probably also not that popular--among spiritual paths in identifying this underlying intent behind all our relationships in the world, no matter how good we believe our intentions may be at the start, until they are given over to the Holy Spirit for healing. And, often to our disappointment, the Holy Spirit only works with content and not form, so that there can be no guarantee of what will happen in our relationships except that we will be given another opportunity to get in touch with our own buried guilt and feelings of unworthiness and self-hatred so that they can be healed. But if we are able to put the Course's principles of forgiveness into practice, we will find that over time we experience a sense of peace and joy in our relationships, regardless of whether our brothers or sisters reciprocate in any way on the level of form. And we will know that we are truly \"friends\" who have a shared purpose of healing the pain buried in our minds. But this is a process that can take time to achieve. So, in the meantime, just know that you are doing the best that you can and don't stop trying. Jesus needs our special relationships to teach us the other way. It is only fear that ever stops any of us from allowing ourselves to experience greater intimacy in any form."

    "text_input": "Q #21: If art may be seen as a form of special relationship the artist makes as a substitute for God's Love, are forms of art to be considered as a call for love? And how do these forms differ from the forms expressed through \"channeling\" like Mozart's music? Can we say that the \"channeled\" art is more of an expression of love rather than a call for love? And how can we \"justify\" human distinction between great and mediocre art on Level Two of our experience here in material world?",
    "output": "First, we cannot judge whether the specific work of a specific artist is a substitute for God's Love, the manifestation of a special relationship. Only the artist would be able to discern that. We usually cannot tell just from the form whether it has come from the wrong (ego) mind or the right (Holy Spirit) mind. If the reflection of God's Love is the source of a particular work of art, then, yes, it is an expression of love. Our mistake would be, then, to venerate the work, rather than to identify with the content behind the form. All special love relationships are defenses against the searing pain in our minds that comes from the guilt we all feel over having rejected God's Love in favor of giving ourselves existence on our own terms. Following the ego's counsel, our attention gets directed away from our guilt- laden minds to specific individuals, substances, or activities that can shut out the pain and fill up the loneliness that is in our minds. In essence, our special love relationships are telling God that we don't need His Love, and that we are perfectly capable of filling the void and experiencing completion and worth through relationships in the world. This is the content underlying the form of all special love relationships. The good feelings that come from these types of relationships hide the hatred that is their basis. At the same time, in another part of our minds, we are longing to be told that this whole thing was just some silly mistake, that we have been forgiven, and therefore our guilt and our defenses against that guilt are no longer necessary. This is the \"call\" that is present in our minds that are split between these two attitudes or ways of thinking. Any form can be used by the Holy Spirit to remind us of the truth about ourselves. One is not more or less inspiring than another, in this sense. In other words, once we believe the separation has occurred and we are here in the world as bodies, the world and our bodies are regarded as neutral. Therefore, anything at all in this world can become a means of leading us beyond the world, or more deeply into it, depending on whether we choose the ego or the Holy Spirit as our teacher. We can be enthralled with Michelangelo's statue of David and be reminded of our perfection and oneness with God; but the same experience can occur while we are looking at a diseased tree in our yard. When we become dependent on a particular form in order to have a \"spiritual\" experience, then we have gotten caught in a special love relationship. Finally, there is nothing wrong with having preferences in this world, provided we don't take them seriously. We can say that one work of art is better than another, just as we can say that a particular musical composition is better than another, one method of education is better than another, one medical treatment is better than another, based on criteria we have set up in those fields. From the Course's point of view, they all are equally illusory. Yet, it is natural to evaluate things in a somewhat objective way in the world. The lesson, though, is not to take seriously any conclusions we reach about things in the world--we should do it with a gentle smile somewhere in our minds, because we know that it is all made up."

    "output": "In a sense, they are both. We begin with the decisions or choices we make on a physical level, because that is where we believe we are. However, as students who are now beginning Chapter 30, we are familiar enough with the Course material to know that ultimately Jesus is always talking to us about what occurs on the level of the mind; in other words, choosing between the content of love or fear, and not choosing among the many forms the world presents to us. The seven \"rules\" for decision are not to be taken literally, but are useful in remembering that the \"right\" decision making is a process. That is, learning we have a choice with whom we make decisions takes time and practice. And \"right\" decision making does not necessarily mean choosing Jesus or the Holy Spirit. What it does mean, is that we recognize we have a choice of choosing either of them, or choosing the ego. As egos, we really have no motivation to choose Jesus or the Holy Spirit, other than the Course telling us that we will feel better if we do. And that's not reason enough to get us to choose them consistently. What is reason enough is to continually make decisions based on the ego, and becoming aware of the cost of such decisions. Rejecting the Love of God can only lead to guilt, since it is the shadowy fragment of our original decision to reject God by choosing to be separate from his Love, and be on our own. It is this guilt that is the source of all of our pain and suffering. As the Course says, \"Of all the many causes you perceived as bringing pain and suffering to you, your guilt was not among them\" (T- 27.VII.7:4). Only when we link our pain with our decisions does choice become meaningful. And once we reach this point, the choice of whom to decide with becomes obvious: \"Who with the Love of God upholding him could find the choice of miracles or murder hard to make?\" (T- 23.IV.9:8)"

    "text_input": "Q #23: Can one be a student of A Course in Miracles and still be a part of a mainstream religion?",
    "output": "Yes, if it is helpful, for as the manual teaches us: \"The curriculum is highly individualized, and all aspects are under the Holy Spirit's particular care and guidance\" (M-29.2:6). No one has the right nor the wisdom to determine what would be a help to someone on a spiritual path. That is why the Course always emphasizes the importance of asking the Holy Spirit's help. That being said, however, it is true that on the level of their actual teachings, the Course differs markedly from mainstream religions. Indeed, we could say that one of the characteristics of A Course in Miracles is the contrast of its teachings with that of traditional Christianity. At this level, therefore, conflict would be inevitable at some point in one's study; for example, other Western religions do not teach that \"the world was made as an attack on God\" (W-pII.3.2:1), and that our real terror is of redemption and not of crucifixion (T-13.III.1:10-11). It could become quite tempting to harmonize both thought systems, a compromise that could only be detrimental to both paths. We are so filled with conflict as it is, that to intentionally build more into our daily lives seems an unloving act to ourselves. Taking an intellectual interest in mainstream religion for the purposes of comparing and contrasting such with the Course is one thing, but actually trying to live out both paths on a daily basis would be very difficult indeed. However, remembering the individualized nature of one's curriculum, participating in both the Course and mainstream religion is nonetheless possible. The question to ask oneself, therefore, would be: what is the purpose?"

    "text_input": "Q #24: A Course in Miracles seems to allude to reincarnation. If we truly don't die but instead just \"lay this body\" down, do we return in another or continue our lessons on another level?",
    "output": "Yes, in the Course, Jesus does seem to allude to reincarnation. But to understand what he is saying, and to address your question, we need to remember that in the Course, he is always speaking to us on the level of the mind, which is the only level where any true learning takes place. And specifically, he's talking to that part of our mind which has to choose between the ego and the Holy Spirit, between hate and love, between death and life. \"But remember that understanding is of the mind, and only of the mind\" (T-15.VI.7:5). He tells us in the Course that this \"life\" is a dream, that the world is an illusion, that the body doesn't die because the body doesn't live (T-19.IV-C.5:2-5), and that our experience of time is simply a part of that illusion. Our \"dream\" always and only reflects the choice that we have made for either the ego's purpose to reinforce our guilt and belief in separation, or the Holy Spirit's purpose of forgiveness and undoing the belief in separation. Therefore, the form of the dream never matters, and when that form changes, the learning, or choosing, continues in the mind. So when reading a passage that seems to imply reincarnation we could understand it not only on the level of our experience within the dream, but also as the idea of revisiting unforgivenesses. Perhaps it would be helpful to think of \"simultaneous\" dreams, or to use the model of a hologram where the whole is found in every part. When the mind \"revisits\" dreams or aspects of the hologram, this could be seen as experiencing different \"lifetimes.\" Jesus tells us in the manual that a belief in the concept of reincarnation is not a requirement for his Course. In fact, he says that it is only valuable to the extent to which it is \"helpful\" or of comfort to his students. \"In the ultimate sense, reincarnation is impossible. There is no past or future, and the idea of birth into a body has no meaning either once or many times. Reincarnation cannot, then, be true in any real sense\" (M-24.1:1-3). \"Reincarnation would not, under any circumstances, be the problem to be dealt with now. ... It is certain, however, that the way to salvation can be found by those who believe in reincarnation and by those who do not. The idea cannot, therefore, be regarded as essential to the curriculum. There is always some risk in seeing the present in terms of the past. There is always some good in any thought which strengthens the idea that life and the body are not the same\" (M-24.2:1,5- 8). When we can accept the fact that time is not linear, the concept of reincarnation becomes meaningless. But, as long as we believe we are separate individuals, the lessons continue in whatever form we can accept and understand until we truly learn that our reality is spirit and we have always been \"at home in God, [only] dreaming of exile\" (T-10.I.2:1). In that acceptance of the Atonement for ourselves, all dreaming ends."

I detect a sadness and/or fear, though, because of the void that is there when I let go of the specialness that wants to be maintained through material \"stuff\" or relationships, etc. What would you suggest to help one over the hump, or through the veil so one can see everyone with a healed perception? The void can seem wide and deep, hence fearful.",
    "output": "Trust is essential as you go through this. At one point Jesus pleads with us not to \"breathe life into your failing ego\" (T-17.V.8:4); and he reassures us that \"the death of specialness is not your death, but your awaking into life eternal\" (T-24.II.14:4). These, among many other passages, are helpful reminders when we are going through rough times that, first of all, Jesus knows what we are going through, and second that everything will wind up okay if we just continue to practice forgiveness. Most students go through what you have described. One person likened it to standing on a dock with one foot on the dock and the other on the edge of a boat that suddenly starts drifting away from the dock. Unpleasant, to put it mildly! Sometimes this experience reflects the well-known \"dark night of the soul\" spoken of in spiritual literature. This is discussed in the manual for teachers in the \"Development of Trust\" section, where Jesus describes the fifth stage as \"a period of unsettling\" (M-4.I.A.7:1). You are no longer firmly rooted in specialness but have not gotten beyond it entirely, because deep within your mind you know that to let go of specialness means letting go of your identity as a separate, independent individual. That is the underlying fear. If you simply acknowledge that and bring that fear to the love of Jesus in your mind, you will feel better. There is no way around this stage of the process, if you want to wind up in the \"right place.\" You never want to force yourself to give up a relationship or something in the world you still enjoy, nor do you want to force yourself to see everyone with a healed perception. If you really wanted to get beyond the perception of separate interests, you would be beyond it. Thus, being honest about your reluctance to let go of specialness is extremely helpful. You also can ask yourself what it would feel like to relate to others without specialness. Sometimes that reveals an element in yourself that you weren't aware of, a source of resistance that you didn't know was there. Finally, just be patient and trust the process."

    "text_input": "Q #26: Can you explain the holy instant in more detail?",
    "output": "As defined in our Glossary-Index for A Course in Miracles by Kenneth Wapnick, the holy instant is \"the instant outside time in which we choose forgiveness instead of guilt, the miracle instead of a grievance, the Holy Spirit instead of the ego; the expression of our little willingness to live in the present, which opens into eternity, rather than holding on to the past and fearing the future, which keeps us in hell ... \" It is important to understand that the holy instant is outside time and beyond the body: \"At no single instant does the body exist at all\" (T-18.VII.3:1). It is a term given to our experience of oneness with someone else that completely transcends anything of the body. There is no separation between you and this other person. The conflicting, separate interests that characterized the relationship before have completely dissolved in favor of the recognition that there are only shared interests. All sense of competition and comparison are simply non-existent in the holy instant, which is when you have deliberately chosen not to see your interests as apart from someone else's. There are many other ways in which this can occur, because there are so many ways in which we have expressed separation. It is a chosen instant in which our fear has abated enough for us to accept the truth about ourselves and everyone else. It seems to be a fleeting instant that comes and goes only because our fear is still too great to allow ourselves to make this our permanent state. When that happens we are in the real world. Thus the term is also used to denote the ultimate holy instant, the real world, the culmination of all the holy instants we have chosen along the way."

Was the Son not conscious of His relationship with God or unaware of Unity with God? This may sound dumb, but it's like saying are we aware that we are not aware or unaware that we are aware.",
    "output": "This question arises frequently, and is a natural one to ask, not a dumb one! The trouble is the question makes sense only to minds that cannot conceive of non-dualistic reality. And we have this difficulty because, briefly stated, we, as one Son, rejected oneness and substituted independent, individualized existence in place of our true reality. That puts us at a distinct disadvantage in trying to make sense out of all of the statements in the Course that speak of reality as non-dualistic, as pure oneness. Jesus must use language and concepts that we can understand--which is the language of dualism--to begin the process of getting us beyond duality. And he often reminds us that there is much that we cannot yet understand, but will eventually understand as our identification with the body diminishes. Therefore, to answer your question, before the Mind of God's Son seemed to split, i.e., before the separation seemed to happen, there was only a perfect unity between God and Christ: \"What He creates is not apart from Him, and nowhere does the Father end, the Son begin as something separate from Him\" (W-pI.132.12:4). The Course makes it clear that God created Christ, but this does not mean two beings in relation to each other, along the lines we are familiar with. Since it is a perfect unity, there cannot be consciousness. What this state without consciousness would be like is incomprehensible to us because of the present condition of our minds, and it is futile to speculate about it: \"...while you think that part of you is separate, the concept of a Oneness joined as One is meaningless\" (T-25.I.7:1). Similarly, in speaking about our function in Heaven of extending love as Christ, Jesus tells us that this also is meaningless to us, but what we can understand and practice is forgiveness: \"Therefore, you have a function in the world in its own terms. For who can understand a language far beyond his simple grasp? ... Creation cannot even be conceived of in the world. It has no meaning here. Forgiveness is the closest it can come to earth\" (W-pI.192.2:1-2; 3:1-3). So we wind up humbly silent, yet hopeful that if we do what Jesus asks of us in his Course, we shall one day have the experience that will end all questioning and wondering."

    "text_input": "Q #28: How do I forgive others for their horrible acts? How can I forgive the sniper? Is this not real? Is it the distraction of the ego? I also fear what is real. When I say, above all I want to see, I become terrified. I have a hard time giving up this world we created. I love some of my creations, like my family. Don't I need to die to return to my reality? Won't I be lonely?",
    "output": "The forgiveness the Course is teaching us is a process of looking at a situation such as the sniper killings and asking ourselves what this event is telling us about what we believe. We begin by looking honestly at our reactions to these killings which include all kinds of feelings and judgments about the victims and the victimizers. All these feelings and thoughts are useful in uncovering the hidden beliefs of the ego thought system; that the world is real, that we are bodies, that what we call death is the end of what we call \"life,\" that we are vulnerable to attack ...the list goes on and on. The Course then asks us to recognize that all these are feelings and thoughts about ourselves that we have projected on to the victims as well as the victimizers. We are learning that the feelings/thoughts along with the pain they cause were already with us before the event took place. The event only seemed to cause the feelings. This is why the Course says we forgive our brothers for what they did not do. \"Be willing to forgive the Son of God for what he did not do\" (T-17.III.1,5). The snipers did not cause our feelings, our mistaken beliefs did. If we are willing to look at any situation in this way we are beginning to question the ego's lies. We are then in a position to ask for another way of seeing. This is sometimes very difficult to do; it takes practice and a lot of honesty, but it is the only way we can get in touch with the beliefs that are keeping us rooted in a thought system that is causing us a lot of pain. This pain is coming from believing the ego's lies and not from the situation, in this case the killings. It is very important that we practice this without denying any of the feelings or thoughts we do have about the outrageous events in this ego world of fear and hatred and without forcing ourselves to try to accept a new belief system that challenges our usual ego perspective. This will only entrench us in our mistaken views and make us more afraid. If we are willing to just say \"maybe I'm wrong about this\", then the world we've made and all our relationships, including those we \"love,\" become our classroom for learning the Holy Spirit's interpretation of everything we experience rather than serving as a distraction. (Note: the Course uses the term made for the ego's world. Creation refers to God's extension of Love on the level of the Mind only.) The Course tells us the Holy Spirit will not take any of our special relationships away from us but will instead give us a different interpretation and a different purpose for them. Without them we would not be aware of the mistaken beliefs about ourselves or the judgments (whether for good or for bad) that keep us in our deep sleep. We have made ourselves afraid of what is real and that is why we have a Teacher who is inviting us to take small steps with Him toward a new way of thinking. If we do this with Jesus or the Holy Spirit by our side we will not be lonely or dead. Eventually we will fully waken from the dream with the realization that we were in fact only dreaming, with no thought or need for dying. Meanwhile each step in forgiveness brings us more peace and takes us closer to the truth where our family will include everyone and we will not experience any sense of loss."

    "text_input": "Q #29: When Jesus turned over the table in the Temple, it seemed to reinforce the ego thought system. He was angry, and ultimately was punished by being crucified. I keep repeating in my mind, there must be a different way of looking at this, to speed up the healing I submitted this question to the Foundation.",
    "output": "In Forgiveness and Jesus: The Meeting Place of A Course in Miracles and Christianity and A Talk Given on A Course in Miracles: An Introduction (by Kenneth Wapnick, published by the Foundation for A Course in Miracles), this gospel passage is discussed at length. The full explanation presented in these books is summarized here. As you may know the Gospel accounts of Jesus' sayings and actions are not necessarily historical fact. It is likely that the incident in the Temple did not happen in the way that it is depicted in the Gospel. This view is accepted even by many Christian Scripture scholars. It is also important to note that the Gospel account does not say that Jesus was angry, although in the movies of Jesus' life he has been portrayed as angry. If something of this nature did occur in which Jesus appears to be angry, without truly feeling any anger, he would have been using this outburst as a teaching tool to make a point for the large crowd of people present in the Temple at the time of the Passover. In this case the point would have been that the \"chosen people\" had distorted the Old Testament teaching by using the Temple for purposes other than as a \"house of prayer.\" This is close to the traditional interpretation of this incident by Christian scholars. As a good teacher Jesus acted in a dramatic way to more effectively draw attention to his message. One could also consider a final option; that Jesus was actually angry, having an \"ego attack.\" If this were the case there are at least three conditions that would have to be present; Jesus would not be at peace, God would not be in his awareness, he would perceive the money lenders as his enemy. It is inconceivable that Jesus, whose message and presence were filled only with love and peace, would have \"lost it\" in this way. It is also possible to believe that Jesus did have an ego attack, but if one chose to believe that, why would one then choose to identify with his ego, rather than with the love and forgiveness he teaches us in A Course in Miracles? Moreover, even if it were possible for Jesus to have such an ego attack, the Course tells us he would certainly not be punished for his \"sin\" by being crucified. \"There is no sin\" (T-26.VII.10:5). The central teaching of the Course is that God's Son is innocent: \"You are still My holy Son, forever innocent, forever loving and forever loved, as limitless as your Creator, and completely changeless and forever pure\" (W-pII.10.5:1). Since there is no sin there can be no punishment. The Course's teaching on the crucifixion, therefore, is from a very different perspective. In Jesus' words \"The crucifixion is nothing more than an extreme example\" (T-6.I.2:1), much like the example of the Temple incident, if it did in fact occur. Jesus says later: \"The message the crucifixion was intended to teach was that it is not necessary to perceive any form of assault in persecution, because you cannot be persecuted. If you respond with anger, you must be equating yourself with the destructible, and are therefore regarding yourself insanely\" (T-6.I.4:6-7). Jesus would not regard himself insanely, and since he knew he was not a body he remained at peace during the crucifixion, fully aware that nothing was happening. As we learn our true Identity as God's innocent Son, we also learn that we too can be at peace in the midst of seeming persecution. We, like Jesus, cannot be harmed in any way. This true Identity is not to be confused with the ego identities we choose as bodies which do die. Since there is no real life here in the body, there is also no real death. This is what Jesus knew when his body was crucified. This is what he is teaching us."

    "text_input": "Q #30: I play computer games, which I really like to do. I believe I have to quit playing these games one day, because I want the Holy Spirit's alternative. There is another distraction I cherish, which is even an addiction. The addiction pulls me completely out of right-mindedness; it is a kick, a thrill, but with many side effects, disadvantages, the burden of anticipation, etc. When I really look at it with Jesus, I do not want it anymore. And this is still not what I choose (up until now). There is an unwillingness to let go of these things. That they conflict with the Course ... [Jesus] went shoe shopping with Helen for awhile, but then also advised her to let it go.",
    "output": "Keep in mind that this is a process, and that it takes a long time for most of us. Patience and gentleness with ourselves are key parts of this process; otherwise, we fall into the ego's trap of making the error real. An important piece of advice Jesus gives us at the beginning of the \"Rules for Decision\" is: \"Do not fight yourself\" (T-30.I.1:7). Therefore, the most helpful approach would be to simply look at your reluctance to accept the Holy Spirit's alternative, and your feeling that Jesus' love is not enough for you, and then not condemn yourself for feeling that way. Just continue to be honest with yourself and with Jesus about how much you do not want to believe and accept what this Course is teaching you, and then don't judge yourself for it. You will be practicing the Course in a very effective way if you can do this. That is what forgiveness is all about. You will be learning that the \"sin\" you have accused yourself of has had no effect, and that it was only a \"tiny, mad idea\" that has not changed love in any way. Jesus is always and only interested in purpose. Thus, Helen was ready to change the purpose of her shopping sprees. She no longer needed to \"protect\" herself from Jesus' love; therefore, she did not need to go shopping anymore. When our fear of accepting Jesus' love lessens, our involvement in our defenses against accepting that love will lessen as well. While the specific activities may still be a part of our lives, their purpose will have changed entirely. It is always content, not form. The experience of peace or conflict has nothing to do with the activity or object itself. Peace and conflict are the result of our having chosen our ego or Jesus as our teacher. Finally, speaking in general with regard to addictions: It often is necessary to deal with the behavior first--to take whatever steps can be taken to curtail or stop the destructive behavior. This would reflect the mind's decision to be more loving towards oneself and others. Then, when the behavior is more under control, the person can begin to deal with the cause of the addiction in the mind. Addictions most often are rooted in overwhelming self-hatred and guilt, which then gets projected onto one's own and/or another's body."

    "text_input": "Q #31: Please explain how one is to interpret sin. What is it? Does it exist or not? Can one substitute the words \"lack of love\" when reading the text? Thank you",
    "output": "If you were to ask the ego to interpret sin, its meaning would be death (T-19.IV-A.17:3), while the Holy Spirit's meaning would be that it is a mistake to be corrected (e.g., T-19.II-III). The Course teaches us that to the ego sin is the death of God, or better yet the murder of God, and we are the murderers. Therefore, separation is a symbol of God's death. We are reminded of our sin daily, whenever we see ourselves and others as separate, which is the only way we can see because the ego made the body to \"see\" this way. However, our attitude can yet be one of unity, even though our bodies' eyes still see separation. This is one way the Holy Spirit can use what the ego made to serve another purpose (T-28.I.2:8). Practically speaking, if we are identified with the ego, we interpret sin to be whatever takes away our peace, and the sinners we perceive outside ourselves are those who take it. No matter how big or small the situation, anything which \"robs\" us of our peace is called sin. It may even be ourselves who take away our own peace, but inevitably someone else made us this way, so we are once again made sinless. As to whether sin exists or not, the Course teaches us that the separation never happened (M- 2.2:6,8). And since separation is the entire foundation of the ego's meaning of sin, then indeed it does not exist. Finally, substituting \"lack of love\" will not necessarily have the same impact on a student as \"sin.\" We all have conscious and unconscious beliefs around the word \"sin,\" and by substituting other words for it, we deny ourselves the opportunity of forgiving all the associations we have made. \"Lack of love\" as a substitute makes it sound as if we are \"lacking in love,\" something which, of course, would not be our fault. Words such as \"withholding,\" or \"selfish,\" would be more in tune with what we really believe sin means."

    "text_input": "Q #32: I have read that Freud said the point of psychoanalysis is to make the unconscious conscious. I know that the Course is based in some ways on concepts of Freudian theory, but  doesn't the Course say that all consciousness is inherently illusory? Doesn't this clash, then, with the main objective of psychoanalysis? Or am I having a case of level confusion?",
    "output": "The Course does indeed identify consciousness with what is illusory, describing it early in the text as \"the level of perception, the first split introduced into the mind after the separation, making the mind a perceiver rather than a creator. Consciousness is correctly identified as the domain of the ego\" (T-3.IV.2:1-2). But like all things the ego has made to support and maintain the belief in separation, the Holy Spirit can give it a different purpose. And so later, Jesus observes that \"consciousness has levels and awareness can shift quite dramatically, but it cannot transcend the perceptual realm. At its highest it becomes aware of the real world, and can be trained to do so increasingly\" (C-1.7:4-5). So yes, although consciousness metaphysically speaking is part of the illusion and so is not real, since we believe in its reality and experience it as an inherent part of ourselves, the Course provides us a way to use our consciousness in order ultimately to transcend it. The process of being trained to attain the real world is really a matter of making conscious what our ego has made unconscious through fear, so that the false perceptions of the ego can be healed and replaced by the true perception of the Holy Spirit, preparing us for our return to knowledge (the Course's term for Heaven), beyond all consciousness and perception. We have made the split mind--where consciousness resides--unconscious, and instead believe that consciousness is an epiphenomenon of the body or, more specifically, of the brain. We have also made unconscious all the guilt in the mind that we have concocted as a defense of consciousness, projecting the guilt out into a world of form where we would never suspect its origin. So all of the ego's defenses must be made conscious--or as the Course more eloquently describes it, we must be \"willing to bring the darkness to light\" (T-18.III.6:2)--so that their unreality can be recognized. And so we use the consciousness of the split mind to do this until, in the end, all of our false perceptions have been made conscious and healed, and consciousness is no longer needed. At that point, we are ready to leave the realm of consciousness and perception and \"disappear into the Presence beyond the veil...not to be seen [perceived] but known\" (T- 19.IV-D.19:1)."

    "text_input": "Q #33: When I am \"stuck\" and don't feel I am being completely willing to let go of a well- established defense, I very often ask Jesus to help me with my unwillingness in the situation. I have experienced what I believe is success with this tool from time to time. I must also say that it doesn't always work--I still feel the discomfort and unhappiness of retaining the grievance even though I've asked Him to help me with my unwillingness. Is this some kind of sophisticated ego ploy?",
    "output": "Being totally honest with Jesus about your unwillingness to let go of a grievance is helpful in itself, especially since you are experiencing the effects of not letting it go. This stubbornness does not make you sinful and does not affect Jesus' love for you. So feeling like a failure, or any form of self-condemnation would be the only mistake at that point--you already are aware of the price you are paying to hold on to the grievance. You can just stop with that, acknowledging that forgiveness as A Course in Miracles teaches is a process, and that when the underlying fear lessens, you will take another step. If you really wanted to forgive, you would. You might ask yourself what you would feel like, or what would happen, if you really did totally let go of the grievance. That might disclose the nature of the fear behind your unwillingness. Then you and Jesus could deal with that together. That would help to keep you honest, too. There is no way of ever being totally sure whether you are listening to the ego or the Holy Spirit. After many years of experience, you become more familiar with your favorite means of self- deception, but usually you need someone who knows you well to help you discern. It's a difficulty most students experience, because of the tremendous fear we all have of returning home to God."

    "text_input": "Q #34: From what I understand, anyone who reaches or experiences the state of the real world would not need or do anything external. Still, is it possible to \"create\" something artistic in this world (like a piece of music, a poem, etc.) out of pure need to share the state of happiness?",
    "output": "Being in the real world means that you know that you are not a body and that the physical world is not real. You know that your identity--as well as everyone else's--has nothing to do with either the body or the world. It is a state of mind in which the ego thought system is no longer present and therefore there is no decision-making aspect, because there no longer are two thought systems to choose between. The content of the mind is purely the Holy Spirit's thought system of love. Consequently, in this state of mind there would be no I that would experience a need to do something. It is not that your body would not do anything, but that \"you\" would not be the agent of the \"doing.\" The Holy Spirit's love would flow through you, and so your experience would be that \"you\" are not doing anything. Remember, our journey into \"the far country\" has been a journey away from the state of oneness and into a state of physical individuality. Therefore our journey back is a journey toward selflessness, characterized by our re-acceptance of the truth that God's Son is one and invulnerable. Just before the dream of separation disappears totally, we would reach the state of knowing once and for all that bodies and the world are totally unreal. They are nothing other than the dreams of a mind that has fallen asleep, and therefore nothing happening in the dreams truly matters. It matters only to the figures in the dream. But a healed mind would know that even the dream itself never really happened. If that is your state of mind, how then could there be any need to be creative? The love of the Holy Spirit would extend through you to those who still think they are separate from that love, and in some way are calling out for it. But you would not direct that process. There no longer is that kind of a \"you.\" If the artist's experience is \"I am profoundly happy. I want others who are not happy to share what I am experiencing,\" chances are that that is coming from the ego, because there is separation in the perception. If you experience a need to share love, you are making the error real. If the artistic impulse is coming from the Holy Spirit or from Jesus, there would be no sense of urgency, and the artist would not experience himself or herself as the agent of the work produced, nor would there be any concern over whether and how it is received. Love naturally extends of itself, and that extension of love might be expressed through art in some form, but that is far different from \"creating,\" as you stated, \"something artistic in this world ... out of pure need to share the state of happiness.\" That could well be the ego sneaking in the back door to retrieve part of its self-importance that was starting to slip away."

    "text_input": "Q #35: It seems the more I study A Course in Miracles, I begin to think I am going backward instead of forward. My mind is more noisy than ever. Why is that?",
    "output": "The Course has a helpful perspective on this: \"Put yourself not in charge of this [wakening to knowledge], for you cannot distinguish between advance and retreat. Some of your greatest advances you have judged as failures, and some of your deepest retreats you have evaluated as success\" (T-18.V.1:5-6). The fact is we really do not know where we are in our progress; we do not even know if we are going backwards or forwards. It is important to remember this in our study of the Course so as not to waste a lot of time and effort judging or evaluating ourselves. Most likely the \"noise\" in your mind that seems to be more than ever was there before your study of the Course; the difference is now you are aware of it. Now you know you have a mind and that it is a noisy mind, and that is exactly what the Course is helping us to learn. We begin our practice by learning not to deny that we are using our noise to drown out the \"still small Voice\" (T-21.V.1:6) of the Holy Spirit. Since denial is part of our defense strategy as egos, beginning to hear our noisy minds is the beginning of undoing denial. As we deepen our commitment to study the Course, our noise may actually seem to get louder because of our resistance. Our ego identity feels threatened by what we are learning and puts up a fight in a variety of ways, one of them being a noisy mind. This is also a ploy of the ego to convince us to stop our pursuit of the truth, because it tells us we are \"getting worse.\" Our task is to begin to pay attention to the chatter in our minds because it is telling us what we believe. The whole point of the mind training of the Course is to uncover the thoughts, judgments, beliefs and lies hidden in our minds causing us to feel guilty and fearful. The good news is that \"The still, small Voice for God is not drowned out by all the ego's raucous screams and senseless ravings to those who want to hear It\" (T-21.V.1:6). We will hear His promptings when we have heard and forgiven all of our objections."

    "output": "Angels are part of the illusion, whether we speak of them in the usual sense as ethereal bodies or as they are spoken of in the Course. In the Course's teaching, reality refers only to the Oneness of God and His Son in Heaven, where there is only Unity and no distinction between Father and His one Son. There is no plural in this reality. According to the Course, everything else is part of the illusion of the dream. The Course speaks of angels as metaphor and symbol. They are symbols for the reflection of God's thoughts, which are always with us. It is a loving, poetic use of a term that is familiar to us to teach us about the Love God extends to the Sonship, since we may still be too fearful to have a direct experience of His Love. We generally understand angels to be benign spirits who are comforting and helpful to us. In the Course, Jesus uses this form because we have this positive association, and he is helping us to gently let go of our fear in terms we are able to understand. You may notice that wherever angels are mentioned in the Course the language is beautiful poetry, with terms that are comforting and uplifting. These are words of encouragement that reflect the truth of God's Love for us."

    "text_input": "Q #37: This question is an edited combination of two separate questions that were submitted on the theme of choice and predetermination or destiny in A Course in Miracles:  As I understand it, in this dream of separation my only real choice is which teacher I choose in every situation I find myself: the ego or the Holy Spirit. As for the dream itself, we are told that the script is already written. But I wonder, can I, as the dreamer of the dream, change the dream in terms of the specific events that unfold. Or can I change the dream only in terms of my perspective on the situation? In other words, is everything that I'm experiencing predestined when it comes to situations and relationships, etc.? That would mean that I'm walking through an old dream of separation, like watching an old movie, that my marriage could never have lasted longer than it did, I could never have had more than the number of children I have now, and the relationship I'm in now is already fully defined in terms of time, etc. As I'm given the opportunity to 'save time' by choosing the Holy Spirit as my teacher, it would mean only that I'm allowed to skip certain parts of the story. Is it like this?  But it also seems that the Course encourages us not to exchange an unholy relationship for yet another unholy relationship with someone else, as we search for happiness we will never find outside of ourselves, but instead to make the relationship we are in a holy one. This seems to indicate that we do have choices in terms of the story, the people we're meeting, etc. So then there could be several possible versions of my lifetime. One might include two or more briefer marriages with different spouses while another might involve remaining in the same marriage for many years. But Jesus says that nothing is left to coincidence and that every meeting is planned. Or does the form simply not matter and do I just see shadows, projecting my own images on them? But then why is it that the script of my life, if it is already determined, seems to have such a significant effect on other people's lives?  Jesus also says that what we see is the judgment we first passed on ourselves, and outside of that there is no world. Does that mean that, for example, if there is a war between the United States and Iraq, I could have done something to stop it? Did it already happen and was it corrected, so that if I'm seeing a war instead of peace, does that mean that my mind still needs to be corrected because I am still choosing the wrong teacher? Or could I have done nothing to avoid the war and do I just choose which teacher with whom to view the events? And would I see nothing but innocence on both sides if I choose the Holy Spirit?",
    "output": "To address completely all the questions and issues you've raised could take a book (and there is a book, A Vast Illusion: Time According to A Course in Miracles by Kenneth Wapnick, which you may find helpful to amplify some of the points that we'll address briefly here). The Course does say that our only real choice is between the ego and Holy Spirit, the emphasis being on \"real.\" But within the dream, there are nearly an infinite number--although not infinite, only nearly infinite, because the ego can not make anything that is either infinite or eternal (T- 4.I.11:7)--of alternatives we can choose among at the level of form. But their underlying content is all the same--sin, guilt and fear--and so the Course emphasizes that there is no real choice among alternatives that are really all the same. Meaningful choice can be made only on the level of content and so the only real choice is between the guilt and fear of the ego and the forgiveness and love of the Holy Spirit. So, yes, there are many different forms or sequences of events that our lives may take as a result of our seeming choices, but so long as we are choosing with the ego, believing that happiness can be found outside ourselves, nothing will really change, although our circumstances and relationships may alter significantly. By the way, the Course does not actually encourage us to remain physically in a relationship in order to make it holy--it never advises us on the level of specifics or form. When it cautions us about \"getting rid of your brother\" (T-17.V.7:2), it is speaking of how we are perceiving our brother in our mind, including in particular all of the special fantasies we have associated with him that are no longer being fulfilled. Now the Course also says, as you remark, that the script is already written (W-pI.158.4:3) and that everything in time has already happened, so that our lives are nothing more than seeing \"the journey from the point at which it ended, looking back on it, imagining we make it once again; reviewing mentally what has gone by\" (4:5). And while Jesus says that nothing happens by chance, he is clearly attributing the responsibility for choice for all the experiences of our lives to our own mind (T-21.II.3:1-3). But this does not mean that everything in our lives is predetermined, that the sequence of events is fixed. We are always choosing from an array of many possible events that have all already occurred, but the unique sequencing and the vast number of past events we're choosing from, combined with our repressing any memory of any of them and our belief that time itself is both real and linear, add to the feeling that it is all new. And this is all part of the ego defense to mislead us into believing something new and meaningful is happening in our lives, reinforcing the foolish hope that somehow this time our ego choice in the world of form will have a better outcome. To understand the seeming effect of our lives on each other, we need to step back and look from outside the dream of the world, and return our attention to the mind where all choices are really being made. The nearly infinite number of possible events in time was written in one instant by the one (collective) mind, joined with the ego, before the fragmentary projection out into the world of separate individuals and lives seemed to happen. As Jesus explains, \"time lasted but an instant in your mind, with no effect upon eternity. And so is all time past ... The tiny tick of time in which the first mistake was made, and all of them within that one mistake ... \" (T- 26.V.3:3-5, italics added). Now my individual dream is separate and can not truly be shared with anyone else. But since all minds are joined, any decision that I make to interact as a body with you, or that you make to interact as a body with me, must always reflect an agreement we both have made together, at the level of mind outside of time and space, to replay certain events in time and space that have already happened. And this joint agreement must be kept buried in our unconscious if it is to be effective in supporting the ego's purpose of separation and victimization. Jesus speaks of this joint decision, specifically in the context of our agreement to be hurt by each other, as \"the secret vow that you have made with every brother who would walk apart ... Unstated and unheard in consciousness ... it is a promise to another to be hurt by him, and to attack him in return ... so that [the body] will suffer pain. It is the obvious effect of what was made in secret, in agreement with another's secret wish to be apart from you, as you would be apart from him. Unless you both agree that is your wish, it can have no effects\" (T-28.VI.4:3,6-7; 5:1-3). This hidden joint agreement to seem to be affected by each other must be the case, for otherwise we would be the victim of each other's decisions. While this joint agreement about form is true at a metaphysical level, at a practical level it is much more helpful to focus on the fact that in the world, as the physical self with which I identify, I am not able to control what others do, but I nevertheless always have a choice about how I will perceive what is happening in my life. I can decide which teacher I will invite in, and whether I will see my peace of mind as dependent only on my own choice--as the Holy Spirit would teach--or whether I choose to see others as having power to take away my peace of mind--accepting the ego's teaching that I can be victimized and therefore am not responsible for how I feel. As to whether or not a healed mind sees war and has any choice about it, it is apparent that Jesus recognizes the conflicts of our ego--he spends a great deal of the Course pointing out the ego's sick dynamics to us--but that does not mean his mind is not healed. What is important is that he is not judging us as he uncovers our ego's machinations. He sees everything as either an extension of love or a call for it (T-12.I.3:1-4). When we are joined with Jesus in our minds, we will see any conflict in the world, at either an individual or an international level, in that same light. We will not deny what our eyes see, but our interpretation will be different from the world's interpretation. In the context of sickness, the Course observes that \"the body's eyes will continue to see differences. But the mind that has let itself be healed will no longer acknowledge them. There will be those who seem to be 'sicker' than others, and the body's eyes will report their changed appearances as before. But the healed mind will put them all in one category; they are unreal\" (M-8.6:1-4). And this healed perception can arise only after our mind has released its belief in the value of conflict and war as a means for projecting the guilt of separation outside of our own mind. We may have agreed to participate in a collective dream where an external war is played out in order to reinforce the ego's perception of the world as one of victims and victimizers, but we can in any instant ask for help, first recognizing the ego's purpose for war and then deciding we no longer wish to reinforce that insanity in our own mind. And before we would see innocence on all sides of the conflict, we would first see the insanity on all sides, and recognize it is the same insanity we share with everyone else when we are identified with the ego."

    "text_input": "Q #38: What is the Course referring to when it says: \"There will be no assault upon your wish to hear a call that never has been made\" (T-31.II.8:5)?",
    "output": "The \"call that never has been made\" refers to the \"call\" to be separate from God, heard constantly in our wrong minds. It is impossible to separate from totality, from everything; therefore, the call \"never was made.\" That is another way of stating the Atonement principle that the separation never happened in reality. And we will not be punished for wishing to hear the call that tells us that our individual, separate identity is real. In a different context, Jesus says basically the same thing: \"Here is your promise never to allow union to call you out of separation ... \" (T-19.IV-D.3:4). But he never tires of reminding us that it is not a sin deserving of retribution to prefer to exist as an individual being and make up a God in our own image rather than answer the call of the Holy Spirit to return to our true Identity as spirit, as Christ. This is what is meant by: \"There will be no assault ... \" It corrects the traditional biblical views that an offended, vengeful God demands atonement through sacrifice for the sins of His children."

I then remember you say that whatever needs to be done here would be done because my body would then be directed in the most helpful way, but that it wouldn't be my concern any more. In fact, if it were my concern, it would be my ego doing it. Is that right? How do I reconcile that with the example of bodhisattvas who choose to maintain an attachment to something in this world, be it a loved one or chocolate, in order to maintain the body and do the work of helping that they came here to do? That is an investment in what we do from the point of view of the Course, isn't it?",
    "output": "If I understand you correctly, you are saying that you believe you are here and would like to go home, but you haven't made that choice yet because you feel you are not finished here. That state of mind is distinctly different from the state of a mind that is healed, knows that it is not really here, but has become solely the instrument of the Holy Spirit's Love. The starting points, in other words, are very different. The healed mind has already \"left,\" you might say, and is \"here\" in a totally different way from the mind that is still on the journey and considering the choice to go home with Jesus. A healed mind is beyond any bodily identity and thoroughly identified with non-dualistic love. To be present in an illusory state, therefore, requires a focus on something to help ground it. It could be anything at all--from a love of chocolate to following a certain baseball team. But there would never be a reluctance or resistance to returning home, because the healed mind knows it is already there; there is nothing to attain, no journey. I believe you are expressing something entirely different in content from this state of mind. In form, both might experience that they are not yet finished with what they are here to do. But for those still on the journey and learning how to lessen their investment in their bodily identity, there would be tremendous fear to let go totally of the only identity with which they are familiar. It is a gradual process over many, many years requiring the commitment to look fearlessly with Jesus at the contents of their wrong minds, which rest almost immutably on the defiant choice to leave Home and never return. As Jesus poignantly reassures us: \"I am leading you to a new kind of experience that you will become less and less willing to deny\" (T-11.VI.3:6). It is a process, and the final choice will be made effortlessly. In fact, the attraction to Love will be so strong that it will not even be regarded as a choice. There no longer is a concern about going \"poof\"!"

I find this claim to be very dangerous. Are these claims true or are they nothing more than a form of seeking salvation through separation and a desire to create a level of specialness within a certain demographic namely those educated enough to understand, comprehend, live the Course? How do we reconcile these claims with the text statement: All are called?",
    "output": "Anyone at all can benefit from the Course. One does not have to be an intellectual to learn from it and use it as a spiritual path. Nonetheless, it is obvious that it is written on a high intellectual level with sophisticated metaphysical, theological, and psychological concepts integrated into the teaching throughout the three books. Much of it is written in blank verse. Thus, a reader/ student who is not intellectually inclined and has no background in these areas would have difficulty understanding a great deal of the material. This does not mean, though, that such a person could not be helped by reading through it and doing the exercises in the workbook. If the person comes away from the Course being more kind, more loving, and reassured of God's Love, and less angry, depressed, and fearful, then its purpose has been fulfilled. On the other hand, there have been many highly educated people who were not able relate to the Course at all, for a variety of reasons. They will find another path more suitable to their needs and inclinations. Thus, to say that the Course is not for everyone is not to say that it deliberately excludes people. The Course says of itself that it is only one among many thousands of other forms of the universal course (M-1.4). It does not have to be for everyone. Some religions have claimed that theirs is the only true religion, the only way to be reconciled with God. A Course in Miracles does not do that. Rather, the implication throughout the Course is that everyone will eventually find a path that will lead them to God. It does not have to be this one."

    "text_input": "Q #41: The events, activities, and relationships of our \"waking dream\" comprise our classroom and are the vehicles for learning our lesson of forgiveness. Is there any particular significance or value of our \"sleeping dreams\" in the process of learning forgiveness and should our response to these images be any different from our response to our \"waking dream\" classroom?",
    "output": "It is the same mind that is dreaming both our waking and sleeping dreams. And it is one of the ego's many tricks to try to convince us that there is a real difference between the two so that we believe we are awake when we are really still asleep, just having a different form of the same dream of separation. One of the more important insights our sleeping dreams offer us upon our shifting to a seeming waking state is the realization that our mind has the power to make up a world in dreams that seems very real while we are experiencing it, a world made up solely to meet our own personal needs. Jesus elaborates on this aspect of our sleeping dreams in a very clear passage: \"Does not a world that seems quite real arise in dreams? ... And while you see it you do not doubt that it is real. Yet here is a world, clearly within your mind, that seems to be outside. You do not respond to it as though you made it, nor do you realize that the emotions the dream produces must come from you ... You seem to waken, and the dream is gone. Yet what you fail to recognize is that what caused the dream has not gone with it. Your wish to make another world that is not real remains with you. And what you seem to waken to is but another form of this same world you see in dreams. All your time is spent in dreaming. Your sleeping and your waking dreams have different forms, and that is all. Their content is the same. They are your protest against reality, and your fixed and insane idea that you can change it\" (T-18.II.1:1; 5:2- 4,8-15). In our sleeping dreams, we have the same choice of teachers that we have when we are \"awake\" and we may find over time that we can choose forgiveness while we sleep, recognizing that our judgments within the dream are not justified. We may even become a lucid dreamer, becoming aware, even as we are dreaming, that our sleeping dream is an invention of our own mind, presaging the awareness that will eventually come to us about our waking dreams. And our sleeping dreams also afford us the opportunity to understand the real meaning of forgiveness that Jesus is attempting to lead us towards, when we realize, upon awakening, that the source of any upset we experience in our sleeping dreams has nothing to do with what anyone else is doing to us. Our upset reflects nothing more than a decision in our own mind to be upset and then to attribute that loss of peace to a cause that seems to be outside of ourselves. The awareness that this is what we are also doing in our waking dreams is the foundation for the process of forgiveness as Jesus presents it to us in the Course: \"I am never upset for the reason I think .\" \" I am upset because I see something that is not there.\" (W-pI.5,6). \"Forgiveness recognizes what you thought your brother did to you has not occurred\" (W-pII.1.1:1). When we can generalize this recognition from our sleeping dreams to our waking dreams, we will be well on the way to awakening from all of our dreams of separation."

    "text_input": "Q #42: Does A Course in Miracles refer to \"God\" as an interactive God who makes changes and alterations to our physical and worldly existence in relation to our daily actions? The Course initially states that we are changeless but later refers to all the various changes which we make as we progress. I do not understand if we are capable of making any changes or not. If we are changeless, why bother doing anything at all because we are what we are anyway?",
    "output": "Although much of the Course refers to God in personal terms, as if He were a concerned Father, distinct from His children, Who is watching over us, when we understand the basic metaphysical teachings of the Course on God, it becomes apparent that these kinds of personal, human references to God can not be meant literally. They represent the Course's attempt to \"use the language that this [finite] mind can understand, in the condition [of separation] in which it thinks it is\" (T-25.I.7:4) and to correct the misperceptions we hold of God from our ego interpretation of God as an angry, vengeful Father who seeks to punish us for our attacks on Him. The Course spends very little time on the impossible task of describing to our limited, finite minds the true nature of God, His creations, and reality--\"there is no symbol for totality\" (T- 27.III.5:1)--but there are a few attempts. For example, from the workbook, \"What He creates is not apart from Him, and nowhere does the Father end, the Son begin as something separate from Him\" (W-pI.132.12:4). And acknowledging the impossibility of capturing in words that which is beyond all concepts and symbols: \"Oneness is simply the idea God is. And in His Being, He encompasses all things. No mind holds anything but Him. We say 'God is,' and then we cease to speak, for in that knowledge words are meaningless. There are no lips to speak them, and no part of mind sufficiently distinct to feel it is now aware of something not itself. It has united with its Source. And like its Source Itself, it merely is\" (W-pI.169.5). So God, Who is \"All in all\" (T-7.IV.7:4), cannot act on a part of Himself, as if it were separate from Him. And even to refer to Him as \"Him\" is to attribute a personal nature to the Source of all that in reality is totally abstract. The Course therefore does not describe God as interacting with His children in the world. That role is given to the Holy Spirit as the Voice for God, providing the Holy Spirit a symbolic function, unlike the Father and the Son (T-5.I.4:1). But since the world is all a projection of the basic ego illusion, which has no reality, there really is no world in which the Holy Spirit intervenes, only a mind that believes there is a world. And even then the Voice for God has no active function in the mind--\"It merely reminds\" (T-5.II.7:4) us of the truth about ourselves and God, which has never changed. The Course also refers to God as \"the Changeless\" (W-pI.112.2:2), and \"Formlessness\" (W- pI.186.14:1), Who creates \"only the changeless\" (T-6.IV.12:4). Consequently, it is inconceivable that He could be involved in making changes and alterations in a world of form. And that brings us to the second question you raise about our changelessness. In our reality as spirit, nothing has changed and we remain sinless, perfect and at one with our Source--this is the principle of the Atonement, repeated numerous times throughout the Course. It is in this sense that we are truly changeless. But clearly this is not what we believe or experience about ourselves. And so the Course does not simply assert what is real and true and leave it at that. That would not be of any help to us, trapped as we seem to be in the morass of our mistaken beliefs. So the Course accepts us where we think we are, acknowledging that we believe that we are each a separate physical being, living as a body in a world of time and space, struggling against forces that seem to be beyond our control. And it offers us the means--forgiveness, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit--to find the way out of this meaningless, senseless maze of beliefs in which we have imprisoned ourselves (T-26.V.4:1). Not because any of it is real, but only because we believe it is. And so long as we believe we have changed ourselves from our true reality as Christ, we will need to move through a seeming process of change that undoes all the changes we believe we have introduced into our identity, until we at last realize that in reality nothing has changed at all and we are back at home in the Heaven we never left, where we have always been. So this is a process of undoing, and not really doing at all. And any change we may seem to experience in the process of undoing our mistaken beliefs is as illusory as the initial thought of change that seemed to expel us from Heaven. But while we hold on to the belief that change is both possible and real, then change will be our experience. And our only choice will be whether to seek for change that reinforces guilt and separation and seems to take us even farther from our true home, or change that results from the practice of forgiveness in the context of our worldly relationships, allowing us to return."

    "text_input": "Q #43: How can you tell for certain that you are following the Voice of the Holy Spirit rather than the ego's voice? I know the Course says that we will feel peace when following the Holy Spirit but in practice I don't find it that simple. For one thing, I am often so filled with fear that I can't let go enough to feel the Spirit's peace. For another thing, my ego is quite capable of conjuring up such good facsimiles of the Holy Spirit's peace so that sometimes I feel I am following the Spirit, only to find myself badly mistaken. There are many examples today and throughout history of adherents of spiritual paths, committing fear and hate-based acts, all the while believing they are following the will of God, or the Voice of the Spirit. Course students are not immune to that mistake. Until we develop to the point where are can reliably tell which voice  we are following, isn't it better to have some sort of outside framework, such as rules against killing, violence etc., by which we can judge our guidance?",
    "output": "In our experience, this is the second most commonly asked question, the first being, \"How could the separation have happened in the first place?\" Your question is everyone's question who practices the Course. We have addressed it in our book The Most Commonly Asked Questions about \"A Course in Miracles,\" question 43, in which we comment on the section in Chapter 14 of the text, \"The Test of Truth.\" In general it can be helpful, as you conclude, to have an external framework or set of rules as a guide to keep our egos within certain boundaries. In addition, plain old common sense should never be lost sight of either. Unfortunately, and obviously, that does not stop people who appeal to God's Will or the Holy Spirit's guidance to justify whatever they do, thinking they are no longer bound by the world's laws and now follow a \"higher\" authority. But conforming to normal laws of civilized people is always advisable. Such conformity, though, should not be used as a measure of spiritual advancement. What you describe as your experience over the years is typical of most students. The theory is simple, but the practice is anything but that because of our investment in our lives as individual, special, needy persons--an investment we either overlook or sorely underestimate. We are entrenched in our defenses without even recognizing they are defenses. That is why Jesus stresses over and over again, especially in the workbook, that the heart of the practice of this Course is looking with him at all of the hatred and guilt in our minds. Consistently practicing this would enable us to recognize more clearly how our egos operate, what form our projections would most likely take, and how we defend against the fear of letting go of judgments, specialness, etc. Our focus should always be on letting go of the ego thoughts in our minds, and not on behavior. If we do this \"right,\" which means look within with the love of Jesus as our \"eyes,\" we would experience peace for more and more extended periods of time as we go along. But it usually takes the assessment of another person who knows us very well, to help discern whether the peace is genuine or not. Most people do not experience the Holy Spirit or Jesus as a voice speaking to them, such as was Helen Schucman's experience of Jesus. Her experience should not be taken as a criterion of what hearing the Holy Spirit should mean. That we are hearing the Voice for God is often indicated by our discovering that we have become less judgmental, less demanding that our specialness needs be met, less angry, less selfish, less depressed, etc. But again, this is not easy. We are masters of self-deception. Humility can go a long way toward keeping us honest."

    "text_input": "Q #44: How do I act in the world of form before I have been able to forgive a situation? If I act lovingly without really feeling it I will feel resentment. If I act according to my true feelings I will feel guilty. Either way I lose!!!",
    "output": "The key is always to be aware of your motivation in a conflict with someone else--the underlying purpose it serves, as you seem to struggle over how to act. \"What you do comes from what you think\" (T-2.VI.2:7), as Jesus points out. \"It is only at this level that you can exercise choice ... It is pointless to believe that controlling the outcome of misthought can result in healing ... You must change your mind, not your behavior, and this is a matter of willingness ... Change does not mean anything at the symptom level, where it cannot work\" (2:6; 3:1,4,7). We are stubborn creatures, not prone to forgiveness, although it is the most natural thing we can do in this world. But the world is an unnatural place. And so we resist what really would be kindest and most helpful to ourselves. So long as I think that acting lovingly towards others is a charitable whim I bestow on an undeserving someone outside of myself (W-pI.126.4:1), I will resent not getting in my \"justified\" licks against you if I feel you have treated me unfairly. But if I can honestly look at how a retaliatory attack on you will really make me feel, I may be more open to a right-minded solution. If I can begin to recognize that my reaction to you has nothing to do with what you have done and everything to do with the guilt in my own mind, which is the cause of all my pain and for which I am always seeking a target on which to project it, I may think twice about reinforcing that guilt in my own mind by a further overt attack on you. Forgiveness is not a gift bestowed on someone else, unmerited and unjustified. It is a gift I offer first and foremost to myself. When I accept that gift for myself, then I will automatically know how to respond to you who had seemed to offend me, offering you the same gift I have just accepted for myself, in the form in which you will most likely be able to accept it. And I will have no sense of resentment or loss associated with it. Okay, but what if I'm still too stubborn to believe and accept what is truly in my own best interest for a particular situation--I am not ready to forgive because I still want to hold on to my grievance against you so that I can believe the guilt is in you and not in me? Then I would want at least to be able to acknowledge that I am still identified with my ego, where my \"choices\" seem to be limited to either overtly attacking you in retaliation or sacrificing my right to retaliation in a feigned \"loving\" show of \"forgiveness\" (still an attack). Either option will reinforce my guilt if I act without awareness of my underlying motivation. And so these are not really different choices at all, at the level of content. So now it will be important that I at least be honest with myself, and recognize that it is neither kindness nor righteousness nor any evil within me that is guiding me to act in whatever way I finally choose with my ego, since I have already decided against choosing at the only level that can really help. It is my own fear of love and of the quiet, gentle peace that accompanies the release of grievances that is behind my resistance to asking for help from a different Teacher. If I can recognize that and not judge myself for it, then I have at least minimized the guilt that I am reinforcing in my own mind for continuing to identify with my ego. And that is always a goal of the Course."

    "text_input": "Q #45: My question refers to the process of helping others. In studying the Course, I realize that the world's salvation and my own is my only function. However, is there an accredited program or some kind of certification based on the Course that could be pursued, in a field such as psychotherapy or counseling?",
    "output": "To address the second part of your question first, sorry, but there can be no formal training based on the Course to prepare someone for the role of therapist or counselor because the Course has nothing to say about specific forms or roles. This does not mean that there may not be those who offer such a curriculum, but it is not really in line with the intentions of the Course as a spiritual teaching. You could be trained, for example, in psychoanalysis or behavioral therapy or Rogerian counseling, each of which employs a very different theoretical model and different techniques and practices from the other approaches, and still utilize the principles of the Course in your work with patients. This is because the Course is intended to help you change how you perceive situations and relationships within your own mind and has nothing to say about how you behave or act with others. And so any form of therapeutic practice, even if it may have initially been made to maintain separation, can be used for a truly healing outcome when it is placed under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. The supplement Psychotherapy: Purpose, Process and Practice does provide a helpful application of Course principles in a therapeutic context, but a careful reading of it makes it very clear that Jesus is only talking about what is going on within the mind of the therapist and is never making recommendations for how the therapist should act with the patient or client. The insights a therapist develops from the Course about the nature of reality and the purpose of the world and the self--first from the ego's perspective of the reality of sin and guilt, and then from the perspective of the Holy Spirit's healed perception--may or may not be things that would be appropriate to discuss with a patient. But it would always be the content of forgiveness and not any specific words or concepts that the therapist would want to share with the patient. And the content is shared in any instant when the therapist has released all the judgments he may be holding in his own mind against the patient, which are nothing more than the projections of judgments he is holding against himself. The pamphlet describes this process: \"The therapist sees in the patient all that he has not forgiven in himself, and is thus given another chance to look at it, open it to re-evaluation and forgive it. When this occurs, he sees his sins as gone into a past that is no longer here ... The patient is his screen for the projection of his sins, enabling him to let them go\" (P-2.VI.6:3-4,6). And to turn to your opening comments with just a few clarifications. When you speak of helping others, and observe that the Course speaks of the world's salvation and our own as our only function, you want to be sure that you understand what the world's salvation means. The workbook says that \"salvation of the world depends on me\" (W-pI.186.h). But the world's salvation does not refer to doing anything in the world or to having an effect on anything external, including others, in the world. The salvation of the world depends on my withdrawing the projections of guilt that I have placed upon the world, and then releasing those judgments from myself as well--the same process that we have just read from the Psychotherapy supplement. In the end, having no further purpose, the external world will disappear, just as the guilt we have projected on to it vanishes in the light of forgiveness. In other words, \"there is no world\" to save (W-pI.132.6:2). And so, in the meantime, before our mind is completely healed, we would not want any actions we take in the world to come from our own perception of what help others need--we do not know. All of our perceptions are based on a belief in the reality of separation, scarcity, lack and loss, so our own interventions will only serve to reinforce that belief in ourselves and others. We cannot possibly know or understand what real help is, in a separated state of mind. But when we release our own judgments, grievances and guilt, then the part of our mind--the Holy Spirit-- that does know is free to express Itself through us. And the help will then always be a reminder that sin and guilt and separation are not real, expressed in a form that can be accepted in another without increasing fear (T-2.IV.5). But we will have not made the decision on our own about how that is best done. As Jesus not so subtly observes, \"Your function here is only to decide against deciding what you want, in recognition that you do not know. How, then, can you decide what you should do? Leave all decisions to the One Who speaks for God, and for your function as He knows it\" (T-14.IV.5:2-4)."

    "text_input": "Q #46: What does the Course say about feelings? I know it says we shouldn't deny our feelings. Could you say more on this. Are we to listen to what our feelings are telling us?",
    "output": "Feelings is not used very often in the Course, since it's focus is on thoughts. But in order to access our thoughts, it is very important that we be in touch with our feelings. If we are not aware of how we feel, then we are that much farther removed from our thoughts. So one of the first practical steps a student of the Course may take is that of becoming more and more aware of how they feel. This can often times be a painful process, since more often than not, our painful feelings are denied. Once we allow these feelings to arise within us, we are tempted to shove them back down again because they are unpleasant. For some of us, we may only deny particular feelings, such as anger, grief, or jealousy, etc. Society teaches us what we \"should\" and \"should not\" feel, and then the Course comes along, and as spiritual seekers, we impose additional \"shoulds\" and \"should nots.\" It is no wonder no one knows how they feel! Once we are in touch with how we feel, we can then begin the process of discovering what thought caused the feeling. We do not have to don our Sherlock Holmes hats and search and search for these thoughts, as over-intellectualizing the process simply becomes another obstacle. Search your mind as best you can, but more importantly, give Jesus or the Holy Spirit your willingness to know what the thought is. And in most instances, even those having to do with anger, you will find that your thoughts have to do with loss of some kind. Once you are aware of the thought you then have the choice to change the thought, or not. But at least you have found the true source of your pain. It is not anything outside of you, but rather the thoughts you hold within. As Jesus tells us in the text: \"This is the only thing that you need do for vision, happiness, release from pain and the complete escape from sin, all to be given you. Say only this, but mean it with no reservations, for here the power of salvation lies: I am responsible for what I see. I choose the [thoughts and] feelings I experience, and I decide upon the goal I would achieve. And everything that seems to happen to me I ask for, and receive as I have asked. Deceive yourself no longer that you are helpless in the face of what is done to you. Acknowledge but that you have been mistaken, and all effects of your mistakes will disappear\" (T-21.II.2:1-7)."

Now, I have recently been given information that has made me question the action. At the time, I felt this was the most loving and kind thing. I find this very disturbing and have revisited the audio on \"Rules for Decision.\" I think I've never given up the guilt or the blame for taking the action. I know the Course is a process; I've been a student for 12 years, but when this happened I questioned that I've made any progress. I know that the Course is not about doing things in this world. Am I dealing with 2 different situations or am I still in the original one problem?",
    "output": "If you felt you did the most loving and kind thing, then you should stay with that. You know, we have limited ourselves so much, and have erected so many layers of defenses by choosing to think we are bodies, that we simply are not in touch with what is going on beneath the surface of our conscious awareness. We cannot see the larger picture at all; therefore, we do not know where we are on our Atonement path. So it is not helpful to question our progress. That is where having Jesus as our teacher is so helpful. By following his directions in his Course, we are led deeper and deeper into our minds, and we slowly begin to get in touch with the underlying motivations for our actions and thought patterns. So the experience you had is not at all uncommon. We all can look back at decisions we've made that seem to have been the right ones, but now, because we have uncovered more of what we had kept hidden about ourselves in our minds, we realize that we had overlooked something or had simply deceived ourselves. That is to be expected as we go along, but feeling guilty over it is not helpful. Feeling guilty will only reinforce the problem and keep the solution concealed. The \"proper\" response is to feel grateful that you have learned something more about how your ego operates, so that you now can be more vigilant for those kinds of ploys. It is a humbling experience, but if you accept that your purpose is to journey--with Jesus' love guiding you-- into the darkness in your mind, you will not be so surprised to discover these instances of self- deception. Ultimately, you will recognize that the whole thing is a defense against the light and the love that is there, and that is our true reality."

One can state this uniqueness in general terms as being the integration of a non-dualistic metaphysics, which states that only the non-material God is real, with a sophisticated psychological approach, heavily based on Freud's insights into the human psyche. This integration helps us live within the illusory world under the principle of forgiveness, taught to us by the Holy Spirit. In general, we can also say that if a student of A Course in Miracles benefits from another spiritual path, and such integration helps the student become kinder and more forgiving, then that needs no justification or comment. It is always helpful to return to the basic Course teaching of content rather than form, and to recall the statement at the end of the manual for teachers: \"The curriculum is highly individualized, and all aspects are under the Holy Spirit's particular care and guidance\" (M-29.2:6). Therefore, read and study whatever is helpful. What is most important is the degree to which you are able to practice forgiveness, rather than seeking to understand it."

    "text_input": "Q #49: The Course says the world was made as an attack on God. It also says that the body is neutral. Since they are both illusions, should they not be seen as neutral?",
    "output": "The Course also says that \"the body is a limit on love\tit was made to limit the unlimited\" T- 18.VIII.1:2-3). Everything of the ego, including the power to choose or decide, and all the defenses to protect and maintain the ego's survival, was made as an attack on the Love and the Oneness of God. But everything that the ego made to separate, the Holy Spirit can use for healing, if we are willing to offer it to Him. It always comes down to a question of purpose--any illusion, once invested with our belief in its reality, can be used either for the purpose of the ego or for the purpose of the Holy Spirit. So yes, both the body and the world--made to defy God and His creation and prove that we are more powerful than He, but then covered over by the belief that we are our bodies, vulnerable and frail, victims of the overwhelming forces of a victimizing world--now become neutral, awaiting our choice as to whose purpose they will serve. And that is what makes the Course's teachings so gentle, not seeing the body and the world as obstacles in themselves to be overcome on the journey back to God. Sacrifice of what we think we cherish--things of the body and of the world--are called for by most other spiritual teachings. However, the Course asks only that we be willing to have their purpose transformed until, in the end, we willingly discard them as no longer of value to us, \"functionless, unneeded and cast off ... to be replaced for greater good\" (W-pII.294.1:9-10). But so long as the body and the world still have value to us, we are not asked to give them up. It is our beliefs or thoughts about the body and the world that are not neutral. The Course makes this very clear: \"No belief is neutral\" (T-24.in.2:3); \"I have no neutral thoughts\" (W-pI.16.h). And so it is at the level of thought or belief that the Course teaches that change has to be made. It is our beliefs or thoughts that give everything in the world its purpose. And all thought comes from either the ego or the Holy Spirit. Accepting the ego's thought system reinforces our belief in the reality of sin, guilt and fear and their defenses--the world and the body. Turning to the Holy Spirit's thought system undoes that belief, first allowing us not to take the things of the world, including ourselves, so seriously, and then leading us in the end to recognize that all of the ego's beliefs and their manifestations are unreal or illusory. Once we have recognized their unreality, they will no longer have any value for us and can be easily released."

    "text_input": "Q #50: If the process of forgiveness is the basis of the Course, why does Jesus not just concentrate on that and give us all the techniques or advice in the most \"practical\" way possible? Anyway, do you have any techniques, advice or other? I am just desperate with the difficulty of the work!!!",
    "output": "First of all, you have a lot of company! Many, many people share your feelings about their work with the Course. The Course is highly practical, but unfortunately, not in the way we would like it to be. We would like it to tell us what to do behaviorally in specific situations. It does not offer us practical advice or techniques on that level, though, because that is not its focus. It is a Course in changing our minds (content) not our behavior (form). It is a Course in cause, not effect, as Jesus tells us in a moving part of \"The 'Hero' of the Dream\" section in Chapter 27 of the text: \"In gentle laughter does the Holy Spirit perceive the cause, and looks not to effects. How else could He correct your error, who have overlooked the cause entirely? He bids you bring each terrible effect to Him that you may look together on its foolish cause and laugh with Him a while. You judge effects, but He has judged their cause. And by His judgment are effects removed\" (T-27.VIII.9:1-5). Therefore, the Course says nothing about behavior, which is what so many students find frustrating. We would like to be told exactly what to do as we go about interacting with people and having to make all kinds of decisions about our lives. It does tell us what to do, but not in the behavioral sense. The workbook lessons are very specific about what we should do when we become upset, angry, judgmental, fearful, sick, etc. But the instructions are geared exclusively to the decision-making capacities of our minds, from which our behavior flows. Our behavior emanates from the thought system we have chosen in our minds. So the work of the Course centers entirely on that dimension, because that is where the cause of all of our problems and distress lies. Our bodily states are just the effects of the cause. Therefore, we can be helped most effectively by working with the contents of our minds. That is the kind of help Jesus offers us in his Course. This is part of what makes the Course unique in its approach to spirituality. Yet sometimes concentrating on behavioral changes is helpful and even necessary, especially when addictions are involved. Often, internal work cannot begin until one's emotional and physical status is fairly stable. But the relief from pain, anxiety, guilt, fear, etc. is usually not permanent when changes are made only on the behavioral level, with no corresponding change in the mind. The Course teaches us that we have concealed the deepest sources of motivation in our minds, so if we don't get to that level, we will never have lasting internal peace, despite behavioral changes. By applying the teachings and principles of the Course, we are promised an end to all of our pain and all of our problems. There are two striking passages, among others, that describe the Course's orientation and approach to healing the pain and solving the problems of our lives: \"Certain it is that all distress does not appear to be but unforgiveness. Yet that is the content underneath the form\" (W- pI.193.4:1-2); \"Of one thing you were sure: Of all the many causes you perceived as bringing pain and suffering to you, your guilt was not among them\" (T-27.VII.7:4). So Jesus tells us in these passages, as well as in dozens of others, that we know neither what our problems are nor their solutions. We had best, then, ask his help and follow his guidance, as he knows what our problems truly are, and how they can be solved. One should not mistake its emphasis on content to mean that the Course advocates complete license to behave in whatever way one chooses. This is clearly not its direction. It does not focus on behavior because of its metaphysical premises, primary of which is the principle that the world is nothing but the projection of a thought in our minds. And since \"ideas leave not their source,\" the world remains in the mind and therefore is not what it appears to us to be. Neither is the body. So by staying on a behavioral level, we are limiting the extent of healing that can occur. For some people, however, changing behavior is a helpful place to start the process of getting back in touch with the power of the mind that we have dissociated. It often would reflect the mind's decision to be more loving and kind to oneself, which is actually an application of Course principles. Having completed some other therapy or training, a person may choose to return to the Course, and then be better able to learn and practice what it teaches."

    "text_input": "Q #51: I was intrigued by Ken Wapnick's phraseology in his discussion of The Song of Prayer and the use of language in the Course. It reads: \"This ... is ... a wonderful portrait of the Course's path of forgiving the arrogant world of guilt, illusion, and specificity through looking at the ego with humility and without fear.\" How do I look at the ego with humility? I can hardly imagine looking at it without judgment, never mind with humility!",
    "output": "Looking at the ego without judgment is looking at it with humility. The ego in its arrogance would have us shrink back in horror when we realize the extent of its deception, scheming and viciousness. This horror comes from the arrogance of trying to fool ourselves into thinking we are egoless, more spiritually advanced than we actually are, or that we are capable of evaluating ourselves at all. To begin with, it takes humility to recognize just how much we don't want the peace of God, how firmly we cling to our belief system, the pursuit of our selfish interests, and our individual specialness. Reacting with shock and dismay in recognizing this comes from arrogance. The Course tells us it is our arrogance that has us hold a demeaning image of ourselves, thus denying our true identity: \"Arrogance makes an image of yourself that is not real. It is this image which quails and retreats in terror, as the Voice for God assures you that you have the strength, the wisdom and the holiness to go beyond all images\" (W-pI.186.6:1-2). One of the most frequently repeated lines in the Course is \"I am as God created me\" (W-pI.94). In our arrogance we deny this identity, deciding for ourselves who we are, what we do, and why. The ego even has us believe humility is looking upon ourselves as lowly and unworthy. The Course teaches us just the opposite. We are told: \"Humility consists of accepting your role in salvation and in taking no other\" (W-pI.61.2:3). It asks us to learn to see ourselves along with all our brothers and sisters as worthy of God's love. It does indeed take humility to look honestly but calmly, without judgment, at the arrogance of the ego, and then, as has often been stated, smile at it. We look at the ego with humility when we are willing to question our point of view, our interpretation and our definition of ourselves, of everyone and everything we encounter. If we are then willing to let go of our interpretation, we can step out of the ego's arrogant stance and accept the Holy Spirit's perception. This is true humility."

    "text_input": "Q #52: Is it wrong to feel guilty about tragic world events, such as starvation in Africa, etc.? Often, when I see situations of people suffering in poorer countries, I feel guilty and think, \"Look at the easy life I have. I really have nothing to complain about.\" Is my guilt in this situation really just an attempt to retain a sense of specialness and separateness?",
    "output": "Guilt and blame are never justified, according to the Course. But the guilt you are feeling more than likely is coming from a deeper source than you mention, and can be undone only on that level. All of us would feel a deep sense of guilt simply because we are here. Our existence in this world is at God's expense, so the ego has convinced us. We in essence stole God's creative power and conferred it on ourselves so that we could direct our own lives in a world that could give us the specialness and individuality that was not available in Heaven. The guilt associated with our existence here is enormous as a result, and is deliberately kept out of awareness through denial and projection. This dynamic of projection requires that there be a world in which terrible things happen, so that we can perceive both victims and victimizers outside us, rather than in the bloody battlefield in our minds, where we are terrified that God will come storming after us and destroy us for our abominable attack on Him. So there is a second tier of guilt in our minds that comes from our wanting there to be suffering in the world to keep our defense of projection working, which in turn maintains this system of existence outside Heaven and God. Even though the ego assured us that we would be free of guilt by projecting both ourselves and our guilt from the mind, we wind up feeling guilty as bodies in a world of bodies anyway. We feel guilty when we are doing well because deep within our minds we know we got it all illegitimately. And we feel guilty when we see others not doing so well, because on an unconscious level we feel responsible for their suffering and poverty. It reminds us of our complicity in a plan to have a world of affliction and unsolvable problems so that we would never remember that the only problem is that we made the wrong decision in our minds, and that we can simply go back to our minds, guided by Jesus or the Holy Spirit, and now make the right decision. Finally, we have to be wary of our tendency to interpret events by form only. In other words, the external form cannot tell us what is going on in a person's Atonement path, the content. Perhaps suffering or poverty is the classroom that that mind is using to learn that the body is not our true reality. We don't know that, so we should be cautious about judging what appear to be unfortunate situations. We really cannot see the larger picture. We also need to remember that one of the central principles of the Course is that there is no hierarchy of illusions. The bottom line is that kindness and gentleness to all people, regardless of their situation, should be our guiding principle."

    "text_input": "Q #53: Does being active in political and social programs inappropriately reinforce the dream from which we are trying to awaken? Should one work solely on the self? Isn't that the best way to address the world's ill?",
    "output": "First, the Course is exclusively about the healing of our minds, because that is where our one and only problem and its solution reside: our decision to be separate, and our capacity to undo that choice. \"Forget not that the healing of God's Son is all the world is for\" (T-24.VI.4:1). On one level, therefore, we can help the world most effectively by undoing the guilt in our minds, because the projection of this guilt is what made the world and all its problems, and what sustains it as well. The world, thus, is but an idea in our minds and has never left its source in our minds. If we could identify with this totally and then undo the guilt, the world would disappear back into the nothingness from which it came, and we would be back home in God. Then \"nothing that you remember now will you remember\" (T-19.IV-D.6:6). However, because we have not fully integrated this principle, our experience is that there is a world and we are influenced by it in many ways. It is a highly significant part of our dream and of our script. Therefore, on this level we cannot ignore it or be indifferent or passive about what takes place in the world, just as ignoring or denying bodily conditions is an \"unworthy form of denial\" (T-2.IV.3:11). Two principles that can guide us on this level are (1) there is no hierarchy of illusions, and (2) purpose is everything. Thus, being politically or socially active is no different than performing surgery, competing in sports, or eating and breathing in order to stay alive. In this sense, we cannot say that one reinforces the dream more than another. They are neutral once we identify with bodily existence. It is only when we consider purpose that we can begin to evaluate the helpfulness of what we do for our Atonement path. Being involved in political or social movements, or just stopping to help a person injured in an accident, can either reinforce the separation or undo it, depending on whether we have chosen the ego or Jesus as our teacher. It is not the behavior, in other words, that helps or hinders our spiritual advancement. The pivotal issue is whether we have chosen in our minds to see our interests as separate or the same as another person's. None of this should be taken to mean that one must be involved in political or social programs. It is entirely a matter of how one is guided. It is neither inherently wrong-minded nor right-minded to be active in the world. We just need to be vigilant about using Course principles to justify aloofness or indifference. It is indeed a fine line to walk and requires considerable experience and maturity to both integrate the teachings of the Course and yet do what normal and compassionate people do who are citizens of a country."

    "text_input": "Q #54: What is the definition of intelligence as it is used in the Course? Is intelligence a part of the ego or a glimpse of the Divine?",
    "output": "Intelligence is a function of the brain; it is therefore part of the operational system of the body, not to be confused with the mind, which is not in the brain and does not require intelligence. That is not to say that the mind does not make use of the brain, as it does the body, in our illusory experience of being in a body in this dream state. The Course statements regarding the body can thus be applied to the brain/intelligence. It is neutral, and can be used by the Holy Spirit or the ego for their respective goals. This is true of any ability or skill attributed to the body. The Course itself is an example of the use of the intellect as a form, using language, metaphysical principles, psychological terms, etc., to reflect a choice in the mind to turn toward the love and truth which is the content. It is one form helpful to the Sonship to learn to accept love, but it is not the only form. In the manual we are told: \"This is a manual for a special curriculum, intended for teachers of a special form of the universal course. There are many thousands of other forms, all with the same outcome\" (M-1.4:1-2). We easily become confused when it comes to the brain and intelligence because we still think \"that [our] understanding is a powerful contribution to the truth, and makes it what it is\" (T- 18.IV.7:5). We hold our intellectual abilities in high regard, failing to realize that the mind is the true home of thought, having nothing to do with the illusory thoughts that generate from our brains. The healing of the mind through forgiveness does not require intelligence, it requires willingness, which is a function of the mind. The mind can be willing and can in fact make a choice for healing without the need for intellect/intelligence. Otherwise intellectual ability and/or intelligence would obviously be a requirement for salvation and that would exclude a large segment of the Sonship (those who are mentally incapacitated, have brain dysfunctions, are comatose, etc.) We certainly have all had the experience of being completely baffled by a particular passage at one time only to have absolute clarity as to its meaning at a later reading. Our intelligence had nothing to do with the confusion or with the clarity. The confusion came from our resistance; the clarity from our willingness. A person with limited intelligence may come to the Course with little resistance and a high degree of willingness and thus be open to learning the content of the Course: its message of love and forgiveness. An intellectually gifted person, on the other hand, may be blocked by tremendous resistance and fail to grasp the true message of the Course, in spite of intellectually mastering the principles of its metaphysics. Although we are making use of our brains to read, study and even apply the teachings of the Course in our lives, the real activity is going on in the mind that is choosing to turn toward the light and truth of the Course's message. The intellectual activity is the reflection of that choice, but it is not a requirement, and it is certainly not a glimpse of the Divine. Very intellectually limited persons have been brilliant reflections of light and love in the world, while intellectually gifted persons have remained entrenched in the ego's darkness. In our study and practice of the Course it becomes apparent that however much we intellectually understand or do not understand the principles of the Course, it is the application of these principles with sincere willingness that makes them effective in bringing about our healing and the experience of peace. As we read: \"Salvation, perfect and complete, asks but a little wish that what is true be true; a little willingness to overlook what is not there; a little sigh that speaks for Heaven as a preference to this world that death and desolation seem to rule. In joyous answer will creation rise within you, to replace the world you see with Heaven, wholly perfect and complete. What is forgiveness but a willingness that truth be true?\" (T-26.VII.10:1-3)"

    "text_input": "Q #55: The following answers are in response to different questions posed by the same person.  : Can you help me understand why we must secretly hate those who have positive qualities that we ourselves do not possess, such as being very spiritual, unselfish, kind, etc.?",
    "output": "The ego would tell us this, based on its \"law\" that \"you have what you have taken\" (T- 23.II.9:3). This \"law\" rests on the fundamental ego belief in separation and differences. Differences are real and important, and need to be evaluated (the ego's hierarchy of illusions). The concealed origin of this in our minds is our belief that we got to be who we are by stealing our existence from God. He would not give us the special, individual existence we wanted, so we took it for ourselves and left Him behind, seemingly destroyed and \"out of the picture.\" We justified this theft by projecting responsibility for it and declaring that God withheld from us what rightfully belonged to us. This is the Course's mythological rendering of the origin of our existence. There are many more dynamics and levels to this story, obviously, but this is the aspect that is relevant to your question. It is this core belief about ourselves that is the lens through which we perceive each other. Thus, when we perceive others as having qualities that we lack and wished we had, we must automatically--though unconsciously--conclude that those qualities originally belonged to us and were stolen. Again, this is coming from the deeply buried belief that we took from God what rightfully belonged to us, a perversion of what we really believe, which is that we brutally \"killed\" God so that we could exist the way we wanted, not as He created us. This is the ego thought system. The other aspect to this is that even if we think we simply admire qualities in others, we are secretly upholding the ego's thought system of separation. Jesus corrects these mistaken beliefs by helping us look at our need to see others as different from us, whether in a positive sense or a negative sense. When we see where this need is coming from and can begin to evaluate it as nothing but a \"tiny, mad idea\" worthy only of gentle laughter, we are ready to shift to Jesus' way of perceiving each other. He would have us learn to see one another as sharing a common interest, both in our wrong minds--motivated by fear-- and in our right minds--motivated by our willingness to join with him and undo our belief in separation. The differences we perceive then will have less and less significance to us, and we will be more and more inclined to see what makes us all the same. Our resistance to this is far stronger than we realize, though. The world intractably values \"differences that make a difference,\" and so this invitation to shift our way of perceiving will be met with fierce resistance. What all of this means ultimately is that you can never truly love someone who you perceive is different from you. That deserves a lot of thought. A prime example of this--particularly relevant for students of the Course--is Jesus. As we know, the Bible identified him as God's \"only begotten Son,\" the innocent, sinless Son who had to be sacrificed for our sins. Thus, for thousands of years he has been portrayed as qualitatively, ontologically different from us. It is hard to feel truly close to someone who is so far beyond what we could ever be, and who was killed because of our sinfulness. Jesus addresses this in so many ways in the Course, basically imploring us to see that image of him as having come only from the ego's obsession with separation, guilt, and sacrifice. It is simply not loving. This is one of the major corrections he presents in his Course. He says he is different, but only temporarily, and that \"walking with him is just as natural as walking with a brother whom you knew since you were born, for such indeed he is\" (C-5.5:6). Jesus would have us see our sameness; the ego would have us see our differences. : When the Course talks about the pearl of great price that we think was stolen by another, what does it mean? A: This is discussed in the context of the fourth law of chaos \"you have what you have taken\" (T-23.II.9-11). The \"priceless pearl\" is whatever we think is missing or lacking in us. Ultimately, on the ontological level, this would be the innocence we believe we sacrificed when we chose our individuality over our inheritance as God's one Son, from then on seeing ourselves as sinful and in conflict with God, Who we are sure will come after us to punish us for what we did. The \"priceless pearl\" can also be thought of as our specialness. This, too, is rooted in the sense of lack or scarcity that we all feel deep within, along with the ongoing feeling that we are at war with God. We experience this guilt (lack of innocence, scarcity) in different forms, such as inadequacy, deficiency, inferiority, envy, etc. And \"behind the scenes,\" we would always be blaming someone for what is lacking in us (projection). These dynamics rest ultimately on the ego principle of one or the other. If you are guilty, I am innocent. If I am guilty, you are innocent and I must do whatever it takes to get that \"priceless pearl\" from you, because it was mine and you unjustifiably stole it. This is the underpinning of the psychological cannibalism that we all engage in, and obviously the forms of physical cannibalism as well. It is no wonder that Jesus uses the label \"laws of chaos\"!"

    "text_input": "Q #56: If on one level, as the Course suggests, we are responsible for our lives and our choices and deeds, why would I choose to be such a fool? Why wouldn't all of us or most of us choose to enter this world as children of loving, spiritual, intelligent, wealthy and genetically sound parents?",
    "output": "Yes, if it's really my choice, why indeed would I set things up so miserably for myself? The answer lies in understanding that my secret goal, kept hidden even from myself, is to be the victim of others in all of my relationships so that I never get in touch with the real cause of my misery. We think the world, beginning with our parents and continuing with all our subsequent relationships, is the cause of our pain and unhappiness. But it is not. The world and all of our relationships are only a clever, self-manufactured diversion to keep the real source of our unhappiness--our all-consuming desire that the separation be real, at any cost--hidden from ourselves. But why would we want to keep the real source hidden? The reason is that we value our individual, separate self more than all the love and happiness in the universe, and we'd even be willing to kill for it. But we'd rather not admit to that. Because if we did, then we might be more willing to let go of our identification with the ego and the special individual self that we each think we are. For what could our experience be but pain and unhappiness and lovelessness if we could in reality separate ourselves from Love? We make up an external world, starting with our parents, out of all the guilt, pain, attack and murder that we have imagined in our mind--thoughts that seem very real and frightening to us once we seek to make the separation real. As the Course describes it: \"The world you perceive is a world of separation. Perhaps you are willing to accept even death to deny your Father...it is governed by the desire to be unlike God ... The world you made is therefore totally chaotic, governed by arbitrary and senseless 'laws,' and without meaning of any kind. For it is made out of what you do not want, projected from your mind because you are afraid of it\" (T-12.III.9:1-2,5-7). The world then is the effect and not the cause of how we feel, no matter how much we may have convinced ourselves otherwise. And so it follows, \"If the cause of the world you see is attack thoughts, you must learn that it is these thoughts which you do not want. There is no point in lamenting the world. There is no point in trying to change the world. It is incapable of change because it is merely an effect. But there is indeed a point in changing your thoughts about the world. Here you are changing the cause. The effect will change automatically\" (W-pI.23.2). And so even if we could make the world and all of our relationships in any way we want, the building blocks are still the contents of the ego mind, and the goal remains the same--to see myself as a victim, with anyone but myself responsible for all my problems and how I feel. And that is what determines our experience in the world, regardless of the form the world may take, so long as the ego thought system remains our choice. As a result, even if I set it up to be the child of \"loving, intelligent, wealthy and genetically sound parents\", I will still not be happy. And I will still find some reason to blame others, starting with my parents, for my unhappiness, until I'm ready to ask for another way. And that other way will involve looking within my own mind to uncover the blocks that I have placed there to the awareness of love's presence, so that they can be removed (T-in.1:7). And the happiness I will then experience will have nothing to do with anything in the external world, including my parents."

    "text_input": "Q #57: I have recently entered a 12-step program for substance abuse. It seems to be making a positive difference. I know Ken has said that we have to deal with some problems on the world's terms, but only so that we can see them for what they are. Is there anything else I should know in trying to reconcile this program, which makes the problem very real, with my continuing study of the Course?",
    "output": "It is usually very helpful to attempt to resolve the symptoms of whatever illness we may be dealing with before we will be ready to address the deeper, underlying causes of our distress that the Course helps us get in touch with. If we are experiencing a medical crisis such as a heart attack or appendicitis, we would first want to get the appropriate medical attention to relieve the physical symptoms. Likewise, if we are trapped in some kind of addictive, self-destructive behavior, the first step would be to bring the addiction under control. And twelve-step programs are usually very effective for bringing about such changes. Now it is true that, from the Course's perspective, such programs do not resolve the underlying source of the distress, but developing some discipline and control around self-abusive behavior is often an essential first step in the process. As a student of the Course, we would want to recognize that such interventions can be extremely helpful and that there are further steps then to be taken. Anything that attempts to solve a problem at the level of the world, rather than addressing the underlying cause of the problem in the mind, is what the Course calls magic. Most of us live our lives using magic much if not all of the time to deal with what we see as our problems. The interventions for the medical problems and addictions described above would all be considered magic, from the Course's perspective. Although the Course teaches that magic does not heal (T-2.IV.4:3)--true healing comes only from releasing the guilt of self-condemnation in our own mind--the Course should never be construed as taking a position against magic. In fact, Jesus recognizes that while our fear is still too great, \"it may be wise to utilize a compromise approach to mind and body, in which something from the outside is temporarily given healing belief\" (4:6). Furthermore, since all form in the world is neutral and the Course teaches that our only real concern should be the purpose we give it (T-4.V.6:8-9), the key in using anything such as a 12- step program to deal with a problem like an addiction would be to be aware of how you are using it. If you use it to reinforce your belief in the reality of your weakness and limitations, and as a means to see yourself as separate and different from others, then it will be serving an ego purpose. But if you see it as a means of being kind to yourself, of recognizing that you need help that comes from outside your ego self, and that you are the same as everyone else--despite differences in the forms of our lives, we are all caught in the ego trap of believing in guilt and attack and fear--then it will be serving the Holy Spirit's purpose. And it would not be unusual to find yourself vacillating back and forth between these two different purposes. You are right, of course, that the Course and the 12-step program cannot in the end be reconciled as spiritual paths--they are saying different things and any attempt to combine them will significantly diminish the efficacy of both. You may find it helpful to remind yourself, as you participate in the 12-step process over time, that the only problem is our addiction to the guilt in our mind, which we think keeps us \"safe\" from love. We project that guilt out into the various forms of conflict in our lives to avoid getting in touch with the real problem in the mind. And substance abuse is just one of the many forms of external conflict we set up for ourselves in the world to avoid looking at the guilt within. But once you understand what you made the problem of substance abuse for, you can give it a different purpose. Substance abuse then, rather than being the real problem, is seen as a symptom or manifestation of the underlying problem of the guilt in your mind. By acknowledging the external problem, you provide yourself an avenue to get back in touch with the problem of the guilt buried deep in your mind. And by releasing the guilt and judgment that you have associated with your substance abuse, you will find that your need for a defense against the guilt in your mind, which the substance abuse has provided, diminishes over time. So the ultimate focus for your healing work is not on the external problem of substance abuse but on the buried guilt it is allowing you to get in touch with. However, through an in-depth examination of your substance abuse problem, including identifying those whom you may blame for driving you into the abuse and evaluating the effects of the abuse on your current and past relationships--areas for which a 12-step program can be very helpful--you will be able to trace your guilt through its \"circuitous routes\" (T-15.X.5:1) in form back to its origins in your mind, where it can then be undone."

    "text_input": "Q #58: Recently while having a fight with my wife I turned to the Course for help by reading the passage about seeing only an expression of love or a call for love. Later I was able to reach out to her in a loving way. I find that I don't consider her small outbursts and annoying irritations \"big\" enough to qualify as calls for love. It seems best not to take them seriously, though I resent that they take away the feeling of success in practicing the Course that I had when I applied the Course to the fight. Is it better to shrug off these small irritations or should I see them as calls for love also?",
    "output": "The Course does in fact say that everything is either an expression of love or a call for love (see T-14.X.7). Therefore, when someone is having an outburst of any kind, large or small, it is always a call for love and the Course asks us to respond with love. If our response is anything less than love it is of the ego, and we are in the same insane situation as the other person: we too are calling for love. It is very important in our practice of the Course to be vigilant for any underlying feeling or reaction in our experiences and our relationships. Even when we seem to be shrugging things off or waiting for an outburst to blow over, there is probably some annoyance, irritation or judgment going on. As the Course so clearly states; \"The degree of the emotion you experience does not matter. You will become increasingly aware that a slight twinge of annoyance is nothing but a veil drawn over intense fury\" (W-pI.21.2:4-5). This puts all of our interactions in the same category: there is no distinction between \"big\" or \"small,\" neither in the call for help nor in our reaction to it. The Course tells us that a choice to turn away from the light of the Holy Spirit in our minds, to throw our peace away by denying our unity with God, precedes that situation or interaction that seems to cause our reaction. The guilt and pain of that choice is the source of what appears as anger, annoyance, or irritation. Then a situation or an interaction with another person occurs, which we use to project our guilt onto, in the form of a reaction, or as the Course tells us \"an interpretation\": \"Perhaps it will be helpful to remember that no one can be angry at a fact. It is always an interpretation that gives rise to negative emotions, regardless of their seeming justification by what appears as facts. Regardless, too, of the intensity of the anger that is aroused. It may be merely slight irritation, perhaps too mild to be even clearly recognized. Or it may also take the form of intense rage, accompanied by thoughts of violence, fantasied or apparently acted out. It does not matter. All of these reactions are the same. They obscure the truth, and this can never be a matter of degree. Either truth is apparent, or it is not. It cannot be partially recognized. Who is unaware of truth must look upon illusions\" (M-17.4). The truth that is obscured can be understood on two levels: 1) we have made a choice, as explained above, that is causing us pain, anger, or annoyance, and now we blame a person or situation; 2) neither the choice nor the guilt we feel about it can have any effect on the Father's love for us, nor our love for the Father; in other words, nothing has happened. It is clear that there are no degrees or distinctions in any of this; we are expressing love or calling for love, we are at peace or not at peace, we are with the truth or with illusion, seeing with the ego or with the Holy Spirit. Our practice of the Course, therefore, is always optimum, whether we apply its teachings to something seemingly insignificant or to something we may judge as life threatening; nothing is too small or too big. It also means that every situation is important to our learning, and nothing should be overlooked or left to blow over. The decision to see differently, to listen to the Holy Spirit's interpretation, will bring us the same peace no matter what kind of a predicament we think we are in. It may also be helpful to remember: \" ... the Holy Spirit's vision is merciful and His remedy is quick. Do not hide suffering from His sight, but bring it gladly to Him. Lay before His eternal sanity all your hurt, and let Him heal you. Do not leave any spot of pain hidden from His light, and search your mind carefully for any thoughts you may fear to uncover. For He will heal every little thought you have kept to hurt you and cleanse it of its littleness, restoring it to the magnitude of God\" (T-13.III.7:2-6)."

    "text_input": "Q #59: After all this time of studying the Course, I'm still not real clear on what forgiveness really is. Let's say my ego mind labels someone as being a jerk. Well, I know on one level that I can't possibly be right in that evaluation--I don't really know this person and besides, I can't judge another even if sometimes I do. So, what's the next step? Not only have I made an unfair judgment; I've ended up feeling guilty for it.",
    "output": "When you take a minute or two to think differently about your judgment of another person, as you describe in your question, you have begun the forgiveness process, \"A light has entered the darkness\" (M-1.1:4). The first step is being willing to admit that we are wrong in our evaluation, and that there is another way of looking at the person. The next steps are being willing to let go of the original judgment, ask for another way of perceiving, and accept the new perception when it comes to you. This does not mean that you will no longer see people do foolish things. It means that you will not confuse the person's true identity with the foolish behavior, nor condemn him for it, nor consider it a \"sin.\" People do and say foolish things; that is a fact. There are then two interpretations: one according to the ego, which says this foolish behavior makes this person a \"jerk\"; the other according to the Holy Spirit (forgiveness), which says the foolish behavior does not change the real fact that this person is not a \"sinner,\" and does not deserve my condemnation. This applies as well to the judgment against yourself. We might say that calling another person a \"jerk\" is foolish behavior. This does not mean you are a sinner deserving of punishment, but that you have made a mistake, and are in need of a new perception, a correction, forgiveness. The guilt that seems to be at the end of the process, after judging a person as a \"jerk,\" was actually already present in the mind prior to the \"attack.\" The guilt was projected out to the \"jerk\" in the form of the judgment, which then seems to cause the guilt. This is an example of the Course teaching: \"Ideas leave not their source, and their effects but seem to be apart from them. Ideas are of the mind. What is projected out, and seems to be external to the mind, is not outside at all, but an effect of what is in, and has not left its source\" (T-26.VII.4:7-9). The origin of the process is a thought of separation in the mind, followed by a judgment against yourself for the thought, and guilt for having thought it. The guilt is then projected out to someone else in the form of an attack, and it then returns to the mind in the form of guilt for the attack. This is the circular thinking of the ego's game of guilt. Forgiveness asks that we recognize the original thought, and accept responsibility for the process. The way to forgive yourself for the original thought of separation is to offer forgiveness to the \"jerk\" by seeing him as no different from yourself; i.e., being in need of healing and of correction, and no different in his true identity as a holy Son of God: \"Let not the form of his mistakes keep you from him whose holiness is yours. Let not the vision of his holiness, the sight of which would show you your forgiveness, be kept from you by what the body's eyes can see. Let your awareness of your brother not be blocked by your perception of his sins and of his body. What is there in him that you would attack except what you associate with his body, which you believe can sin? Beyond his errors is his holiness and your salvation. You gave him not his holiness, but tried to see your sins in him to save yourself. And yet, his holiness is your forgiveness\" (T-22.III.8:1-7)."

    "text_input": "Q #60: I seem to remember a passage that states the use of \"white lies\" may at times be appropriate in dealing with some relationships. What is Jesus saying here? I can only seem to relate it to the 12-step saying where we should always try to make amends except when to do so would cause more harm.",
    "output": "We have all experienced occasions when it is obvious that telling someone the truth on the level of form is simply not the loving thing to do. While there are no passages in the Course that specifically mention \"white lies,\" there are two passages that address this issue, and that relate to the 12-step saying you mention: \"The value of the Atonement does not lie in the manner in which it is expressed. In fact, if it is used truly, it will inevitably be expressed in whatever way is most helpful to the receiver. This means that a miracle, to attain its full efficacy, must be expressed in a language that the recipient can understand without fear. This does not necessarily mean that it is the highest level of communication of which he is capable. It does mean, however, that it is the highest level of communication of which he is capable now. The whole aim of the miracle is to raise the level of communication, not to lower it by increasing fear\" (T-2.IV.5). In another passage Jesus says, \"Recognize what does not matter, and if your brothers ask you for something 'outrageous,' do it because it does not matter\" (T-12.III.4:1). Importantly, he qualifies this later by saying, \"I have said that if a brother asks a foolish thing of you to do it. But be certain that this does not mean to do a foolish thing that would hurt either him or you, for what would hurt one will hurt the other\" (T-16.I.6:4-5). The key element in the Course's approach is honesty, which is the second of the ten characteristics of a teacher of God, discussed in the manual for teachers (M-4). Jesus states there that honesty means consistency: \"There is nothing you say that contradicts what you think or do; no thought opposes any other thought ... \" (M-4.II.1). In other words, there is a consistency between your words (form) and your thoughts (content). If we set aside any ego investment in the situation, then only love will flow though us, and it will be expressed in a form that would be appropriate in that specific situation. The emphasis is on the content in our minds. If we are kind within, we will be kind on the outside. Our attention, thus, should be on searching for any unkindness lurking in our thoughts, and asking for help to let that go. Once we have gotten past the unkindness, whatever we say or do will be kind, in a form that is appropriate to the circumstances."

    "text_input": "Q #61: I'm studying special relationships at the moment and I am wondering--if person 'A' feels anger, resentment, hate, etc., towards person 'B', is person 'B' likely to learn these feelings as part of himself, and feeling them, does he project them back onto person 'A' in either a passive or aggressive way? So now person 'B' would then see these same traits or similar ones in person 'A'. If this is so, is this now a circle of destruction? And if person 'B' doesn't project them back onto person 'A', is person 'B' (if he believes them to be true) likely to project them onto his own body? If he does, can this manifest through illness? Can illness then be a form of attack on both ourselves and on those with whom we are involved in special relationships?",
    "output": "Despite what our experience in the world seems to tell us, none of us has the power to cause anyone else to feel guilty or hated or attacked. These perceptions of ourselves are inherent in our own experience whenever we choose to identify with the ego, which seems to be our \"natural\" state until we remember otherwise. So no one else teaches those perceptions to us, no matter how they may act toward us--we have learned them on our own (the basic condition of the ego). That is because the ego thought system is predicated on the belief in our own sin and guilt, which we then try to protect ourselves from by projecting outside of ourselves onto others. The only effect we can have on others is to remind them of what is already present within their own mind. So I can be a reminder to you of your own sin, guilt and fear when I choose the ego as my teacher, or I can be a reminder of the love and forgiveness that are present in both of us when I choose the Holy Spirit as my teacher. But you first make your own choice as to which thought system you will identify with and then my choice can only reinforce the choice you have already made. But if you have made the choice for the ego and I have remembered the Holy Spirit, then I can serve as a reminder to you that there is another choice present in your mind as well. Early in the text, Jesus explains that \"when you project ... [on]to others you imprison them, but only to the extent to which you reinforce errors they have already made. This [their errors] makes them vulnerable to the distortion of others, since their own perception of themselves is distorted\" (T-1.III.5:9-10). So in that sense, we do set up a vicious cycle of attack and counterattack with each other--the \"circle of destruction\" as you call it--that reinforces the perception of guilt in ourselves and each other. But again, the origin of the guilt and its ramifications in my own mind never comes from anyone or anything in the world outside of myself, but only from my own decision. In fact, the only purpose of the world and all the figures in it is to serve as a smokescreen to hide that fact from us. And so then it appears that indeed others are the cause of my concept of myself (T-31.V.5). As for the second part of your question, the guilt over separation in my own mind--which I have chosen--is intolerable and must be projected so that I see it as yours rather than my own. And I can project it either by a direct attack on you with whom I have a special relationship or by an attack on my own body, expressed as some form of illness. And yes, the latter represents an attack not only on myself, but on you as well, as Jesus graphically describes in \"The Picture of Crucifixion\" (T-27.I--\"A sick and suffering you but represents your brother's guilt; the witness that you send lest he forget the injuries he gave, from which you swear he never will escape. This sick and sorry picture you accept, if only it can serve to punish him\" (T-27.I.4:3-4). How do we break out of the seemingly endless circle of attack and counterattack? The solution has nothing to do with the other person and everything to do with a change in our perception of ourselves, within our own mind, with the help of the Holy Spirit. We have to recognize that the sin and guilt we have made real in our own mind as an attack upon ourselves by our belief that we could separate from God has never really happened. As the Course says, \"You will never realize the utter uselessness of attack except by recognizing that your attack on yourself has no effects. For others do react to attack if they perceive it, and if you are trying to attack them you will be unable to avoid interpreting this as reinforcement. The only place you can cancel out all reinforcement is in yourself. For you are always the first point of your attack, and if this has never been, it has no consequences\" (T-12.V.3; italics added)."

    "text_input": "Q #62: I have been A Course in Miracles student for many years, and I am now passing (or so I feel) from the \"beginner stage.\" My question is: Can it be helpful to a student to reflect on positive thoughts rather than entertain the negative thoughts of the ego mind? I realize situations that trouble us should be looked at with Jesus or the Holy Spirit or even God, but it seems to me that the time our minds aren't in the holy instant have to be spent somewhere. I am not talking about affirmations here, but thoughts that have deeply moved us. I will appreciate guidance in this regard.",
    "output": "Our minds are either in the holy instant or with the ego. There are no other options; there is no in between. Our thoughts reflect the choice we have made either to think as the ego thinks, or as the Holy Spirit thinks. The Course would not define these thoughts as positive or negative, it tells us rather that the ego's thoughts reinforce illusion, while the Holy Spirit's thoughts reflect the truth. When we have experiences that deeply move us, they reflect a choice made on the level of the mind to turn away from the ego toward the Holy Spirit, Who is the symbol of God's love in the dream. A beautiful musical work or a sunset can be symbols of the love and peace in our mind when we have chosen the Holy Spirit instead of the ego. What is truly helpful, however, is to be vigilant for the thoughts we think with the ego, to become aware of them, and to recognize their purpose. Since many of the ego's thoughts appear to be \"positive,\" we can easily be fooled. Seemingly positive feelings can be insidious forms of spiritual specialness. The ego also comes up with many ingenious excuses for indulging its thought system and holding on to grievances. This may be what you refer to as \"[entertaining] the negative thoughts of the ego mind.\" It takes a great deal of honesty and patience with ourselves to practice looking carefully at our thoughts without indulging them and without judging them. We do well to stay close to the guidelines the Course offers; \"Your task is not to seek for love (what we may call \"positive\" thoughts), but merely to seek and find all of the barriers within yourself that you have built against it. It is not necessary to seek for what is true, but it is necessary to seek for what is false\" (T-16.IV.6:1-2). If we are honest in our search we will recognize the thoughts we are holding that interfere with our ability to be in the holy instant. It is then our choice to either hold on to these thoughts or let them go in exchange for the Holy Spirit's perception. When we try to be the judge of our thoughts--deciding which ones are positive or which ones are negative--attempting to fill our minds with what we have determined to be \"positive\" thoughts, we will be putting ourselves in charge of the Atonement, leaving little or no room for the Holy Spirit. It is His thoughts we seek, His perception, His judgment. Doing our part faithfully will allow Him to take us to the holy instant. The Course is clear in this regard and very specific: \"The Holy Spirit asks of you but this; bring to Him every secret you have locked away from Him. Open every door to Him, and bid Him enter the darkness and lighten it away. At your request He enters gladly. He brings the light to darkness if you make the darkness open to Him. But what you hide He cannot look upon. He sees for you, and unless you look with Him He cannot see. The vision of Christ is not for Him alone, but for Him with you. Bring, therefore, all your dark and secret thoughts to Him, and look upon them with Him. He holds the light, and you the darkness. They cannot coexist when both of You together look on them. His judgment must prevail, and He will give it to you as you join your perception to His\" (T-14.VII.6). In another passage the Course gives us a very encouraging follow up: \"And if I need a word to help me, He will give it to me. If I need a thought, that will He also give. And if I need but stillness and a tranquil, open mind, these are the gifts I will receive of Him. He is in charge by my request. And He will hear and answer me, because He speaks for God my Father and His holy Son\" (W-pII.361.1:1-5). Our hope lies in our dedication to searching our minds carefully, inviting the Holy Spirit to be our guide, our \"judge\" and our teacher. His perception will then lead us to the holy instant."

    "text_input": "Q #63: We were discussing anger in our study group and it was suggested that to experience anger, we would not \"express\" it outwardly, but instead, as the Course encourages us, be \"Above the Battleground\" (T-23.IV), \"Be lifted up, and from a higher place look down upon it\" (5:1). This certainly sounds better than overtly abusing another with our anger. But what about the idea of yelling into a pillow or hitting a punching bag? Is that still considered attack? What if my anger is so intense that I am unable (unwilling) to \"Be lifted up, and from a higher place look down upon it\"?",
    "output": "Your question suggests a confusion that many students often make in their work with the Course. The Course, like the Holy Spirit, is only concerned with content (thought) and not form (behavior). If I am in conflict and am feeling anger, I am no longer at peace, whether I act on that anger or not. Anger and attack are in the mind and that is where correction is needed. Being disciplined enough not to act out the anger, or to direct it at an inanimate object (such as a pillow or a punching bag) rather than at a person, has certain advantages in that it does not set in motion a possible sequence of overt attack and retaliation at the level of behavior which will almost certainly serve to reinforce the guilt in both your mind and the mind of the person you are attacking back. But the attack is still alive and well in your mind and the problem of the anger will not be resolved until you address it at its source in the mind. This will involve recognizing that your angry feelings and thoughts of attack have nothing to do with the other person at whom those feelings are directed and by whom they seem to have been elicited. To \"be lifted up, and from a higher place look down upon\" your anger is to remember that you are a mind that has a choice whether to look at the conflict with your ego or with the Holy Spirit as your teacher. When you \"look\" with your ego, you will still believe that your angry feelings are somehow justified, that at some level you have been treated unfairly and that your reaction is a reasonable one, even if you choose not to act on it. If that continues to be your perception, no healing has occurred. But when you look with the Holy Spirit, you will come to understand that the problem is not the other person but rather a choice you first made within your own mind to see yourself as separate from love. That choice, as it always does, produces guilt, which you find unbearable. And so the guilt must be projected outside yourself, onto someone else whom you will want to see as treating you unfairly, upon whom the guilt can then rest. And so the feelings of conflict that have come from your own decision to separate in your mind from love then seem to be caused by what this other person has \"done\" to you. And yet if you had not chosen guilt in the first place, their words or actions would have absolutely no effect on you. The fact that they seem to only tells you about your prior decision to turn to your ego and away from love. Once you have accepted this realization and the correction offered by the Holy Spirit--that you are not separate from love and never have been--the guilt vanishes, as well as the anger and the conflict that were its effect, and you no longer need to see someone else as your opponent, deserving of your attack (in self-defense, of course!). By the way, although the Course says that \"anger is never justified\" (T-30.VI.1:1)-- and why that is true should be apparent from what we have just discussed--the Course never says we should not get angry. In fact, much of the Course is addressed at telling us what happens when we do get angry and how it can be corrected, and this is only because Jesus understands that we will continue to become angry and will need the correction he offers us. And sometimes we may be able to put the brakes on acting out our anger and sometimes we may feel compelled to act it out, but the problem--the guilt in our mind--and the solution--recognizing the choice of purpose we have in all of it--remain the same. Rather than denying our anger, Jesus wants us to look at it with him so we can recognize its real source, rather than attempt to justify it based on our mistaken perceptions of our own victimization. Our justifications, quite simply, are always invalid."

    "text_input": "Q #64: Do you think that there are some \"contraindications\" to practice exercises of the workbook year after year, continually? Do you know for example, if Bill or Helen had a specific practice of the 365 exercises constantly?",
    "output": "There may or may not be contraindications. It depends entirely on the purpose of repeating the lessons year after year. There is no right or wrong way to do the workbook, other than to do the lessons in order, as Jesus instructs us. Some people find it helpful to do the lessons over and over, but it is not necessary to do them more than once. It probably is a good idea to go back over them in order to study what they teach, but it is not necessary to do the exercises more than once, unless that is your guidance. Each person is guided individually, as we know. A red flag to be alert to is developing a dependency on the lessons. For example, if you find that you cannot start the day without doing a lesson, or you find yourself empty or depressed if you don't do a lesson every day, year after year, then you know that you have formed a special relationship with the workbook. That is something you would want to look at, because the ego has more than likely jumped in and joined the process, and you will miss the essence of what the lessons are about. Another thing to watch for is the need to keep doing the lessons until you do them perfectly. That, too, would be coming from your ego. It is far more in keeping with the spirit of the workbook, and Jesus' gentle guidance of us, to do the lessons \"badly\" and then forgive yourself for forgetting or falling asleep, or whatever. The middle of Lesson 95 explains that it is much more helpful to approach the lessons that way, because that would reflect the bottom line of what we are learning, which is to remember not to take the \"tiny, mad idea\" seriously. That clearly is the way Jesus would like us to proceed. The training largely involves our getting in touch with our resistance and fear of going ahead with the process of disidentifying with our ego. A little willingness is all that is ever asked. All that is important is that we would want to think of God or Jesus during the day. Remembering to say all of the statements exactly on time each day is not the point. That we would want to, though, is the point, regardless of whether we successfully complete all of the instructions as directed. The content, not the form, is what we should aim at. And the content is the forgiving love of Jesus. Helen and Bill did the lessons together once; then they did them again with Ken Wapnick; and finally Helen, Bill, and Ken did them with Judy Skutch, at her request."

    "text_input": "Q #65: Please describe \"mind,\" the nature of \"mind,\" and the experience of \"mind\".",
    "output": "There is no simple or easily understood definition for mind in the Course, because its meaning depends on the context in which it is used. Also, its true nature is abstract and it exists outside of time and space in all of its meanings, so we will not be fully satisfied with any explanation of it. For we will be attempting to understand mind with a limited (and illusory) part of it--the split mind. And time and space are, in fact, miscreations of the split mind itself, rather than dimensions in which it operates. It may be helpful to point out first that the Course's use of mind is different from the meaning given to mind in almost all other systems of thought, such as Eastern religions, for which mind is only the false ego self, caught in illusions; and various scientific disciplines, such as psychology and neurology, which take a reductionistic view of mind, reducing it to an epiphenomenon, or manifestation, of the physical/chemical/electrical activities of the brain. Even Freud, whose powerful insights into the mind are integrated into the Course's exposition of the ego, accepted its organic origins without question. The most extensive discussion in the Course of the term is found in the first section of the clarification of terms, \"Mind-Spirit\" (C-1). There mind is initially defined as \"the activating agent of spirit, supplying its creative energy ... Spirit is the Thought of God which He created like Himself\" (C-1.1:1,3). But since we cannot conceive of the nature of spirit or God, and creation has nothing to do with form, the definition sheds little light on the meaning of the term. Usually, when the Course refers to mind at this level--our true reality as spirit--the term is capitalized and it refers to either God or Christ, His perfect and wholly unified Son (C-1.1:2). There is little more to be said about mind at this level. Its experience is only of perfect oneness, with no awareness of differences or distinctions of any kind, because they are not real. More can be said, although still not easily understood, when we move to the level of the split or \"individual mind\" (C-1.2:3), which seemed to arise when the Son of God seemed to fall asleep and dream that he could be separate from his Father. This \"part of the mind is entirely illusory and makes only illusions\" (C-1.4:1). At this level, mind experiences \"consciousness, the receptive mechanism\" (C-1.7:3-4), which necessarily implies a separation between perceiver and perceived, part of the illusion. It is only at this level that choice seems to exist, for there can be no choice in our reality as spirit, where, again, no differences or distinctions exist. It is within this illusory split mind that everything we believe is solid and external and real is experienced. The Course distinguishes between two parts of this mind, or two ways of thinking within this mind: Wrong-mindedness represents the choice to listen to the voice of the ego, or false self. Right-mindedness represents the choice to listen to the Voice of the Holy Spirit, the reflection of our true Self or Mind (C-1.5:1-2). Although the Course attempts to make us aware that our true reality is Mind, its teaching is addressed only to the split mind. The Course's purpose is to train our split mind to remember that it contains a choice (C-1.7:1), for it has accepted the ego as its only reality and has forgotten that the ego is only a choice. So the Course helps us to recognize the consequences of a choice for the ego--sin, guilt, fear, pain, loss, and death--and reminds us that there is a different choice--the Holy Spirit--that opens the door to a completely different kind of experience, based on forgiveness--peace, joy and love. Over time, the Course will lead our split minds back to the initial decision point where we made a seemingly irreversible choice for the ego. And now we can make a different choice, removing us from time and space as we become aware of the real world, the totally forgiven world. From here, it is only one final step, \"taken\" by God Himself, which returns us to the wholeness of spirit and the oneness of Mind that we never in reality left (C-1.5:2-4)."

My question is on friendship and extending love to others. I have never been one that worked on relationships. In the past year I have been trying to extend love to my friends but feel in some instances their love is not being reciprocated. I know love is freedom and unconditional, and yet when I reach out to a friend via a phone call or an e-mail and don't hear from them, I'm disappointed. How can I get over this disappointment?",
    "output": "First of all, as a relatively new student to the Course, you need to know that you are doing the best that you can. The Course is a challenging process that takes time to master and it is not easy to undo the thought system of the ego to which we all have been so faithfully committed for nearly all of our time up until now. Your willingness to be taught a different way is all that Jesus is asking of you--and it takes humility to acknowledge that you don't know the way yourself. As you have been finding, the ego's maxim \"Seek but do not find\" (T-16.V.6:5; W-pI.71.4:2; M- 13.5:8) continues to operate in our lives even after we have decided we want another way of relating to others. This is because we still do not understand the purpose for which we made the world and relationships. \"There is a tendency to think the world can offer consolation and escape from problems that its purpose is to keep ... The world was made that problems could not be escaped\" (T-31.IV.1:1; 2:6). And so, as long as we look for any satisfaction in the world and from others, we are setting ourselves up for disappointment. But, contrary to our conscious awareness, this setup in fact is intentional. Our purpose in the world and in our relationships, which we keep hidden from ourselves, is to be disappointed, treated unfairly, and victimized, so that the pain that really comes from our own secret choice for separation now seems to be coming from somebody else's actions, or inaction. In Lesson 76, Jesus speaks of the various ego \"laws\" we have believed we [and others] must obey. These include...the \"laws of friendship, of 'good' relationships and reciprocity\" (W- pI.76.8:3). These seemingly reasonable rules for relationships serve the ego purpose of establishing expectations for how we and others should act in order to be happy, thereby guaranteeing our disappointment and unhappiness when they are violated. Now Jesus does not expect that we will suddenly stop seeking outside of ourselves for love just because he tells us it will not work (e.g., T-29.VII). His purpose in telling us is to help us gradually open our eyes to what we are doing to ourselves so that, over time, we will be more and more willing to make a different choice, to bring our pain and disappointment to him so that he can show us that the answer to what we are looking for is there inside of us, and always has been. We are the ones who have not accepted the love, and have kept pushing it away out of our fear of joining and losing our self in total, limitless love. And we will continue to resist that insight in our practice of the Course and its process of forgiveness. But Jesus does not judge us for that. He knows that we are just afraid, but that in time we will choose his alternative more and more of the time. And then we will come to recognize that our fear that prevented us from experiencing his love is no different from the fear that seems to stop others from reciprocating when we allow his love to be extended through us. And since we know that the love is always ours to experience and share, we will no longer be disappointed when others do not recognize that for themselves. The love will simply continue to extend through us to them, offering them a reminder of the same solution we have learned for ourselves--the love is already present within each of our minds. We need only undo \"the blocks to the awareness of [its] presence\" (T-in.1:7)."

    "text_input": "Q #67: I have a problem in achieving \"right-mindedness.\" During quiet meditation, I can usually think fairly clearly about the metaphysical teachings of the Course and am very much motivated by them. However, once I am back in the illusory dream, I seem to revert quickly to \"wrong mindedness.\" The problem is that the whole world we see seems to be built on \"wrong- mindedness,\" so it is hard to do or think anything here that is right-minded. In fact, achieving \"right mindedness\" often seems to me harder than contemplation of the metaphysics. I know that Jesus, or the Holy Spirit, is always there to help, if we just show a little willingness. I guess I need to keep trying and keep studying. Any suggestions would be appreciated.",
    "output": "It might be helpful to think of right-mindedness as looking at your wrong mind without judgment. You don't have to fight against wrong-mindedness; you just have to look at it without judging yourself for being in that state. If you can look at your wrong mind without judgment, if only briefly, then you have set your ego aside, because the ego would never look without judgment. This is the core of the healing process. You don't have to try to stop the wrong- minded thoughts; just don't get down on yourself for having them. The definition of forgiveness in the workbook helps us keep this in focus: Forgiveness \"is still, and quietly does nothing ... It merely looks, and waits, and judges not\" (W-pII.1.4:1,3). Our focus, therefore, as students, is not on doing right-minded things in the world, nor is it on banishing wrong-minded thoughts. Our focus, rather, is on learning how to look at our egos without judging ourselves, or others, for having an ego. It always seems as if that is not enough, and that we should be doing more than simply looking without judgment. But that would be the ego sneaking in to try to make things more complicated, and to shift our attention from the content of our minds to our behavior in the world. Jesus tells us again and again that we are involved in undoing a thought system that is entirely illusory. In this sense, he says of the miracle that \"it merely looks on devastation, and reminds the mind that what it sees is false\" (W-pII.13.1:3). So thinking in a right-minded way involves looking at the devastation that is our world, but without any sense of judgment or guilt. Practicing this as best we can will result in our gradually becoming less and less identified with our false self, and therefore less and less fearful of the path that is leading us beyond this false self toward accepting Jesus' love as our only reality. Judging ourselves, others, or the world is a defense that keeps our self and the world very real, and Jesus' love at a \"safe distance\" from us. Ultimately, we are responsible only for the teacher with whom we choose to look at the world. If we look at the world through the ego's eyes, we will wind up feeling guilty. If we choose the love of Jesus to be our \"eyes,\" we will not be upset by anything. When we are upset, we need only remind ourselves gently that we have chosen the wrong teacher, and that is not sinful. That is all we need to \"do\" to be right-minded."

    "text_input": "Q #68: What happens to the mind after the demise of the body? Does the mind go home and re- join, although it never left? What happens to the ego? Where can I find this answer in the text?",
    "output": "The answer to your questions lies in understanding the Course's teaching on life and death, contrasted with the ego's version. It is very important to remember that the Course refers to death as the choice in the mind to believe the ego's definition of who we are: sinful, fearful, guilty, separated individuals imprisoned in bodies. This belief is the ego's way of dealing a death blow to our awareness of who we really are as God's innocent Son, and this is what the Course calls \"death.\" When the Course speaks of \"life\" it is always referring to our life in Heaven with God. \"There is no life outside of Heaven\" (T-23.II.19:1). With that in mind there are several passages in the Course that address death, the mind, the body and the ego that are helpful in understanding the points you bring up. 1) The Course tells us the mind is not in the body: \"It (mind) cannot make a body, nor abide within a body\" (W- pI.167.6:3); \"A mind and body cannot both exist. Make no attempt to reconcile the two, for one denies the other can be real. If you are physical, your mind is gone from your self-concept, for it has no place in which it could be really part of you. If you are spirit, then the body must be meaningless to your reality\" (W-pI.96.3:4-7). Therefore there cannot be any change to the condition of the mind due to the demise of the body, nothing happens to it and it does not go anywhere. This is difficult for us to understand because most of us identify with our bodies, but it is essential to understanding the Course's teaching. You are correct in saying that in truth the mind never left its home in Heaven, where it abides in Oneness. Our illusory experience in this dream is the result of a thought in the sleeping mind of the Son, who believes the separation actually occurred. The mind does not return home when the body dies. The mind returns home when it makes a final choice to accept the Atonement and no longer identify with the ego thought system. It thus awakens to the truth that it never left Heaven, never separated from its Source. The ego is also not in the body; it is the thought of separation in the mind which does not change with the death of the body: \"The ego is the part of the mind that believes in division\" (T- 5.V.3:1). The ego is not in the body but does identify with the body. We too identify with the body when we choose the ego thought system, which is why we accept the body's experience of death and believe in its significance. With the ego we see it as \"...the central dream from which all illusions stem ... It is the one fixed, unchangeable belief of the world that all things in it are born only to die. This is regarded as 'the way of nature,' not to be raised to question, but to be accepted as the 'natural' law of life\" (M-27.1:1,4-5). Although the ego does not die with the demise of the body, because it is a thought in the mind, it is obsessed with death; fearing it, seeking it, using it to prove its reality and the reality of the body. It may be helpful to review \"The Attraction of Death\" (T-19.IV-C). Our experience in learning a new identity by questioning our beliefs of who we think we are, freeing ourselves to accept the Holy Spirit's message of who we really are, will enable us to see the death of the body differently and open our minds to a new perception and experience of the life the Course speaks of: \"When your body and your ego and your dreams are gone, you will know that you will last forever. Perhaps you think this is accomplished through death, but nothing is accomplished through death, because death is nothing. Everything is accomplished through life, and life is of the mind and in the mind. The body neither lives nor dies, because it cannot contain you who are life\" (T-6.V-A.1:1-4). The following two questions, although different in form, share a common underlying theme and so will be answered together:"

  {
    "text_input": "Q #69: The following answers are in response to different questions posed by the same person.  : I have been working on forgiving one particular person for quite a while now and I am finally getting there, very, very close to total forgiveness, which should bring me peace. But now I find that I am missing seeing him and talking to him, which is very unpeaceful. This person is not deceased so there is a chance for physical interaction, although highly unlikely because we  are both remarried. I want to be able to act differently with him and show him my unconditional love instead of my fear, which ruined our relationship in the first place. What's going on here? Is my ego still in charge even though I have forgiven him and am finally joyful and not resentful about our relationship? Is missing someone another confirmation of believing in separation? I can't believe I don't have the full peace I was expecting. My missing him has thrown a monkey wrench into this otherwise loving experience, which I guess I don't want to experience alone. I have joined with this brother in my mind and would like to play it out in form. Is this wrong, and if so how can I finally get some peace about it? : Forgiveness is such an important process in the Course, and it can be applied to just about everything in our daily lives. But what happens when someone is murdered and everything abruptly stops for that person. How can that mind process what has happened when it no longer exists as the person who was just murdered? I hope this isn't a stupid question and has some relevancy to the Course.",
    "output": "Forgiveness, central to the Course's teachings, is a very difficult concept for us to grasp while we continue to identify with our ego and with the individual self that we believe we are. Jesus cautions us that \"the world cannot perceive its [forgiveness] meaning, nor provide a guide to teach you its beneficence. There is no thought in all the world that leads to any understanding of the laws it follows, nor the Thought that it reflects. It is as alien to the world as is your own reality\" (W-pI.134.13:1-3). And so it takes great humility to approach the study of the Course, acknowledging that we really do not understand. But in that acknowledgment lies the possibility of real learning. Forgiveness as the Course defines it really has nothing to do with the other person against whom we believe we hold a grievance. But it also has nothing to do with the person we believe we are who seems to be holding the grievance. This is not to deny that we will experience apparent effects of true forgiveness in our external relationships, but that is not really what is happening. To understand what the Course means by forgiveness, we need first to understand the ego's purpose for the world and our relationships. And that purpose is always to see the guilt that is really in our own mind--the original guilt over the thought of separation from God--outside ourselves in someone else. The specifics of my grievance against you are not really important. What is important is that I can blame you for my own unhappiness. Forgiveness then is the process that allows me first to recognize that, yes, I am unhappy, I am not at peace, and you, against whom I have been holding a grievance, have helped me see that. But you are not really the source of my loss of peace and happiness. I am. And so when I withdraw my projection of guilt and blame from you, I can then take the next step with the Holy Spirit and recognize that my own guilt is not real. And peace flows from that recognition. So forgiveness allows me to release myself from the mistaken judgments I first held against myself and then accused you of, because I did not want to accept responsibility for them. And the forgiveness I experience takes place in my mind and has nothing to do either with the self I think I am or with the self I think you are. With this brief explanation in mind, let's turn to the questions that have been raised. What we experience as forgiveness in our relationships with others can certainly reflect the real underlying process that is happening in our mind. As long as we are still identified with our egos, we will interpret the experience of release in our mind in the context of the specific form of our relationship with another person. This is unavoidable while we cling to our false identity as a body. It is a mistake, but it is certainly not a sin. So, if my experience is that I am releasing you from the judgments I have been holding against you, and I am experiencing peace, it can only be a reflection of the fact that I am releasing myself from the guilt and judgments against myself in my own mind. This would have to be fear- inducing to my ego, which survives and thrives on guilt. And so a defense against the love and peace is now needed. For the ego, switching the form of the relationship from special hate to special love is an ideal solution. The form changes, but the underlying content remains hatred and guilt, although now disguised and hidden. And so, rather than seeing you as the direct cause of my unhappiness, I now see you as somehow necessary for my happiness--that I need to be with you to share the experience of peace and joy. But that in effect is the same thing, because if you are not available to me as I would like you to be, then once again you are contributing to my unhappiness. Either way, I am not at peace and my ego has won. The answer at this point would not be to try to change any of this, but simply to recognize what is happening. And then to ask myself, with Jesus or the Holy Spirit as my teacher, is this really what I would have rather than the peace I was experiencing when I was able to release both of us from the chains of guilt and condemnation? If I have uncovered my ego's purpose, it is only a matter of time before I will be willing to make a different choice. But what of the situation where the life of a victim has seemingly been ended by someone else's attack? To repeat what we said earlier, forgiveness, as well as holding grievances, really has nothing to do with the self that I think I am or the self that I think you are. Grievances are held in the mind and the body is not at all necessary for the mind to forgive. The mind has the same choice available to it, whether the body seems to remain alive or not. The projection of guilt onto someone else's body can either continue or the guilt can be withdrawn back to the mind that is its source, where the choice to release the guilt remains the same. Any seeming difference in the process arises only if the choice is to continue to project the guilt, but this difference is on the level of form, not content. The mind then simply finds another lifetime with a different body to identify with--a choice not really that different from what we do within a lifetime when we decide to leave one relationship and move onto another. The cycle of victim-victimizer repeats itself, until the mind is ready to make a different choice and accept complete responsibility for its pain and loss of peace. Murder is always first a thought in the mind, a self-accusation for what we believe we have done to God. We project it outside ourselves onto someone else in order to avoid the consequences we have told ourselves must follow from that choice. But the murder and the subsequent guilt, as well as the world we make as the repository for the guilt we want to escape, are all equally illusory. From this premise, forgiveness follows."

    "text_input": "Q #70: What we see and experience are the forms of the mortal mind. Is it right to think about forms of beauty in nature and art and all lovable things, as the underlying content of divine Mind?",
    "output": "A Course in Miracles actually teaches something different. There is nothing in the world of form that comes from the divine Mind, including the underlying content. This is the strict nondualism that is the core of the metaphysics of the Course. It is uncompromising on this level. The extension of God's Love--known in the Course as creations--has no equivalent in the world. Therefore, to the extent to which we are identified with the world of form, we would not be able to understand what these creations are. The world of form and everything we see and experience--whether beautiful or grotesque, lovable or repulsive--comes from the split mind, the post-separation mind that seems to have broken away from its oneness as a Thought in the Mind of God. This, of course, is all illusory, and is why the very first lesson in the workbook is \"Nothing I see ... means anything\" (W-pI.1) and is followed by \"I have given everything ... all the meaning it has for me\" (W-pI.2). The focus of the teachings and exercises in the Course is the mind rather than the outside world. The training is geared towards having us recognize that our perceptions are directly caused by the choice we make in our minds to identify either with the ego (our wrong mind) or the Holy Spirit (our right mind). Thus, we are taught that the world \"is the witness to your state of mind, the outside picture of an inward condition\" (T-21.in.1:5). This means that if we have chosen the Holy Spirit's thought system of forgiveness to direct our thinking, this will be the content of all our perceptions. Then anything at all could be a source of inspiration to us and remind us of the truth and beauty of God. But this would not be because of some quality inherent in the form itself. A work of art or a beautiful scene in nature could inspire us and lift us out of our finite world only because a choice has already been made in our minds to let go of our investment in seeing separation and limitation as reality. The content of the divine Mind is pure Love, pure oneness, pure formlessness. Within the illusion, within the dream, we can experience the reflection of this in our minds, but again only because we have first denied the denial of truth, which removes the barriers to the awareness of the love that is always present in our minds. The key is to regard everything we perceive as a symbol of either the Holy Spirit or the ego, remembering \"that neither sign nor symbol should be confused with source, for they must stand for something other than themselves\" (T-19.IV-C.11:2)."

    "text_input": "Q #71: I have a \"pattern\" of what seems to happen to me in relationships. I keep seeing the situations end up with me being alone and feeling like something has been taken away from me and that the other person has something I want and need. They get it and I don't.  I have been trying to ask for help in every way I can imagine. I end up seeing my Teacher as torturing me and I am afraid of Him. Lately I have been asking for all the things I want for myself for these other people. It seems to bring some relief but the underlying thought of my Teacher torturing me is still there. How do I trust someone that is torturing me?",
    "output": "It appears that the situation you describe in your relationships is one of being victimized by your partner, a situation that you have projected onto your Teacher. Since you capitalize \"Teacher\" and \"Him\" you must be referring to Jesus or the Holy Spirit. It may be helpful to make this assumption in answering your question. The Course tells us that while our minds are not healed all our relationships are marked with the victim/victimizer theme. This takes the form of feeling needy, unfairly treated, and deprived. We blame others for causing our sense of scarcity. The Course invites us to see the real cause of this so it can be \"undone.\" The real cause of feeling deprived is that we have denied our true identity and taken on an identity as separated individuals, being on our own apart from God. The guilt we feel for having made this choice to identify with the ego is too much to bear, so we project it onto others, including Jesus. We blame them for treating us unfairly. We are then caught in a vicious circle because the guilt is not undone by projecting it. It stays in the mind impelling us to continually find situations and people to project it onto. That is why you notice a pattern in your relationships. We do the same thing over and over hoping for different results. The Course asks us to accept responsibility for the choice we have made. This is the process of undoing that is the real solution to our predicament. Although we may still perceive our partners or Jesus as causing our feelings of victimization, there is a part of our mind that now knows that the feeling comes from within and not outside ourselves. This does dissipate some of the feeling and is the beginning step of the forgiveness process. This is what the Course means when it says \"Be willing to forgive the Son of God for what he did not do\" (T-17.III.1:5). Since we project the same feelings onto Jesus, He is obviously included in the forgiveness process as well. There is another reason why it is normal for students of the Course to feel victimized by Jesus. The ego recognizes that by following His teaching in the Course the underpinnings of its thought system are being pulled out from under it and eventually our identification with it will be relinquished. This can indeed be experienced in a mild form as having something taken away, or in the extreme as \"being tortured.\" The manual describes this process: \"First, they must go through what might be called a 'period of undoing.' This need not be painful, but it usually is so experienced. It seems as if things are being taken away, and it is rarely understood initially that their lack of value is merely being recognized\" (M-4.I.A.3:1-3). The very title of this section, \"The Development of Trust,\" indicates that we are starting from a place of not trusting to be led through a process of developing trust. Our learning process with Jesus as our teacher may be viewed as similar to the healing relationship with a doctor or dentist. When we see a doctor or dentist we know that their help may seem to hurt us but they will treat our illness and eventually we will feel better. In this sense Jesus is our \"doctor\"; he is a teacher who is teaching us a new thought system to heal our sick minds. It seems to hurt because we are so confused and lost in our misperceptions about everything and we are attached to the thoughts of the ego that have actually made our minds sick and in need of healing. It may help to try to relate to Jesus as you would to a kind and loving doctor who is helping in the gentlest way possible. Just as the dentist or doctor would not take groans or complaining personally, neither does Jesus. In fact he expects that we have grievances against him and knows that we are just learning to trust him: \"Forgive me, then, today. And you will know you have forgiven me if you behold your brother in the light of holiness. He cannot be less holy than can I, and you can not be holier than he\" (W-pII.288.2:1-3). Our forgiveness then includes Jesus and all of our brothers. It is the answer to our problem of separation and our feelings of deprivation. In the process it is important not to deny the negative feelings towards Jesus, but not to think they have any effect on his love or his ability to help in spite of our fear or lack of trust. The fact that you ask for help must mean that on some level you do trust him and you do know he can help you. As we learn to see the ego dynamics at work in our relationships and understand their purpose, we learn to be willing to take responsibility for the way we feel and no longer believe the ego's interpretation or projection. It then becomes easier to accept that Jesus is not the cause of our dilemma; rather he is offering us a way out of hell through the teaching of the Course. He is not forcing us or rushing us, but nudges us gently along the path from the ego's dream of darkness to the light of his love: \"How can you wake children in a more kindly way than by a gentle Voice that will not frighten them, but will merely remind them that the night is over and the light has come? You do not inform them that the nightmares that frightened them so badly are not real, because children believe in magic. You merely reassure them that they are safe now. Then you train them to recognize the difference between sleeping and waking, so they will understand they need not be afraid of dreams. And so when bad dreams come, they will themselves call on the light to dispel them\" (T-6.V.2)."

Further in the workbook at the introduction to Section 10 it also states: \"God's Final Judgment is as merciful as every step in His appointed plan to bless His Son, and call him to return to the eternal peace He shares with him. Be not afraid of love. For it alone can heal all sorrow, wipe away all tears, and gently waken from his dream of pain the Son whom God acknowledges as His\" (W-pII.10.4:1-3). This seems to be in conflict with the claim that God is unaware of the physical world. So, why would God need a plan? It would appear from this that God is aware that His Son is sleeping. If not, how can it be so that God would have a plan to \"call him to return\" and to \"gently waken from his dream of pain\" if God is not aware of this need for His Son Whom according to Truth is not sleeping and therefore has no need in Truth to return to the Father? If as the Course states the physical world is an illusion and God is not aware of the illusion what is the need of a plan to awaken the Son? Do these passages not infer that God is in fact aware of that which is not real?",
    "output": "Your question is a very good one. One of the challenging but essential things to understand about the Course is how it uses language. If you can remember that the Course has come only as a correction for the thought of separation--which is very real in our experience--and so must use the symbols of separation to bring about the correction (T-25.I.7:4), everything will begin to become clearer. The ego's myth of separation, which we at a deep unconscious level believe, spins a wild tale of attack and counterattack between the Son and the Father, with the Father in the end seeking to destroy the Son for his malicious attempt to usurp the Father's position of superiority in the Kingdom (e.g., M-17.7). That this story is widely accepted is evident in Christianity's foundational belief that God's plan for our salvation requires His one and only Son to suffer and die an ignominious death in order to atone for our grievous offense against Him, a sin so heinous we ourselves are completely incapable of atoning for it. And Christianity's basic premise is only one specific expression of the ego's underlying myth, predicated on the reality of separation and sin. Parallels can be seen in the other formal religions of the world that emphasize the need for and value of suffering and sacrifice in approaching God. The Course comes as a correction for the ego's false story, but it would hardly be helpful if the correction were nothing more than a statement that none of this is real, since we are convinced otherwise and are still desperately clinging to this sinful self that we believe the separation has made real. And so the Course tells a different story, a story of a loving Father whose plan for our salvation--our happy return to Him--has not a single element of violence or revenge in it, nor exacts any sacrifice or pain from His children. This corrective story of God's plan for our salvation uses the same dualistic symbols of separation as the ego's story, but as a metaphorical rendering rather than a literal account. And so the symbols are infused with a completely different content that reflects the unified Love of Heaven rather than the fragmenting hatred of the ego. The purpose of the Course's correction is to begin to undo some of the guilt and fear that we have made real in our minds so that we can begin to approach the part of our mind where the Holy Spirit--the Correction--resides (even this is metaphorical) as a reflection of the unity and wholeness of our true reality as Christ. (The audio Duality as Metaphor provides a much more extended treatment of this whole issue.)"

    "text_input": "Q #73: Why should I decide against pain?",
    "output": "Because it hurts, and because not to decide against pain keeps us in hell. However, there is really no obligation to decide against pain. As long as pain is tolerable, denied, or temporarily assuaged, it is conceivable that no decision against it will be made. The physical, emotional, and psychological pain experienced in the body is a reflection of the pain in the mind, which is the result of denying our identity as God's one Son by choosing to separate from Him. Pain, therefore, is the condition of the separated Son: \"Pain is the thought of evil taking form, and working havoc in your holy mind. Pain is the ransom you have gladly paid not to be free. In pain is God denied the Son He loves. In pain does fear appear to triumph over love, and time replace eternity and Heaven. And the world becomes a cruel and a bitter place, where sorrow rules and little joys give way before the onslaught of the savage pain that waits to end all joy in misery\" (W-pI.190:8). Why then would we want it? Since we have found numerous ways to adapt to the very painful experience of denying our true Self, and identifying with the ego, our pain often goes unrecognized. This adjustment to pain is compounded by our confusing pain and joy, as the Course tells us: \"You no more recognize what is painful than you know what is joyful, and are, in fact, very apt to confuse the two. The Holy Spirit's main function is to teach you to tell them apart. What is joyful to you is painful to the ego, and as long as you are in doubt about what you are, you will be confused about joy and pain\" (T-7.X.3:4-6). It is when the true depth and searing pain of the ego's thought system is recognized, and becomes intolerable, that steps are taken to decide against it. This is the goal of the Course. Until then, tremendous energy, time, and money are spent in making accommodations to live with the pain of being in this world. The decision against pain is inevitable, because the decision for God is inevitable. We could paraphrase a very familiar line in the Introduction to the text: \"It is a required decision. Only the time you make it is voluntary\" (T-in.1:2-3; italics added). From the moment of birth we seek to alleviate or avoid pain. This is a drive natural to physical bodies. Unless some specific pathology exists, we naturally seek relief from every imaginable physical, psychological, and emotional discomfort, whether we do so consciously or unconsciously. The Holy Spirit makes use of this natural aversion to pain to lead us gently to make another choice, which will end our pain and lead us out of hell. When we have had enough of the pain in our psyches caused by our destructive ego choices, we will be willing to accept His help and find the relief forgiveness offers: \"Do you not then begin to understand what forgiveness will do for you? It will remove all sense of weakness, strain and fatigue from your mind. It will take away all fear and guilt and pain. It will restore the invulnerability and power God gave His Son to your awareness\" (W- pI.62.3:2-5). Being without weakness, strain, fatigue, fear, and guilt would seem to be a convincing enough reason to decide against pain, not to mention the peace that will replace it, whenever we are ready to accept it."

It almost totally preoccupied her, and succeeded in keeping Jesus safely away from her attention. My work and commitments are doing the same for me. Although I never thought I was using them as a defense--only being normal. Can this be avoided?",
    "output": "A major focus of the teaching and training of the Course is to get us to think in terms of purpose. \"What do I want to come of this? What is it for?\" (T-17.VI.2:1-2); \"The test of everything on earth is simply this; 'What is it for?' The answer makes it what it is for you. It has no meaning of itself, yet you can give reality to it, according to the purpose that you serve\" (T- 24.VII.6:1-3). There are only two purposes that are open to choice in our minds. Either we have chosen to reinforce our belief in separation or to undo this belief, and there is never an instant when we are not making this choice. Another way of stating this is that we are always choosing either to push the love of Jesus away, or to join with it. This means that it is never the activity that we are engaged in that is the problem or the reason we are not peaceful, it is the choice we are making to use the activity to keep us separate or in conflict, etc. The Course teaches that we made the world to be a distraction and a smoke screen, so that we would forget entirely that we have a mind that at every instant is choosing to identify with the ego's or with the Holy Spirit's thought system. We become preoccupied with our work, our families, etc., never realizing the underlying purpose that has been chosen in our minds. We justify our immersion in our lives in the world by saying, \"Everyone does that\" or \"It's normal.\" But it is all very purposeful, as reflected in this statement: \"Every special relationship you have made has, as its fundamental purpose, the aim of occupying your mind so completely that you will not hear the call of truth\" (T-17.IV.3:3). We, of course, are not aware that this is going on, which is why the Course is so helpful. In view of this, your question regarding how to avoid using work, or anything else, as a defense against the love of Jesus in a sense is the wrong question, or focus. As the above quote indicates, that is the very purpose of our being in the world with all of our obligations and commitments-- to be preoccupied with what is outside our minds so that we will forget entirely that we have a mind that is choosing at every instant. In that sense, then, we can't avoid using the world as a defense, because that is why we are here! So what would help you most is simply to be honest about this as your underlying intention in being busy. The purpose is not what you think, just as Jesus informs us in Lesson 5 that we are never upset for the reason we think. Helen knew this clearly. She knew that her shopping was a way of keeping Jesus away. If you can be clear about that, the problem will not be worsened by guilt over the dishonesty. Being afraid to get close to love is not sinful, therefore, shame and guilt are not justified. Fear is not a sin, and it has no effect on Jesus' love for you. When Helen knew she was ready to accept Jesus' love, her experience was that he told her she didn't have to go shopping anymore, and there was no sense of sacrifice. She was always clear about the purpose of what she was doing. That is what we all need to aim for. We are never busy for the reason we think! The correction comes when we first recognize the purpose we have chosen in our wrong minds, and then ask Jesus or the Holy Spirit to help us shift our purpose so that we would use everything as a means of undoing the separation and seeing our interests as shared with everyone else's rather than in conflict with them. The challenge is learning how to do both--how to be aware of what is going on in our minds and at the same time conscientiously fulfilling our obligations and responsibilities in the world to the best of our ability. It is possible to do this, but it takes a great deal of practice. That is what the exercises in the workbook are designed to do. We learn how to function in the world effectively, while learning that we are not of the world."

    "text_input": "Q #75: A Course in Miracles speaks of the \"Great Rays.\" Could you explain what are the Great Rays?",
    "output": "The \"Great Rays\" is a term used to refer to the light that radiates from God, extending to Christ, His one Son. Symbolically, a spark of this light is present in the right mind of the separated son. Neither the \"Great Rays\" nor the spark are physical forms of light, but are symbols having nothing to do with the actual seeing of the body's eyes. The term is used to symbolize a reality that is spirit, not physical, in contrast to the ego's identification with the body. When we begin to identify less and less with the ego, we will be more aware of the truth of who we are as God's one Son, not limited to the body. This awareness is a form of seeing, and is symbolized by a spark of light and the \"Great Rays.\" As we learn to \"see\" with the Holy Spirit, we grow from having a tiny suspicion, a spark of awareness that there is a reality beyond what the body's eyes behold, to a clearer realization of the reality of spirit. We \"see\" that there is a light in our minds that reflects the truth, and represents the memory of God, the Oneness we all share. We will ultimately learn to dismiss any ego thought that darkens our awareness. When we do, only the light will be left: \"And from this light will the Great Rays extend back into darkness and forward unto God, to shine away the past and so make room for His eternal Presence, in which everything is radiant in the light\" (T-18.III.8:7). With terms such as this, it is important to remember what the Course says about words: \"Words can be helpful, particularly for the beginner, in helping concentration and facilitating the exclusion, or at least the control, of extraneous thoughts. Let us not forget, however, that words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality\" (M-21.1:8-10). Just as we need to go beyond the symbol to learn the message the Course is giving us through it, we learn to go beyond the body to the light that is in everyone we see. \"As the ego would limit your perception of your brothers to the body, so would the Holy Spirit release your vision and let you see the Great Rays shining from them, so unlimited that they reach to God. It is this shift to vision that is accomplished in the holy instant\" (T-15.IX.1:1-2). This does not necessarily mean that we see actual rays emanating from anyone. It is a shift in our perception that will take place in our mind, when we allow judgment to be replaced by forgiveness in the holy instant."

    "text_input": "Q #76: A number of philosophers and psychologists have noted that Western civilization, in the development of science and the growth of the self into an individual, autonomous ego--the healthy and mature adult ego--has been characterized by an acute split between body and mind (i.e., ego mind--the brain). This division also shows up in the split between man and nature in our civilization. The psychological repression and alienation from nature has produced a lack of vitality, enthusiasm, and zest for living in our culture. Now the Course does not seem to deal with this problem and even appears to increase the alienation by saying the body and the world do not exist. It seems that in order to transcend the ego we will first need to recover much of what was lost. I think the Course is saying that as we look at our egos with the Holy Spirit and practice forgiveness, we begin to heal the repression and alienation. Is this correct? It seems that even if this is correct there is a real danger that people who study the Course will not realize the importance of having a strong, sensitive, alert, healthy body in order to have the vitality to transcend the ego.",
    "output": "There can be no doubt that the experience of the ego thought system, in whatever forms it may be manifested, will be one of profound repression and alienation. These are core elements of its basic premise--the desirability of splitting off from the Whole followed by the denial of responsibility for the decision and its seeming consequences (T-6.II.1-3). And so what you describe as characterizing Western civilization is just one of the many different but inevitable consequences in form of the desire for separation. While the Course does assert the unreality of the body and the world, for the most part our understanding of this will be only intellectual and not experiential until the very end of the journey. And this should not be a student's focus as we attempt to put the Course's principles of forgiveness into practice, or we will risk going even deeper into denial about what is buried in our unconscious mind. It will be much more important that we acknowledge the purpose for which we have made the world and our bodies--to play the roles of victim and victimizer--than that we simply deny that they exist. And so if we practice forgiveness as the Course teaches us--releasing the judgments we have been holding on to, thereby making the differences we have been perceiving between ourselves and everyone and everything else in the world no longer important--we will no longer see our purpose as separate from everyone and everything else. This will inevitably reduce feelings of alienation and isolation between ourselves and all that we have seen as outside of ourselves. And since the body is really neutral in all of this (W-pII.294), our focus need not be on the body but on our thoughts about the body and the purpose for which we choose to use it. That is not to say that while we believe that our body is real and we are so intimately identified with it that we may neglect or abuse it. But our belief in its vulnerability and weakness and need for protection is nothing more than a displacement of our underlying belief about ourselves (our mind), separated from the Whole and identified with the ego. And it is that belief that needs correction and healing."

    "text_input": "Q #77: Why does the Holy Spirit speak so softly? It seems it would be so much easier to follow His guidance if He could shout sometimes.",
    "output": "You join a chorus of many hundreds of Course students fervently pleading with the Holy Spirit to turn up the volume! Unfortunately, or rather fortunately, the problem is on our end, which means it has something to do with a choice we are making, which we can now change. It is the interference we generate that seems to make the Holy Spirit's Voice inaudible, just as radio transmissions often don't come through clearly because of static. There is nothing wrong with the signal. The problem is on the receiving end, not the sending end, Jesus tells us in what seems to be a gentle rebuke: \"What answer that the Holy Spirit gives can reach you, when it is your specialness to which you listen, and which asks and answers? Its tiny answer, soundless in the melody that pours from God to you eternally in loving praise of what you are, is all you listen to. And that vast song of honor and of love for what you are seems silent and unheard before its 'mightiness.' You strain your ears to hear its soundless voice, and yet the Call of God Himself is soundless to you\" (T- 24.II.4:3-6). This is reinforced in the manual when Jesus says, \"only very few can hear God's Voice at all ... \" (M-12.3:3). This is hard to take, yet rather than be discouraged, we can be grateful that at least we know what the problem is, and that we can work hand-in-hand with our loving brother Jesus to restore the communication to full clarity. If we are truly honest with ourselves, we will nod in acknowledgment that his explanation for our not hearing the Holy Spirit is indeed the truth. As we continue to work with the material, it becomes clear that the two requirements Jesus is insistent about are honesty and humility. It is profoundly humbling to run into passage after passage in the Course in which he tells us that we are wrong about everything we think and have thought, and that we are just spiritual children, even referring to us at times as babies (e.g., T- 4.II.5:2). He talks as well about the methods he must use to get through to us, because we have erected so many blockades to truth in our minds. For example, \"How can you teach someone the value of something he has deliberately thrown away?\" (T-4.VI.5:1). And then there are many passages that speak specifically of the \"damage\" we have done to our own minds, one example being: \" ... what you have done to hurt your mind has made it so unnatural that it does not remember what is natural to it\" (T-16.II.3:1). It is just so easy to forget that we are the ones who banished the Holy Spirit from our minds. We conceal this and then wind up thinking that His absence from our awareness somehow has to do with a deficiency on His part, or even with Jesus' instructions. So we are ultimately thrust back to a very humble position, from which all our efforts must proceed. Another important factor to keep in mind is that the Holy Spirit's guidance can come in many different ways. We should not expect it to be only in the form of words specifically telling us what to do. His Presence could very well be felt as an impulse to be kind or compassionate in a given moment. Often His guidance is in the form of an idea that suddenly occurs to us, or something that happens in a dream, or simply while we are talking with a friend. The Holy Spirit's correction of our wrong-minded thinking can come in any number of ways. And finally, we always want to be careful that we have not defined the problem, and then expect the answer to come on terms we ourselves have set. This is an all too common form of interference on our part that makes access to right-minded thinking more difficult. \"Be willing, for an instant, to leave your altars free of what you placed upon them, and what is really there you cannot fail to see [hear]\" (T-21.II.8:1). Jesus has guaranteed that our efforts will meet with success, and in fact they already have. We need only accept this with no reservations and then the Voice for God will be the only Voice we hear."

    "text_input": "Q #78: I recently watched a movie based on a true story of a prisoner in Alcatraz who was put in solitary confinement for over a three year period. In this time, he was in total darkness, had no contact with people, with the exception of \u00bd hour per year, at Christmas, and lived in the most horrendous conditions imaginable. Consequently, he went insane (based of course on what would be considered insanity in the world of illusions). I am having a great deal of trouble with how a person in his situation would apply the Course, with absolutely no contact with people or the outside world. How could he join with his brother? How could he practice forgiveness, or experience miracles? If it were Jesus stuck in there, what would he do? This type of scenario obviously brings up a great deal of fear for me, and I've been pondering this for days. I guess I am trying to figure out, that in even in this most horrific a situation, can one still find the peace of God?",
    "output": "Since the Course teaches that everything occurs in the mind, there is no need for contact with people in order to practice forgiveness: \"...there is no world outside. (T-12.III.6:7). All of our relationships (thoughts) remain within, so we are able to practice forgiveness with those who are seemingly alive, as well as those who are seemingly dead: \"Like you, your brother thinks he is a dream....Think. of him as a mind in which illusions still persist, but as a mind which brother is to you. He is not brother made by what he dreams, nor is his body, 'hero' of the dream, your brother.  Your mind and his are joined in brotherhood\" (T-28.IV.3:1-6). In the section \"Shadows of the Past\" (T-17.III), Jesus explains how we always see people in terms of the past, whether it be things we believe others have done to us or other people, or it be the needs we believed we had, which were not met. In essence, it explains that we don't ever really have a relationship with anyone in the present, since these \"shadows\" are always with us, until they are forgiven. This simply reiterates the teaching that you do not need a physical body present in order to join or forgive. Regarding maintaining one's peace in such an extreme condition as you suggest, while it does seem formidable, it is nonetheless possible in principle. Otherwise, you are saying that the peace of God is limited to certain people, places, or situations. It would be very difficult to be a serious student of A Course in Miracles, practicing your lessons of forgiveness, all the while holding in the back of your mind the nagging doubt: \"What if God abandons me now?\" (Of course the ego would like nothing more than this, but that's another topic!) Throughout history there have been many people who have maintained their peace in the cruelest of circumstances. Many such stories have come out of the concentration camps, like those involving the Ten Boom sisters, Victor Frankl, etc. From the point of view of the Course, all these people had right-minded experiences, wherein someone else's interests where not seen as separate from their own. This is difficult enough to do on a day-to-day basis here and now, let alone in such extreme circumstances. But it has, and can be done."

    "text_input": "Q #79: The relationship I have with my 5 siblings is, for the most part, one of special hate. Our conflicts have been escalating around the care of my mom and the dispersal of her property. I find it easiest simply to disassociate myself from the family and the conflict. This does not give me peace but it does minimize the anxiety. I do know that this is my classroom but I feel like avoiding my family to the point of not attending my mom's funeral when the time comes. My question is: can I work on forgiveness with my siblings while I am choosing to avoid them?",
    "output": "You are wise to recognize that avoiding your siblings does not give you peace or eliminate your anxiety, but only minimizes it. The ego is very clever at offering us ways that seem to reduce the guilt and conflict and fear, through denial or avoidance, so that we never address the problem, thereby assuring that the conflict remains and never is resolved. \"Minimizing fear, but not its undoing, is the ego's constant effort, and is indeed a skill at which it is very ingenious\" (T-11.V.9:2). So it may be becoming apparent to you already that there is no way you can really avoid the conflict, whether or not you are actually in contact or in the physical presence of your siblings. That is because all relationships exist only in the mind and, believe it or not, the real conflict has nothing to do with your siblings. But it has everything to do with what they symbolize for you, because the real conflict also is only within your own mind. And so any changes in your relationships will have to begin first within your mind. Alluding to this process, Jesus observes: \"Everyone makes an ego or a self for himself, which is subject to enormous variation because of its instability. He also makes an ego for everyone else he perceives, which is equally variable. Their interaction is a process that alters both, because they were not made by or with the Unalterable. It is important to realize that this alteration can and does occur as readily when the interaction takes place in the mind as when it involves physical proximity. Thinking about another ego is as effective in changing relative perception as is physical interaction. There could be no better example that the ego is only an idea and not a fact\" (T-4.II:2; italics added). So, yes, you can work on your forgiveness lessons with your siblings without being in contact or around them physically, provided you are not also determined to avoid looking within your own mind at the conflict they represent to you, projected out into the world. Your siblings are providing you with the opportunity to get in touch with the guilt that is buried deep within your own mind that you have not wanted to look at, but have preferred to see outside yourself in others, in this case, your siblings. So once you recognize where the real problem lies, your siblings move from the foreground to the background in the forgiveness process. What then is the next step in the process? Jesus tells us that \"there is a very simple way to find the door to true forgiveness, and perceive it open wide in welcome. When you feel that you are tempted to accuse someone of sin in any form, do not allow your mind to dwell on what you think he did, for that is self-deception. Ask instead, 'Would I accuse myself of doing this?'\" (W- pII.134.9). To uncover the self-accusation, you simply need to identify, at the level of content rather than the specific form of what your siblings may be doing, what you are accusing them of. It will most likely be some aspect of putting their own self-interests above everyone else's, wanting to control or manipulate the situation to make sure that their own needs are met, with no real concern for anyone else. And so you need then to be honest with yourself in acknowledging that you at times operate in exactly the same way, even if you may not be in this particular situation involving your mother. It is then that self-accusation that you will want to bring to Jesus or the Holy Spirit to heal, for Their perception of you will be different from your own. Theirs is a nonjudgmental acceptance that always perceives fear and a call for love in place of attack and sin. When you can share Their perception of yourself, you will release the guilt in your own mind, simultaneously releasing your siblings from the chain of guilt you've been binding them with. Now this release is not likely to be total and complete, once and for all, in a single attempt, for our own fear is too great to accept total release for ourselves. When we let the guilt back in, we will need once again to project it. And siblings with whom we have a long history of grievances make easy targets. And so the forgiveness process with your siblings will be a process that will most likely take time. But at least now you know where the real problem lies."

    "text_input": "Q #80: The more I read the text, and continue to do the lessons, the more I realize that I am God's perfect creation despite what I see with my physical eyes. In the first three chapters in the text, the theme to me is--the only reality is--that I have never been separated from God--it is powerful, simple and it is the truth. I KNOW this. Knowledge does not question. Only the ego does. Is this a type of intellectual experience or a 'real' experience--the former being one disguised by the ego?",
    "output": "Your experience may very well be valid and real, a reflection of the knowledge that is present within all of us as the Christ, God's only Son. And the most useful perspective on the experience (unless you feel you have already transcended any need for the Course and its practice) may be this: If the experience is helpful in deepening your understanding and practice of forgiveness, which is at the core of the Course's teaching and purpose, then you can simply be grateful that you have allowed yourself to be open to it--for that is all that really matters. In other words, if the experience has allowed you to recognize that your interests are not separate from your brothers and that any judgments you have been holding against either your brothers or yourself are without merit or justification, then you have taken a big step forward in your healing process. As the Course says of itself right at the beginning of the text, \"The course does not aim at teaching the meaning of love, for that is beyond what can be taught. It does aim, however, at removing the blocks to the awareness of love's presence, which is your natural inheritance\" (T- in.1:6-7). \"Removing the blocks\" is what forgiveness is all about, and this requires a willingness to look at our ego, in all its self-centered viciousness and guilty deceptions, so that, with Jesus' love beside us, we can then look beyond those blocks to the joyful truth about ourselves and our brothers. If your experience is providing you with a glimpse of the Course's final destination, then hopefully it can enhance your motivation for the means--forgiveness--the Course provides for arriving there. Bon voyage!"

    "text_input": "Q #81: I have read that all relationships are special, and that one can even have a special relationship with the Course itself. I often wonder if I myself have a special relationship with the Course. How can I know if I do or not? And is this really even a \"problem\" I should concern myself with? (One reason I suspect I may have a special relationship with the Course is because I  often think that all the world's problems would be solved if everyone would just read the Course.)",
    "output": "Yes, all relationships are special, and that includes our relationship with the Course. What makes the Course \"special\" is individualized, and varies in form, but it usually involves perceiving the form of the Course as having special power to meet our special needs. Another form the specialness frequently takes for students is feeling \"special,\" and often \"superior\" to believers of other traditional forms of spirituality. This specialness includes the reason you give--that everyone should read the Course. And with that you have answered the first part of your question. As the Course itself tells us in the manual: \"There is a course for every teacher of God. The form of the course varies greatly. So do the particular teaching aids involved ... This is a manual for a special curriculum, intended for teachers of a special form of the universal course. There are many thousands of other forms, all with the same outcome\" (M-1.3:1-3;4:1-2). Our relationship with the Course is no more or less a problem than anything else. It is an opportunity for forgiveness. The ego uses everything for its purpose of separation and judgment, including the Course. All of our relationships, without exception, need to be looked at in the light of the Course's teaching: \"...let us look more closely at the relationships the ego contrives, and let the Holy Spirit judge them truly. For it is certain that if you will look at them, you will offer them gladly to Him. What He can make of them you do not know, but you will become willing to find out, if you are willing first to perceive what you have made of them\" (T-15.VII.5:3-5). It is important to recognize the specialness, being very honest about the specific feelings and judgments involved in it, and see how you are using it to be separate and special. This applies whether the specialness takes the form of love or hate, because seeming special love for the Course is the same as special hate. The specialness with the Course reflects how we perceive other people; the people we \"love\" who follow the Course as we do, and those we \"hate,\" who do not study it as we do, or do not study it at all. Behind the specialness with the Course stand all our brothers, thus is the world divided and our relationships defined to suit our needs. The Course therefore, fits in with everything else in our lives and in our world by reflecting back to us the choice we have made to be separate. Jesus does not ask us to \"love\" the Course, or preach it. He asks us to study it, practice it, and apply its teaching to everything, including the Course itself: \"Teach not that I died in vain. Teach rather that I did not die by demonstrating that I live in you\" (T-11.VI.7:3-4)."

    "text_input": "Q #82: The Course says we are already Home. Then that would mean that we are already in Heaven now. Heaven has no outside or inside. It is everything. Does this mean that this world is in Heaven and Heaven is in this world? Is this similar to the Vedantic statement, Atman is Brahman?",
    "output": "The non-dualism of the Course is an absolute non-dualism that states that reality is infinite, formless, changeless, and eternal; nothing finite or of form is real in any way. That would mean that the finite, physical universe has no reality. It is entirely illusory. There are other non- dualistic systems that place the world within the being of God. These are the different forms of pantheism--both east and west--which give reality to the world, but not as a creation outside God's being. The Course's non-dualism is absolute, giving no reality to finite multiplicity. Thus reality is perfect Oneness, \"nothing outside this Oneness, and nothing else within\" (T-18.VI.1:6). And in stating that \"the world was made as an attack on God\" (W-pII.3.2:1), Jesus makes it clear that the world is not in God nor of God. This is the metaphysical foundation of the startling statement that \"you are at home in God, dreaming of exile but perfectly capable of awakening to reality\" (T-10.I.2:1), and why Jesus asks \"who is the 'you,' who are living in this world?\" (T-4.II.11:8). The entire Course is addressed to a mind outside time and space that has chosen to deny its true Identity as the formless extension of its infinite Source, and \"become\" instead an individualized entity limited by time and space. At the same time, this mind conceals the memory of its true Identity as the one Son of God. Only in a dream or a fantasy could this occur, but not in reality, as the Course teaches. Therefore, we, as we know ourselves in this world, have no reality. All that exists is God and the undifferentiated, eternal, changeless, and perfect extension of His infinite being, a reality having no counterpart in the world, nor can it be understood in this world. \"No one asleep and dreaming in the world remembers his attack upon himself. No one believes there really was a time when he knew nothing of a body, and could never have conceived this world as real. He would have seen at once that these ideas are one illusion, too ridiculous for anything but to be laughed away. How serious they now appear to be! And no one can remember when they would have met with laughter and with disbelief\" (T-27.VIII.5:4-8). Separating from infinity, from totality, is impossible, the Course teaches. God creates only like Himself. Therefore His creations share His being, but without ever being less than He is: \"Yet could God's Son as He created him abide in form or in a world of form?\" (C-2.2:4). In this sense, the Course's teachings are similar to the Vedantic statement, Atman is Brahman, as echoed in another passage: \"What He creates is not apart from Him, and nowhere does the Father end, the Son begin as something separate from Him\" (W-pI.132.12:4)."

    "text_input": "Q #83: Lessons 183, 184 focus on the Name of God. The lessons say it is one word and that it has such power that one should become oblivious to all other words as it will bring great healing even to the world. At the very beginning it suggests the concept of surname--so assume from Jesus Christ that God's surname is Christ. A later lesson says God's Name is Love. I looked at the review lessons but still it doesn't say--basically my question is: What is God's Name?",
    "output": "Lesson 183 \"I call upon God's Name and on my own\" is to be read like beautiful poetry, using words to remind us of what must lie beyond words. When it speaks of God as having a Name, this is not to be taken literally. A careful reading of Lesson 184 \"The Name of God is my inheritance\" makes the figurative nature of Lesson 183 more apparent, as it describes the origin and purpose of names in the ego thought system. And in fact, Lesson 184 asserts quite unequivocally, \"God has no name\" (W-pI.184.12:1). The reality of God and Christ is beyond all words, all names, all symbols, all concepts. These are all the products of consciousness, which perceives dualistically, differentiating between a perceiver and a perceived, a self and an other, which are necessarily predicated on a belief in separation. Lesson 184 explains how names are part of the ego's plan to divide the unity of reality into separate, identifiable, segments--each name assigned to each seemingly separate entity asserts its independent, discrete, and meaningful existence. But these divisions are all illusory (W-pI.184.1-6). Now Jesus knows that separation and its effects are all we understand and so he acknowledges that we will need to continue to use its symbols for a while (W-pI.184.9:1-2; 11:1). But he wants to teach us to recognize their ultimate unreality by having us give words and names a different purpose. So calling upon the Name of God is a symbolic way of expressing the final learning that we are moving towards--\"all things are one, and at this lesson does all learning end. All names are unified; all space is filled with truth's reflection. Every gap is closed, and separation healed\" (W-pI.184.12:2-4). By acknowledging that God's Name is our Name, we are accepting the Correction for all the little names we have given everything in the world, including ourselves, our brothers, and God. And so the one Name is used symbolically to undo all the ego's little names, until we are ready to move beyond all symbols to the reality that is beyond all names."

    "text_input": "Q #84: I have heard it said that in order to remove guilt from our ego mind we must invite the Holy Spirit into everything we do and thereby cleanse the activity from guilt. For example, if we overeat we need to invite the Holy Spirit in every time we eat so that there is no guilt from the activity. It is the guilt that is the overweight not the activity itself. Well what about people who beat their spouse or murder other people? Surely you aren't saying that as long as they remove the guilt from these activities and invite the Holy Spirit into them that they will be absolved of the consequences of that activity? Then how is it that you learn to cease a detrimental activity? I know you cannot ask for help from the Holy Spirit to stop you from doing the activity because God doesn't know eating too many cookies or flying a plane into the World Trade Center. He only knows that his Son is sleeping and He wants him to awaken. Just as an example, how do I stop myself from eating too much or the \"wrong\" foods?",
    "output": "First, it is important to understand what inviting the Holy Spirit in means. If we invite the Holy Spirit into our minds, we are asking to share His perception of everything, and to have His purpose be ours in all that we do. If we truly accept that, then we would not see our interests as separate from anyone else's, we would never try to gain at another's expense, nor would we see sin within ourselves, and so there would be no motivation to attack either ourselves or anyone else. Since our minds would be free of all conflict and guilt, we could not see ourselves as needing anything from others, nor could we see ourselves as victimized by others. There is no unconscious guilt that would get projected onto one's own body or that of another. Given this, it would hardly seem possible that someone sharing the Holy Spirit's perception and purpose would do something violent with the express intent of inflicting pain and causing harm to another or oneself. If we identified with the Holy Spirit's thought system and had no ego at all, it would be impossible to be cruel: \"There is no cruelty in God and none in me,\" as Lesson 170 tells us. In this sense, \"cleansing an activity of guilt,\" means cleansing our minds of guilt by choosing against the ego. Then whatever we do would be loving and kind. It is also helpful to remember that we are all heavily invested in our identities as individuals, and that on an unconscious level, we have equated our existence with sin. It isn't that easy for us, as a result, to exchange our ego identification for the Holy Spirit's. So even though we may think we are inviting Him in, we have so many hidden reservations that we wind up listening largely to our ego, thinking it is the Holy Spirit. After years of experience, however, most of us develop a deeper sensitivity to the strength of our investment in the ego's thought system, and know that if we truly, without reservation, wanted to let go of our ego, we would in an instant. But our fear is too great, and we therefore do it a little at a time, in holy instants. That means that we will be in our wrong minds most of the time, and then the healing process would be focused on looking at our wrong minds without judgment and without guilt. This is another way in which we invite the Holy Spirit in. We look at our ego without judging ourselves or others for having an ego, trusting that when we are less fearful, we will accept the correction. In light of this, it is clear that the Course is not saying that we can do whatever we wish--cruel or not--as long as we don't feel guilty about it. Yes, guilt is always the problem, because guilt makes the error real and always gets projected, which leads to an endless guilt-attack cycle. But that does not translate into a license to do anything one wishes to do, as long as there is no guilt. The guilt is never in the activity; the guilt is in the mind, stemming from the decision to believe, for example, that our interests are best served at another's expense, which leads us to attack others, or in our belief that we deserve to be punished for our sin of separating from God, which leads to self-destructive behavior. The ultimate source of guilt is our belief that we have indeed attacked God by separating from Him, and therefore whenever we perceive separation as real, we are cultivating the breeding place of guilt. So that is where our attention needs to be directed, if we are to become guilt-free. This is a process that goes on in our minds. On the other hand, if we already have done something to harm ourselves or another person, we can then remind ourselves--without rationalizing or justifying what we did--that feeling guilty over it is not helpful or healing: Only fearful people attack, and so I must have been identified with my ego when I attacked, or I would not have been fearful. Being afraid is not sinful, though, and therefore there is no need to feel guilty about what I did. It cost me dearly, because I am not peaceful; but it has had no effect on Jesus' love for me. I know that I cannot attack myself or others and feel his love at the same time: \"You cannot enter God's Presence if you attack His Son\" (T-11.IV.5:6); but I also know that he will not stop loving me because of what I did. I have paid a high price, but that still does not justify feeling guilty. It was a mistake, and one day my fear will be diminished enough that I will be able to accept the correction. That kind of honesty is what heals and keeps us moving in the right direction. Being aware of the price of our attack on ourselves and others would provide the motivation for change as well, although the tolerance for self-inflicted pain varies from individual to individual. We must reach the point, though, where being happy is more valued than being right, before we will ever take that next step. To direct this to your specific issue: If you continually hurt yourself by overeating or by eating the wrong kinds of food, you can at least tell yourself that you know that what you are doing is coming from your ego, because it is hurtful not kind, but that is the best you can do at the moment, and so you are not going to make it worse by judging yourself for it. You can further remind yourself that you must be very fearful of Jesus' love, and so you push it away in the form of this attack on yourself in order to prove that you are not worthy of his love. There would always be a grievance of some sort lurking in the background as well. (Our book and audio, Overeating, go into this topic in detail, if you haven't yet run across them.) The reason we repeat destructive behavior is that we want the outcome it provides. Strangely, as Jesus teaches us in the \"Obstacles to Peace,\" we are attracted to guilt, and so we will keep doing whatever will leave us feeling guilty (T-19.IV-A.i). That is why the Course focuses so heavily on looking within at the thought system of guilt that we have allowed to rule our minds and motivate our behavior. Sometimes, though, the most loving thing one can do is accept behavioral therapy for eating disorders, as a reflection of a decision to be more kind and less cruel to oneself. It is a good starting point. But we must eventually get to the root of problem, if the behavioral change is to last."

    "text_input": "Q #85: In Eastern Advaita/non-dualism there is no room for relationships like Cause-Effect, Father-Son, Creator-Creation. Why then maintain that A Course in Miracles is \"non-dualistic\" in essence? Isn't that confusing?",
    "output": "The Course uses dualistic terms in its teaching only because Jesus knows that the language of separation or duality is all that we can understand right now. Jesus is very clear about his intentions with language in the Course, so to answer your question we are simply going to let the Course speak for itself by providing a few relevant references, which you will find below. The clearest is the following statement: \"Since you believe that you are separate, Heaven presents itself to you as separate, too. Not that it is in truth, but that the link that has been given you to join the truth may reach to you through what you understand. Father and Son and Holy Spirit are as One, as all your brothers join as one in truth. Christ and His Father never have been separate, and Christ abides within your understanding, in the part of you that shares His Father's Will. The Holy Spirit links the other part-the tiny, mad desire to be separate, different and special-to the Christ, to make the oneness clear to what is really one. In this world this is not understood, but can be taught ... It is the Holy Spirit's function to teach you how this oneness is experienced, what you must do that it can be experienced, and where you should go to do it. All this takes note of time and place as if they were discrete, for while you think that part of you is separate, the concept of a Oneness joined as One is meaningless. It is apparent that a mind so split could never be the Teacher of a Oneness which unites all things within Itself. And so What is within this mind, and does unite all things together, must be its Teacher. Yet must It use the language [dualistic] that this mind can understand, in the condition [separation] in which it thinks it is\" (T-25.I.5; 6:4; 7:1-4; italics added). There are many other places where Jesus makes it clear that the Course's metaphysical foundation is non-dualistic, despite the dualistic nature of the language employed. For example, in speaking of the Father and the Son, words which suggest two separate Beings, he says, \"What He [the Father] creates is not apart from Him, and nowhere does the Father end, the Son begin as something separate from Him\" (W-pI.132.12:4). And later in the workbook he says: \"Oneness is simply the idea God is. And in His Being, He encompasses all things. No mind holds anything but Him. We say 'God is,' and then we cease to speak, for in that knowledge words are meaningless. There are no lips to speak them, and no part of mind sufficiently distinct to feel that it is now aware of something not itself. It has united with its Source. And like its Source Itself, it merely is. We cannot speak nor write nor even think of this at all. It comes to every mind when total recognition that its will is God's has been completely given and received completely. It returns the mind into the endless present, where the past and future cannot be conceived. It lies beyond salvation; past all thought of time, forgiveness and the holy face of Christ [which are all dualistic concepts]. The Son of God has merely disappeared into his Father, as his Father has in him. The world has never been at all. Eternity remains a constant state\" (W-pI.169.5-6). And in the context of Cause-Effect relationships, one of the dualistic sets of terms you mention, Jesus begins in seemingly dualistic terms, but then makes its true non-dualistic nature apparent: \"Father, I was created in Your Mind, a holy Thought that never left its home. I am forever Your Effect, and You forever and forever are my Cause. As You created me I have remained. Where You established me I still abide. And all Your attributes abide in me, because it is Your Will to have a Son so like his Cause that Cause and Its Effect are indistinguishable\" (W-pII.326.1:1-5). And so while much of the Course's teachings are presented in dualistic language, it must be understood that their purpose is to lead us past our belief in duality back to the oneness that is our only reality."

    "text_input": "Q #86: If the world is just a projection from our mind, then why can't we just project something different when we want to? Why is it so difficult to change things in our lives?",
    "output": "If we were able to project something different in the world whenever we wanted to, it would mean that we would really know that we are the dreamer of our dream (T-27.VII) and not the dream figure in the world that most of us identify as ourselves (T-27.VIII). The fact that few of us are in touch with the power of our minds is a deliberate choice, a defense against the guilt that we have come to associate with that power. Jesus discusses our fear of the mind early in the text: \"Few appreciate the real power of the mind, and no one remains fully aware of it all the time ... The mind is very powerful ... It is hard to recognize that thought and belief combine into a power surge that can literally move mountains. It appears at first glance that to believe such power about yourself is arrogant, but that is not the real reason you do not believe it. You prefer to believe that your thoughts cannot exert real influence because you are actually afraid of them. This may allay awareness of the guilt, but at the cost of perceiving the mind as impotent\" (T- 2.VI.9:3,5,8-11). The mind that we are not in touch with--and not the self we think we are--is where all the power to make any kind of change resides. In fact, the self we believe we are is just one of the many projections of the mind we are not in touch with. This little self has no power at all--it is merely an effect and not a cause. Furthermore, the real power of the split mind is not the power to project a world of form. That is only a defense against the power of the mind to choose--the choice being between the ego and the Holy Spirit with their very different interpretations of the idea of separation. And it is that decision-making power that we are really afraid to get in touch with, although the ego's separate existence depends upon it: \"The ingeniousness of the ego to preserve itself is enormous, but it stems from the very power of the mind the ego denies ... The ego draws upon the one source that is totally inimical to its existence for its existence. Fearful of perceiving the power of this source, it is forced to depreciate it\" (T-7.VI.3:1,5-6). So to keep that power of choice deeply buried, we accept as real the power of our mind to make up a world as a place to hide in, and then just as quickly hide that power from our awareness as well. For if we really knew, and not just intellectually, that we are the ones who projected the world of form and are responsible for everything we see, the world could no longer serve as the prominent defense against the mind that we made it to be. If we are to be the victim of the world we see, we cannot remember that we are also the maker of that world. Once we remember our own part in making the world, the guilt in the mind over the decision for separation and attack can no longer be hidden. And once our guilt is uncovered, we can look at its unreality with the love of Jesus beside us and we will no longer have any interest in continuing to project it. The Course's whole purpose is to help us remember that we are in fact the dreamer and not the dream figure, so that we can look upon our dreams and decide whether we want to continue dreaming or awaken. But most of us, without really understanding the nature and consequences of the choice to continue the ego's dream, want to continue dreaming--dreaming what we believe would be a better dream with a different form that we think would make us happy. We do not realize that whenever we think we know what we want to happen in the world of form, we must be identified with our ego. Only the ego is concerned at all with form, so that the underlying content of hate and fear remains hidden. With the ego as our teacher, we are interested only in changing the form, thinking that it is the cause of how we feel, ignoring the underlying content, which is the choice for the ego rather than the Holy Spirit. And so, if we are identified with the ego, we have already made guilt and fear real in our mind and need a defense against it, which the world represents. And again, for that defense to work so that we don't look elsewhere for the cause of our suffering, we must forget that we made the world, that we are the dreamer of our dream. So the power to project a different form in the world is not a power we will easily allow ourselves to be in touch with, so vital is its role as an unconscious defense. The goal of the Course is not to make us aware that we are the dreamer of the dream so that we may project different forms into the dream whenever we want. That would serve no truly helpful purpose. The Course's goal is to lead us to turn to a different Teacher to guide us in our dreaming so that, over time, the choices we will make will lead us to awaken. This change in teachers from the ego to the Holy Spirit is beautifully expressed in the following passage: \"Accept the dream He gave instead of yours. It is not difficult to change a dream when once the dreamer has been recognized. Rest in the Holy Spirit, and allow His gentle dreams to take the place of those you dreamed in terror and in fear of death. He brings forgiving dreams, in which the choice is not who is the murderer and who shall be the victim. In the dreams He brings there is no murder and there is no death. The dream of guilt is fading from your sight, although your eyes are closed. A smile has come to lighten up your sleeping face. The sleep is peaceful now, for these are happy dreams\" (T-27.VII.14)."

    "text_input": "Q #87: \"Swear not to die, you holy Son of God!\" Just in case, I did that. But I need do nothing to make truth true. So, this phrase is meant more poetically? Like asking me to make a commitment to truth, going for it?",
    "output": "In this passage (T-29.VI.2:1), Jesus is talking about a promise that we have already made, by virtue of our having identified with the ego thought system. His \"command\" is therefore meant literally. He is telling us that we need to look at and reconsider our attraction to the \"holy\" waxen image of death ... you swore in blood not to desert, as he so movingly describes it at the end of the fourth obstacle to peace (T-19.IV-D.6:3). In other words, we have already pledged our loyalty to the ego thought system, in which death--including ours--is the central reality. We have already taken this oath to believe that God's Son is not as He created Him, invulnerable and eternally present within the Being of His Father. It is part of the bargain we made with the ego, so that our individual, separate identity would be preserved. Here Jesus is asking us to undo that bargain. This passage is often mistakenly understood to mean that Jesus is saying that we can be immortal as human beings--as if the comma were placed after \"Swear,\" thus meaning that we are going to swear that we will never die. But such an interpretation would contradict Jesus' overriding emphasis in the Course about the nature of the body. Why would we want to remain in what is not our home? It would be insane to want to stay in \"the body,\" which \"was not made by love\" (T-18.VI.4:7), and in fact was made \"as a limit on love ... to limit the unlimited\" (T-18.VIII.1:2- 3), and to embody the ego's wish to replace God (W-pI.72.2)."

    "text_input": "Q #88: I keep thinking of the error, the original thought, whatever it was that happened. This is a struggle for me. What could it have been for us to want to escape in fear? How could this happen? If we were created in the likeness of God then why did this error happen? How could we do this? I would think that we couldn't foul up. Everything about this course seems right to me. It is the only thought system that makes any sense, except I keep wondering about this error.  I feel as though I failed, and that makes me harbor self hatred today. Tomorrow I will feel differently as this happens so often, and I usually forget the whole thing in a matter of seconds.",
    "output": "The \"error\" to which you refer is the separation. The simple answer to your question is that the \"error\" did not in fact occur. In the clarification of terms the Course tells us: \"Who asks you to define the ego and explain how it arose can be but he who thinks it real, and seeks by definition to ensure that its illusive nature is concealed behind the words that seem to make it so\" (C-2.2:5). The question, therefore, is actually a statement that implies a belief in the separation. The question cannot truly be answered: \"The ego will demand many answers that this course does not give. It does not recognize as questions the mere form of a question to which an answer is impossible. The ego may ask, 'How did the impossible occur?', 'To what did the impossible happen?', and may ask this in many forms. Yet there is no answer; only an experience. Seek only this, and do not let theology delay you\" (C-in.4). Separation from God is impossible: \"You cannot walk the world apart from God, because you could not be without Him. He is what your life is. Where you are He is. There is one life. That life you share with Him. Nothing can be apart from Him and live\" (W-pI.156.2:4-9). The Course's explanation of how we seem to be in bodies, walking around in a world of physical form, is that we are asleep \"dreaming of exile\" (T-10.I.2:1). This is the only \"explanation\" for a situation that does not really exist, a separation that did not and cannot occur. However, we do seem to be very real in our experience in this dream, just as in our so called sleeping dreams all the characters seem to be real, until we wake up and realize we were only dreaming. The reason we seem to be so real in this dream is that we want the dream to be real. We are actively choosing to identify with the character we call ourselves in the dream, and by doing this we are choosing the seeming separation. Recognizing this choice is very important, and is basic to the Course's teaching, that we have a mind with the power to choose. The only possible explanation for making the choice for separation is our attraction to the initial \"rush\" that goes with the feeling of being independent individuals. But then we become instantly aware of a profound loneliness, which impels us to seek for completion to fill the void caused by the separation. In our insanity we seek outside ourselves: \"No one who comes here but must still have hope, some lingering illusion, or some dream that there is something outside of himself that will bring happiness and peace to him\" (T-29.VII.2:1). This does not make us failures. It does make us badly mistaken. The guilt we feel for making this mistake, is overwhelming, and so we call the mistake a \"sin,\" make it practically unforgivable, and hate ourselves for it. We then project this hatred out on to everyone and everything in the world. To compound our error, we make up a false god, so we can blame him for making such a painful world, and accuse him of trying to punish us for this terrible \"sin.\" We go on and on in this endless cycle; choosing separation, feeling guilty, projecting, blaming, hiding, denying. This keeps the world in operation, makes the error real in our experience, and seems to be happening without any responsibility on our part. It is only when as we become acutely aware of the pain it causes us, and learn, through the Course's teaching, to make the undeniable association between the pain and its source, which is the separation, will we begin to \"choose differently.\" But first we must accept responsibility for the choice. In our insanity, we repeatedly choose the separation, hoping that we can make it work without the pain. The Course is teaching us how wrong we are. Learning to choose differently is our only hope, and the way out of the dream of separation. As we are told in the text: \"Trials are but lessons that you failed to learn presented once again, so where you made a faulty choice before you now can make a better one, and thus escape all pain that what you chose before has brought to you. In every difficulty, all distress, and each perplexity Christ calls to you and gently says, 'My brother, choose again'\" (T-31.VIII.3:1-2)."

    "text_input": "Q #89: The Course says we are not our body. The Christ Self is in us and we are not in a body. The real Self the Christ is in Holiness. Where are we then? Everything is inside but not inside the body then where? Is it the place before I became a body? Where was I before I took a body form? Is that where the Christ and my real Self is? If individual consciousness does not exist there, how does one know the place when he is there? Or is not knowing real knowledge?",
    "output": "We are at a distinct disadvantage in trying to answer these questions, which are everyone's questions. The reason is that we have no way of conceptualizing or understanding what does not have physical (quantifiable) dimensions. And that is precisely what the Christ Self is--beyond time and space entirely. Therefore \"where\" does not apply--\"where\" always has spatial connotations, as do the terms inside and outside. We have no concepts nor a language that can encompass non-physical reality. And to take this one step further, we are trying to understand a realm of reality which we have chosen to banish from our awareness, and/or have changed its true meaning entirely. Moreover, the body (i.e., the brain) was specifically made not to understand (T-18.IX.4-5). So we are really severely \"disabled\" when we start grappling with these issues, and yet they are vitally important to us. Indeed, we can say that the Christ Self is nowhere, which is \"where\" we were before we took bodily form, and we will have no trouble recognizing it when we return because it is not a place, and besides, we never left. Okay, now that you are even more confused, let's see if we can unravel this a bit: We are told that \"to be without a body is to be in our natural state\" (W-pI.72.9:3), but that \"what you have done to hurt your mind has made it so unnatural that it does not remember what is natural to it. And when you are told what is natural, you cannot understand it\" (T-16.II.3:1-2). This is our predicament. We have hurt our minds by denying we have a mind and thinking instead that we are bodies. We continue to do this--although we are not aware that we are making these choices--so that we can keep the separation going. Thus we think physical existence is real, and our true Self is an unknown and distant reality. When we no longer have a need to deny our true Identity as spirit, as Christ, we will simply be what we always have been. We never truly \"became\" a body. We remain decision-making minds simply fantasizing or hallucinating that we are something other than our Christ Self. As a result, there would not be a problem recognizing \"where\" we are when we no longer are \"in\" a body, because we are never \"in\" a body at all. The mind just chooses to think it is a body. Our body is just an idea in the mind, and since \"ideas leave not their source,\" it has no reality outside the mind that thinks it. That is why Jesus concentrates so much on the need to look within our minds with him--so that we would become aware of this thought system, which we have chosen to govern all of our thinking and perception. The following quote nicely expresses some of these points: \"The journey to God is merely the reawakening of the knowledge of where you are always, and what you are forever. It is a journey without distance to a goal that has never changed. Truth can only be experienced. It cannot be described and it cannot be explained. I can make you aware of the conditions of truth, but the experience is of God. Together we can meet its conditions, but truth will dawn upon you of itself\" (T-8.VI.9:6-11). The conditions Jesus is talking about of course pertain to forgiveness, which is why it is the central theme of his teachings. A major effect of practicing forgiveness is that our identification with the body automatically begins to weaken and is replaced by more frequent perceptions of our oneness with each other beyond the body. So as we continue to forgive ourselves and others, we gradually allow back into our awareness what we had been denying by believing we are individuals living in a physical world with separate and competing interests and goals. As we make our way back up the ladder separation led us down (T-28.III.1:2), our identity shifts slowly and the kinds of questions you raise begin to fade and ultimately disappear, because they have come from the perspective of bodily, individualized existence, and that perspective has now shifted."

    "text_input": "Q #90: My questions refer to the section in the text entitled \"I Need Do Nothing.\" It says that a lifetime of contemplation and long periods of meditation aimed at detachment from the body isn't necessary. I've studied the Course for many years and have had moments of great peace doing the lessons or reading the text with an open mind and willingness to listen. I've also studied Buddhist meditation which is aimed not at detachment from the body but at being fully present. You can focus on the breath or on a feeling, and watch your thoughts. If you're doing this with awareness, the thoughts pass and you may get a feeling of spaciousness or at least peace--calm from becoming still. I'm confused because many paragraphs in A Course in Miracles ask us to \"be still,\" \"sit silently,\" sit in silence and be still, and lay all thoughts aside. Is this not at least in part the same thing? Could you explain exactly how the Course wants you to be still? And is there any difference between the two?",
    "output": "The stillness or peace is the same--that experience when we let go of all our thoughts of separation and judgment and the constant chatter of the ego subsides. Where the difference between paths lies is not in the experience itself but in the Course's focus on our resistance to that experience, and therefore the process through which that peace or stillness is attained. The question really is, why do we not experience stillness all of the time? In the workbook lesson, \"I want the peace of God,\" Jesus observes, \"To say these words is nothing. But to mean these words is everything\" (W-pI.185.1:1-2). And he goes on to say, \"To mean you want the peace of God is to renounce all dreams ... The mind which means that all it wants is peace must join with other minds, for that is how peace is obtained\" (W-pI.185.5:1;6:1). And that is the reason for our resistance to the stillness. In that peace, the illusory dream self we believe we really are no longer exists--we have renounced the dream of separation. Our dreams of judgment and attack are what maintain our illusory sense of a separate self, with others outside of that self with whom we seem to be in conflict--the antithesis of peace. And when we \"join with other minds\" by releasing all judgments, our separate self simply vanishes, at least for an instant until our fear of the limitless becomes too great. And so the Course, while speaking of the peace and inviting us in some of the workbook lessons to experience it through quieting our minds and becoming still, really emphasizes the problem of our resistance and asks us to look at that. And the resistance is to be found in all of our projections of guilt and blame for our lack of peace onto others, so that we never see the guilt we are harboring within our own mind that is the real obstacle to peace. As the section you refer to, \"I Need Do Nothing\" points out, \"Your way will be different, not in purpose but in means. A holy relationship is a means of saving time\" (T-18.VII.5:1-2). In other words, the Course process is one of forgiving our special relationships, all the external projections of our internal guilt that keep us in conflict and not at peace. If we really wanted to be still and at peace, we would be. Peace, after all, is our natural inheritance (T-3.VI.10:1-2). But we allow ourselves only brief glimpses of the real peace, as you observe from your own experiences. We don't want to maintain that stillness because of our fear of it. And so the Course leads us on an indirect path to the stillness, focusing on the removal of the barriers we have placed between ourselves and the peace, rather than on a direct approach, such as meditation, which tends to overlook our resistance and its origins."

    "text_input": "Q #91: The following two question are answered together, below.  : I have been watching a TV show called \"Crossing Over\" by John Edward. This fellow appears sincere and loving and able to communicate with the \"dead.\" How does this reconcile with the Course, or in other words how does the Course look at this? Just another illusion?  : Jesus talks about all Life as being part of God, and I can get a sense of that in humans, but what about dogs and cats for instance? They seem to have a soul and if you listen to people like John Edward he says that the people he contacts have old pets with them. Dogs and cats seem to be part of the Son of God. What about \"lower\" animals like a rat? I know that this is probably silly, but I'm curious about your thoughts.",
    "output": "These questions deal with both metaphysical and worldly (dream) levels. From a metaphysical standpoint, Jesus makes the Course's view of communication with the dead perfectly clear in \"The Laws of Chaos\" section: \"There is no life outside of Heaven. Where God created life, there life must be. In any state apart from Heaven life is illusion ... Life not in Heaven is impossible, and what is not in Heaven is not anywhere\" (T-23.II.19:1-3,6). So there is only the illusion of life in this world. Yet we who experience \"life\" in this world grapple daily with the \"hierarchy of illusions\" (T- 23.II.2:3); life, death, animate, inanimate, human, animal, etc. There are people who communicate with the \"dead,\" with the \"living\" (from great distances), foresee the future, see the distant past, etc. These experiences, as well as innumerable others, are possible on this worldly level, or level of the dream, because they reflect the workings of the mind. And since we know the mind is one, then it should not be surprising that people can \"connect\" with each other. Just because we believe that we are separate and independent from everything else in this world does not mean that it is true. And having \"forgotten\" our origin, communicating in a way like John Edward does seems incredible to us. This type of communication however, reflects the property of the mind being one, and is our natural form of communication. So as you can see, there is no difference in communication between \"live\" bodies, \"dead\" bodies, or \"live and dead\" bodies. There are no bodies; only mind. And questions about \"higher\" and \"lower\" are not silly, since we all want to know how the hierarchy of our world fits into the hierarchy of God's world. And that word, \"hierarchy,\" should give us a clue as to the answer. The Course teaches that all forms of life here are the same; i.e., all are our projections of the ego thought of separation from God, and it also teaches that God's world has no hierarchy, no levels, no differences. God, and His One Son, Christ, are totally unified, which is a concept we are unable to understand with a brain that has been made to only understand duality. But we can at least intellectually understand that the thought of separation in the mind is one of content, not form. And so the form that this thought of separation takes-- animate or inanimate, protozoan or mammal--is irrelevant. And finally, remembering that this world is a \"dream,\" you undoubtedly know from your own experience that anything can happen in a dream: \"Does not a world that seems quite real arise in dreams? Yet think what this world is. It is clearly not the world you saw before you slept ... Dreams ... are the best example you could have of how perception can be utilized to substitute illusions for truth. You do not take them seriously on awaking because the fact that reality is so outrageously violated in them becomes apparent. Yet they are a way of looking at the world, and changing it to suit the ego better\" (T-18.II.1:1-3; 2:1- 4)."

    "text_input": "Q #92: I have studied the Course for over 10 years and have done the workbook 2 1/2 times. I realized I did them very much as a ritual the first time. The second time was probably the best, and though I would sometimes fall into a routine/ritual, the awareness of what Jesus was saying really hit home. The third time was many years later. I only made it 1/2 way through before I gave up. The reason I really wanted to try the lessons again is because the text is more theoretical and over the years what I've learned from the practical application of the lessons seems to have lost some of its impact. This is probably normal. What I want to do is apply the Course to my everyday experiences and the workbook did this so well. I have been reading the \"Rules for Decision\" and trying to start my day this way, then remember my purpose for the day when I've lost my peace. This has been wonderful. My question is should the lessons be attempted again or should they just be read and applied as seen fit? What have people said about doing the lessons again?",
    "output": "We addressed part of your question in #64--whether the lessons should be done again. What you are experiencing is quite normal, as you have concluded. And since your practice of the \"Rules for Decision\" material is working for you so well, it makes sense to just stay with that. You just want to be sure that you are not caught in the ego trap of thinking you must apply the Course perfectly, 24 hours a day, or else you are not a good and faithful student. If there is any pressure or any sense of judgment at all, you can be sure that it is not coming from Jesus, and that you have attempted to direct your own process. We all are resistant, or we would not need the Course at all. Looking more closely at your resistance might help put you in touch with the fear that must be present in your mind. Part of us recognizes the implications of our actually learning and fully implementing what the Course is teaching. Part of us knows that we have been wrong about absolutely everything and that absolutely everything about us would change, and that is very, very frightening. Part of us wants to go on, another part is terrified to continue. Once you recognize the connection between your fear and your forgetting to apply the Course, the next step is to forgive yourself. Fear is not a sin. As you know from our answer to #64, the lessons are best practiced by doing them \"poorly\" and then forgiving yourself, as opposed to ritualizing them and focusing on the form rather than the content. The fact that you sincerely want to apply the Course to your everyday experiences is the content, and that is sufficient. The form this takes is not the point. You can then be grateful for having made the choice to undo your belief in the ego thought system, trusting that as your fear lessens, you will experience further shifts in your thinking and in your relationships. Just don't try to evaluate your progress or try too hard to get results as you would define them. Trust the process."

    "text_input": "Q #93: For several years of study I've tried to follow your thoughts about \"looking within with Jesus\" or \"looking through his eyes.\" I was never really able to visualize this occurring. Recently, I've come to accept that \"looking with Jesus\" means the application of his teachings in A Course in Miracles to my ego perceptions. In other words, believing the teachings also means believing and accepting the teacher. This has provided me with a better understanding of what it  means to have Jesus with me. Is this a good way to visualize my relationship with Jesus or should it be something more personal?",
    "output": "The process you describe of applying the teachings of the Course to your ego perceptions is indeed a very appropriate practice of looking with Jesus. Since Jesus is a symbol of the content of the Course, he is present in our minds when its teachings are brought to awareness. This is especially true when we are willing to apply these teachings to our ego perceptions, and question their validity in the light of Jesus' message. Because we identify with our perceptions, this is also a way of relating to Jesus in a very personal way. You have invited him to be with you in the form of the teachings of the Course, which can be symbolized as a lamp shedding new light on our darkened minds: \"I give you the lamp and I will go with you. You will not take this journey alone. I will lead you to your true Father, Who hath need of you, as I have\" (T-11.in.4:5-7)."

    "text_input": "Q #94: The Course alludes to reincarnation. Can you develop this in more detail? I am 67 years old and running out of time to learn forgiveness. I would certainly like to learn it in this lifetime because I'll be darned if I want to go through this world again if I don't have to. I wish we had the option to go poof from this world into the arms of God. I say I want the peace of God but obviously I don't because I don't have the peace of God. So I sometimes wish the option existed for people like me who profess a willingness to change to push a button and just make it happen. Then I could push it and learn forgiveness in spite of my \"good intentions.\" Sometimes I think my whole problem is that instead of being grateful to God for my creation I resented being created because God was more than I. I know that sounds ridiculous but I have to learn otherwise.",
    "output": "So many jerks to forgive, so little time! But that's just your ego speaking--things don't really work as you're supposing. And worrying that you won't learn forgiveness in this lifetime only keeps you trapped that much longer in the illusion of it all. Since forgiveness happens in the mind outside of time and space, it does not depend on time or space for your progress (e.g., T- 15.I.9; T-26.VIII.6:1-5). It depends only on your willingness (in the mind) to practice the lessons of forgiveness as your external world seems to present them to you now, one by one. But to do that, you must understand what forgiveness is and what the purpose of the world is. Resistance to the world only reinforces your belief that the world is real and that it is the source of all the problems that are upsetting you. The Course's goal is not to teach us how to escape the world but rather how to escape the thought system buried in the mind that convinces us that we want and need the world and all its victimizers to be real. The world provides us an excuse to keep our focus outside our mind, blaming others for our loss of peace rather than looking at the guilt in our own mind which is the real cause. The world is quite literally the projection of the guilt hidden in our mind (T-20.VIII.9), so seeking to escape the world only plays into the ego's plan to have us look in the wrong place for the problem and its solution (T-27.IV). And so, since you are not really here in the world even now, it would be more helpful to focus on the choice in your mind right now for the ego than to concern yourself about possible future (or past) lives, for that only serves the ego purpose of avoiding the present moment, the only time in which forgiveness can happen (M-24.5-6). But if you'd like a further discussion of reincarnation as presented in the Course, you may wish to look at #24. Sincere as it may seem, wanting a button to push that would impose forgiveness on your mind is really just a way of trying to avoid responsibility for your present condition, of not looking at the choice you are making right now to be upset and in pain. In truth, forgiveness is the button you could push or select right now, but you don't really want to, and that's what you want to get more in touch with--and why. Your thought about resenting God for being more than you-- what the Course calls the authority problem (T-11.in.2:3)--is the kind of awareness that it would be helpful to develop further, for it is playing out in your life right now in your relationships here, a shadow of the real guilt which is hidden in the recesses of your mind. As an antidote to your impatience with yourself, Jesus' words on forgiveness provide a gentle reminder: \"Forgiveness...is still, and quietly does nothing ... It merely looks, and waits, and judges not\" (W-pII.1.4:1,3)."

    "text_input": "Q #95: I have become more and more confused about life and how to function. Although I have gone through periods like this before, this one has lasted a long time and is quite unsettling. It goes along with knowing that no fantasy or things I hoped for in the world will work to bring happiness. I don't know what I want anymore and have found it hard to know how to be in relationships, my job, making decisions, practicing A Course in Miracles, etc. There is fear involved in this state. I know this is part of the process and perhaps part of letting go of images of myself and what I think is true and an ego ploy to keep me in conflict. Could you please comment on working through this unsettled state and still trying to be normal in the world? Thank you.",
    "output": "Yes, more often than not, the state you describe is a normal part of the process of undoing our mistaken beliefs about ourselves and the world, and in that sense it is positive. In a way, it is not unlike the pain and disorientation of going through withdrawal from an addiction. We have indeed been addicted to our special identities as individuals, and so we can expect considerable discomfort when we make progress in \"dislodging [y]our mind from its fixed position here,\" as Jesus says. But he assures us that \"this will not leave you homeless and without a frame of reference. The period of disorientation, which precedes the actual transition, is far shorter than the time it took to fix your mind so firmly on illusions\" (T-16.VI.8:3-5). This takes a lot of faith and trust. In the manual for teachers, as you probably know, Jesus talks about the stages in the development of trust, describing the fifth stage in particular as \"a period of unsettling\" (M-4.I.A), which may go on for a while. What can be helpful when going through this is to shift the frame of reference for your day-to- day living. Instead of the usual way of thinking about what you want in life and what the world has to offer you, you can approach the circumstances of your daily life as a classroom in which you are going to learn more about undoing what separates you from love. You then can become motivated by a desire to see shared interests instead of separate, competing interests, for example. In other words, what you want is what would shift, as Lesson 129 tells us, \"Beyond this world there is a world I want\" (W-pI.129). You can become a happy learner (T-14.II) eager to learn more about forgiveness and what you are doing and thinking that keeps you feeling separate from the people in your life, because you know that all of that is just a cover for the love that unites you with Jesus and with everyone in your life. Each day then can be seen as an opportunity to recognize more of the ways in which you keep love hidden: you must become aware of what you are choosing before you can choose against it. The focus of your day, in other words, would be the learning that takes place in your mind, and your joy would come more from your experiencing yourself and everyone else as sharing a common journey, rather than from an ego focus and the ego's version of joy, which is always getting our needs met at someone else's expense. This can be done while at the same time focusing on your job and whatever other responsibilities you have in your life. It is like a split consciousness: part of you carries out your responsibilities with care and conscientiousness, and part of you views all of these interactions as a classroom, in which Jesus or the Holy Spirit teaches you how to undo the separation that you have made real and continue to make real. Rather than being discouraged and listless, therefore, you can use this time as an opportunity to shift the whole focus of your life in a way that you have not yet done. All of your practice with the Course has led you to this point, where a new level of functioning and relating is opening up. Many times, this shift of focus can actually make functioning on an everyday level easier, because you no longer are thinking along the line of \"what's in it for me?\" which inevitably results in a great deal of tension and conflict. There is tremendous fear of making this shift, as you say, because the only self you recognize and identify with is fading in importance, and the self that is replacing it is not yet fully apparent to you. Trust in the process is extremely important at this stage, as is gentleness, and giving yourself permission to set the whole thing aside for a while if that would give you a sense of relief. At the very least, you can be assured that you are not going through this alone. At least intellectually you know that within your mind is the reflection of Heaven's Love, supporting you each step along the way. Finally, it should not be overlooked that sometimes psychotherapy or some other form of professional intervention can be helpful in getting through a difficult period. It is never wrong, as we go along in our process, to avail ourselves of the help of a kind and compassionate therapist, and in many cases it can speed things along. It might also serve the purpose of helping us avoid the mistake of skipping steps in our process."

    "text_input": "Q #96: Is praying for others beneficial to them? If so, what is the best and most helpful way to pray for others--ones in difficult times and those in happy times--our loved ones (those here and those who have passed on) and our \"enemies\"--those we know and those we don't know in our community, our country and our world--or should we pray for others at all?",
    "output": "A Course in Miracles does not ask us to pray for others in the usual sense, but rather to release our brothers from all our judgments of them, including the fact that we think they are in need of our prayers. We are told that our only function is forgiveness: \"Salvation of the world depends on you who can forgive. Such is your function here\" (W-pI.186.14:5-6). The prayer the Course calls us to then, is forgiveness: \" ... the only meaningful prayer is for forgiveness, because those who have been forgiven have everything. Once forgiveness has been accepted, prayer in the usual sense becomes utterly meaningless. The prayer for forgiveness is nothing more than a request that you may be able to recognize what you already have\" (T-3.V.6:3-5). What we have, along with everybody else, is the identity God gave us as His innocent Son; an identity that has no opposite. Recognition of this identity in ourselves and in all our brothers, with no exclusion or distinction, is our prayer for them. Only this is truly beneficial to others, as well as to ourselves, and it applies to all persons in all situations. Since all forgiveness is ultimately for ourselves for having misperceived, so all prayer is for ourselves: \"Let it never be forgotten that prayer at any level is always for yourself. If you unite with anyone in prayer, you make him part of you. The enemy is you, as is the Christ. Before it can become holy, then, prayer becomes a choice. You do not choose for another. You can but choose for yourself. Pray truly for your enemies, for herein lies your own salvation. Forgive them for your sins, and you will be forgiven indeed\" (S-1.II.6:1-8). Forgiveness is not only our only function but our only need, and this is true for everyone. This is the prayer we may offer each time we think we see someone \"in need of our prayers\" or in need of anything: \"Let me know this brother as I know myself\" (T-5.in.3:8). When we encounter someone we think is in need of our prayer, our response is first to ask that our perception be corrected to perceive the person truly, so that we can be an example of one who has accepted the Holy Spirit's perception in our own mind. Thus we appeal to the power of the person's mind to choose the corrected perception himself. If we practice with sincerity we will come to know ourselves and everyone as sinless, whole, and healed of all misperceptions. No one could ask for or need anything else."

    "text_input": "Q #97: Why did Jesus use Helen's body as the scribe for A Course in Miracles? Why didn't he come back into the world as a body himself? Once someone is in the real world and lays his body aside, would/could he come back into this world as another body? Would he then remember who he is, and his past lifetimes?",
    "output": "Although your questions make sense from the perspective of the world and the bodily selves we think we are, that is not the perspective from which the Course is coming and these are not the selves the Course is addressing. If you can shift your perspective from the world to the mind and recognize that we are the dreamer of the dream and not the figures in the dream, things may become a little clearer. Jesus is a symbol in our mind of the Atonement--the correction for our delusional thought system of separation, sin and attack. That symbol of love can take many different specific forms in the world, but the various forms, such as the man we call Jesus, \"a separate being, walking by himself, within a body that appeared to hold his self from Self\" (C-5.2:3) are all illusory. The love that Jesus represents takes whatever form can be most helpful to us, caught in believing in a dream of our own making that we've forgotten we have made. There really is no more definite answer as to why the message comes in whatever form it does. We can still speculate--perhaps, because of the specialness that has become associated with the physical being of Jesus in Christianity, obscuring his central message of forgiveness, it is more helpful for us to have the message come to us in the form of a book, so that we do not become so easily distracted by the specific form of the teacher. And Helen was always very clear that she was the scribe and not the source of the material, so that any confusion of her form with the Course's content could be minimized. As to your questions about being in the real world, this is a permanent shift in perspective from the world to the mind, from the dream figure to the dreamer--it has nothing to do with laying the body aside. Once you are in the real world, you know you are not a body, no matter what other minds still identified with the dream may think about you. And so it is not a matter of deciding to come or to go--there is no coming or going but only a different kind of seeing. You may then become a symbol of love in the dream for others who still believe in separation, but you will not be identified with any dream figure and so will be unaffected by anything that happens in the world. You will know that none of it is real. Memory for past lives will have no value for you as you recognize their illusory nature. But if reference to any of those specific forms may be helpful to others in their own process of awakening, then your mind may share the correction using those symbols."

    "text_input": "Q #98: A Course in Miracles seems to be saying very clearly that it is important for the individual reading the book (and each and every Son of God who believes he is separated) to fulfill the Holy Spirit's purpose for the world and time by accepting the Atonement, that is, that the separation never happened, and that the Son of God is one (the Christ) and at home in God the Father.  My question is this: It appears from the above that it will make a difference when \"I\" or \"All\" the Sons of God accept the Atonement. Otherwise why would Jesus and the Holy Spirit and God go through all this trouble of bringing the Course into the dream and working with us daily in our struggle to recognize the truth? So what is that difference?  I realize our real Self never separated from the Father so nothing happened in reality. But still, here is the Course telling us our realization of what the Course teaches is \"required.\" I don't mean this facetiously, but very sincerely: What difference will it all make?",
    "output": "It may appear that Jesus or the Holy Spirit have some investment in our accepting the Course's message, but that is really only a projection of our own ego. The reference to the Course being \"required\" (T-in.1:2) was really intended only as a message for Helen when she was questioning whether she wanted to do what it was asking her to do, even though she in fact knew it was the answer to her and Bill's request for another way. It may also seem that Jesus and the Holy Spirit--God could not be involved because He is beyond all words and symbols, including the specific symbols of the Course (M-21.1:7)--have gone to a lot of trouble to give us the Course and get us to practice it, but that is not in fact the reality. They simply are a presence in our mind that reminds us of the alternative to our ego's thought system (T-5.II.7.1-4), and it is our own split mind that gives form to that reminder, in a way that we can understand and benefit from. For a more detailed discussion of this, you may wish to refer to the section, \"Helen and Jesus: The Illusion and the Reality,\" in Chapter 17 of Absence from Felicity by Kenneth Wapnick. Nevertheless, although there is no pressure or urgency as far as Jesus or the Holy Spirit are concerned to have us follow the Course's teachings--they know nothing here is real even if we don't--your question still calls out for an answer. What difference does it make when we accept the Atonement for ourselves? The only difference is how much time we spend in pain--and that is our choice. As Jesus observes, \"Nothing is ever lost but time, which in the end is meaningless ... Yet since you do believe in it, why should you waste it going nowhere ... it is hard indeed to wander off, alone and miserable, down a road that leads to nothing and that has no purpose\" (T-26.V.2:1,3,6). And so the Course offers us a gentle process for undoing time and its effects, with no demand or insistence about it. Jesus only ever offers us gentle encouragement to look at the consequences of our choice for the ego, describing, in what we may experience as excruciating detail, how we are inflicting pain upon ourselves and how we can make a different choice."

    "text_input": "Q #99: I'm currently dating a man who I've been seeing for about three months. I've known him for 3 \u00bd years and believe that I \"love\" him. The problem is that my feelings for myself include feelings of unworthiness and self-loathing because I'm overweight. I often feel jealous of his female friends even though I trust that they are just friends. I keep expecting this nice man to run away from me so I keep setting up tests where I tell him very negative things about myself and then ask if he still wants to remain with me. What advice would A Course in Miracles give me to help me to heal the pain of low self-worth and to develop a healthy, holy relationship with this person? He is very considerate of me and respectful toward me.",
    "output": "The Course can first of all help you to recognize the real source of any feelings of unworthiness and self-loathing. The cause is not your weight or any other feature or deficiency that you may think makes you less desirable. It also does not have anything to do with what others may think or say about you. All of this, of course, goes totally opposite to what the world tells us. But the world, and our relationships here, are what we have made to keep the real cause of our self-hatred hidden from ourselves. The real source is our belief that we exist on our own, apart from love, because of our decision, buried deep in our unconscious mind, to separate from God, regardless of the cost to Him and to ourselves. We are convinced we are loveless and unlovable because we have chosen against love, which is our reality. But rather than question the premise that we in fact can separate from love, which the Holy Spirit tells us is impossible, we maintain our sense of a separate identity and then proceed to look for love and affirmation of our value from sources outside of ourselves, never remembering that what we want--love--has remained there within us all the time. And so we look to others to give us what we believe is missing in us, which only reinforces our underlying belief that we are lacking and empty to begin with. And once we embark on that search, we are lost, for we have chosen to look everywhere but where we can find love (T-29.VII). There is nothing we can do on our own that will undo our feelings of unworthiness and offer us the love we so desperately desire. But that is in fact the good news, because the truth is there is nothing that we need do to establish our value. \"Your worth is established by God. As long as you dispute this everything you do will be fearful, particularly any situation that lends itself to the belief in superiority and inferiority ... nothing you do or think or wish or make is necessary to establish your worth. This point is not debatable except in delusions\" (T-4.I.7:2-3,6-7). Now Jesus doesn't expect that we will recognize our worth simply because he tells us so. So our relationships become the classrooms in which over time we learn to recognize our worth as the guiltless Son of God. And we learn by recognizing all the ways in which we try to convince ourselves otherwise, with a growing awareness of what we are really up to. We want to see others as holding the key to our happiness so that we don't have to accept responsibility for our own choice to be separate and miserable. The Course provides no specific guidelines on how to make a relationship work in the world's terms. But it does provide a means for healing our perceptions of ourselves and others, no matter what form the relationship takes over time. And so the fear, guilt, shame, and anger that seem almost universal in the special relationships of the world now become the signals to us that there is another way of looking at ourselves and others."

    "text_input": "Q #100: I wonder about the passage T-27.VIII.6:2. I know my ego is quite resourceful and finds ways to delay progress, which is why I have grown to walk over this passage. Now, with all my basic human understanding, the only way to remember not to laugh is that at one time, for some reason, prior to this event, we had also not laughed; for it is not possible for a mind to \"remember\" or to \"re-call\" what has never entered the mind. And at this section, Jesus is not talking about us reliving that instant, hence, creating our world and its constancy. If we understand oneness, perfection, Love, how can something that is not oneness, perfection, Love be remembered? How could it had been part of our existence?",
    "output": "The language of A Course in Miracles can be a stumbling block for many people, which appears to be the case here. In one sense, your analysis of the function of memory is logical, but logical analysis can often get in the way of truly understanding Jesus' message. The Course is not written as would an academic or scholarly treatise, in which precision and consistency in language is essential. While intellectually on a high, sophisticated level--with a clearly recognizable, internally consistent metaphysics--the Course is nonetheless expressed in more of a poetic fashion, where the meanings of words and concepts are permitted to be stretched, and as a result are not always consistent. There are several other instances of seeming inconsistency, in addition to the one you point out. Anticipating this type of question no doubt, Jesus explains in the introduction to the clarification of terms: \"This is not a course in philosophical speculation, nor is it concerned with precise terminology. It is concerned only with Atonement, or the correction of perception ... All terms are potentially controversial, and those who seek controversy will find it. Yet those who seek clarification will find it as well. They must, however, be willing to overlook controversy, recognizing that it is a defense against the truth in the form of a delaying maneuver ... A universal theology is impossible, but a universal experience is not only possible but necessary. It is this experience toward which the course is directed. Here alone consistency becomes possible because here alone uncertainty ends\" (C-in.1:1-2; 2:1-3,5-7). As these passages indicate, the Course does not lend itself to the kind of logical analysis you engaged in, as that is not its purpose. It was not meant to be approached that way, and if it is, one will not get very far with it before being tempted to dismiss it because of the looseness of its language and apparent changes in meaning. What is also helpful is to recognize that the meaning of words is often relative to the point that Jesus is making, or to the essence of what he is teaching in that particular passage, which could differ when he is making some other point. This can be frustrating to readers, without a doubt. On the other hand, though, it is purposeful, in that it forces readers to pay very careful attention to what they are reading in order not to miss the point Jesus is making. Moreover, the Course makes it clear that the human intellect itself is often an impediment in the quest for truth: \"You are still convinced that your understanding is a powerful contribution to the truth, and makes it what it is\" (T-18.IV.7:5). It is a paradox that we must learn, by first using our intellectual powers, that our intellectual powers are a defense against the truth, which goes along with the Holy Spirit directing us to use the world and time as a means of learning that the world and time are illusory. We are just challenged on every single level to examine the premises and the values and expectations we bring to our study of the Course, so that we can identify exactly what we are thinking and doing that keeps love and truth out of our awareness. For some further study of this issue, you might want to consult our audio, Duality As Metaphor in A Course in Miracles and Chapter 2 titled \"The Course's Use of Language\" in Few Choose to Listen, Volume II of The Message of A Course in Miracles."

    "text_input": "Q #101: I would like to know if anyone who has practiced A Course in Miracles has become enlightened. Do you know of anyone who feels/knows that they are in absolute connection with God and therefore, never out of a state of peace?",
    "output": "We don't have any reports of this nature, but that does not mean anything. A truly enlightened person would have no need to let others know of his or her having totally transcended the ego. In fact, that might be a helpful way of evaluating someone's claim to having achieved enlightenment. If such a person goes around announcing it, that is almost a sure sign that there is still some ego left. As the Course portrays the state, there is basically only one characteristic that might stand out, which is that the person would smile more frequently: \"There is a way of living in the world that is not here, although it seems to be. You do not change appearance, though you smile more frequently. Your forehead is serene; your eyes are quiet. And the ones who walk the world as you do recognize their own\" (W-pI.155.1:1-4). There are numerous accounts of students, though, who have experienced significant shifts in their thinking and in their reactions, so that what formerly had \"pushed all their buttons,\" for example, no longer evokes the same reaction. Forgiveness works, in other words, and so that should be the focus of each day. Finally, with reference to someone being in \"absolute connection with God,\" we refer you to the section in the manual, \"Can God Be Reached Directly?\" (M-26). There Jesus tells us: \"Sometimes a teacher of God may have a brief experience of direct union with God. In this world, it is almost impossible that this endure. It can, perhaps, be won after much devotion and dedication, and then be maintained for much of the time on earth. But this is so rare that it cannot be considered a realistic goal. If it happens, so be it. If it does not happen, so be it as well. All worldly states must be illusory. If God were reached directly in sustained awareness, the body would not be long maintained\" (M-26.3:1-8). Thus, direct union with God is not the goal of the Course's curriculum. Reaching a state of peace is its goal, where we rise above the battleground with Jesus and look back down with compassion for everyone. \"This Course will lead to knowledge, but knowledge itself is still beyond the scope of our curriculum. Nor is there any need for us to try to speak of what must forever lie beyond words. It is not for us to dwell on what cannot be attained. There is too much to learn. The readiness for knowledge still must be attained\" (T-18.IX.11:1-2,5-7)."

    "text_input": "Q #102: I am really into self-help books. I have read that psychotherapy and counseling can be helpful for the student of A Course in Miracles because it can help reveal the ego's blocks to the awareness of love's presence. Is this the case for self-help as well? Or do self-help materials hold more potential than formalized counseling to enmesh readers in their own problems?",
    "output": "An advantage of psychotherapy and counseling over self-help books is that there is someone else to observe your ego, hopefully in a non-judgmental way, and point out its dynamics in areas you may be very effectively keeping hidden from yourself. It is usually easier to recognize someone else's defenses rather than our own. But self-help books still can be of value in helping you identify your own maladaptive patterns of behavior and underlying thoughts, if you're willing to be honest with yourself. For any self-improvement tool that you're considering, including therapy, you may want to ask yourself the following questions in evaluating its usefulness: Is this helping me to take more responsibility for my thoughts and feelings and actions or is it reinforcing the ego dynamic of seeing and holding others responsible for my dysfunction and unhappiness (although uncovering a dynamic of blaming others can be an important first step in the healing process if we have not allowed ourselves to be in touch with that before)? Is this likely to help me uncover my hidden motivations or is it more likely to help me keep them buried in an emphasis on changing form, such as behavior and appearance, rather than underlying content, such as thought and purpose (although sometimes an important early step that indicates a willingness to change at a deeper level is to modify maladaptive and destructive behavior, such as addictions)? One of the limitations of nearly every therapeutic approach in the world, regardless of whether it involves a therapist or work on your own, is that its purpose is to make the dream better, rather than to lead you along the path of awakening, which is the Course's goal. And self-help is really about helping make a better ego self. Not that there is anything bad about that, but it won't take you where the Course is leading you and it could end up leading you in the opposite direction. The only truly healing practice is forgiveness, and we may find clever ways to avoid it for as long as we can stand the pain. But in the end, we will find that releasing our judgments to the Help of the only real Therapist is the only way to find the Self we are really looking for."

    "output": "Our creations exist only on the level of spirit. They are not things or beings, and are not part of the illusory world of form. The term is used in the Course to refer to the love that is present in the mind of the Sonship. Our creations are the loving thoughts in the Christ Mind. The term is used as a symbol to help us understand that in truth we are the Father's creation, and like Him we \"create\" by the Thoughts of love that extend throughout the Sonship and return to the Father. They are \"the extensions of our spirit ...as extensions of Christ, our creations are part of the Second Person of the Trinity; creation is ongoing in Heaven, beyond time and space, and independent of the son's lack of awareness of it in the world\" (Glossary-Index for A Course in Miracles, Kenneth Wapnick). When we fully let go of our ego identity, and accept who we really are as God created us, we will know and accept our creations. This occurs outside of the dream, where we are at home in God. That is where we find our creations. The Course uses this beautiful image to encourage us to seek our truth: \"Heaven waits silently, and your creations are holding out their hands to help you cross and welcome them. For it is they you seek. You seek but for your own completion, and it is they who render you complete... Acceptance of your creations is the acceptance of the Oneness of creation, without which you could never be complete\" (T-16.IV.8:1-3,6)."

    "text_input": "Q #104: A question about \"to forgive\" or \"to give over.\" I am studying A Course in Miracles in German, my native tongue, but am also using the English version as a cross reference. An identical semantic problem arises in both German and English. In the text I found three places where Jesus is using \"to give over\" instead of \"to forgive.\" They are T-3.VI.9:1; T-13.VII.6:6 and T-15.IV.4:2.  I have been studying the Course for nearly 10 years and always had a difficulty with \"to forgive\" because the dictionary definition for it is \"to give up,\" while \"to give over\" seems much more to the point particularly when we come to the place where Jesus is asking us to forgive him. This is something I can only understand in the sense that we should give over to him our critical thoughts we have about him. Could you please explain why \"to give over\" is hardly ever used, and \"to forgive\" so frequently?",
    "output": "It is always helpful to remember that the Course has come as a correction--first as a correction for our ego, but then also as a correction for some of the ego's specific expressions, including its distortion within traditional Christianity of Jesus' original message of love and forgiveness. So the Course uses the words of traditional Christianity, such as crucifixion and resurrection, Atonement, miracle and forgiveness, but gives them a different meaning. This reflects the Course's basic approach to all of our special relationships--keeping the same form but providing it a different content, as a reminder that the problem is not the form (in this case, the word) but the ego content we have given it. It is our ego that always focuses on form so that we overlook the content. So it is important to develop an understanding of how Jesus is using these concepts in the Course and not rely on our prior understanding of their meaning or dictionary definitions, which will reflect the meaning our egos have given those terms. In the case of forgiveness, the ego has told us that to forgive means to give up our need to right the wrongs of others through punishing them or extracting some kind of payment from them, all the time holding on to the reality of their transgressions, or sins. Contrast this with the Course's use of the term: \"Forgiveness recognizes what you thought your brother did to you has not occurred. It does not pardon sins and make them real. It sees there was no sin. And in that view are all your sins forgiven. What is sin, except a false idea about God's Son? Forgiveness merely sees its falsity, and therefore lets it go\" (W-pII.1.1-6; italics added). In the Course's use of the word, we are not really talking about anyone else when we are speaking of forgiveness. We are speaking of releasing ourselves from the very same judgments that we had projected on to our brothers, including Jesus, believing that we had relieved ourselves of that burden of guilt by placing it on them. The Course teaches us that blame can not be gotten rid of by seeing it elsewhere (T-11.IV.5:3). It must be undone at its source, in our own mind. And that involves simply a letting go, a releasing, a giving over, or a giving up, to the light of forgiveness, in which the unreality of sin and guilt becomes apparent."

    "text_input": "Q #105: What is the best method to study A Course in Miracles? In my experience, study groups bear little resemblance in content to what is expressed by the Foundation, so I do the work alone. Should the text be read first, before beginning the workbook, or hand in hand? If I begin the workbook and miss several days or weeks, do I need to begin again or pick up where I left off? Does it matter? I would prefer to work with other people, but most of them I've spoken to aren't even aware of the non-dualistic nature of the Course. I find when I try to explain that aspect, generally people are not willing to hear it and try to convince me that I have it wrong. Also I've heard people say they like the Course because they can combine it easily with their other spiritual practice. I find it nearly impossible to do that and have moved away from spiritual teachings I used to hold dear. I'm beginning to wonder if I'm the one who is confused. Please advise.",
    "output": "(1) In keeping with the actual theory of the Course, there actually is no best method for studying it. It in essence is a curriculum undertaken by the student under the guidance of the Holy Spirit or Jesus. The \"training is always highly individualized\" (M-9.1:5). Jesus advises us to study the text very carefully and not proceed too quickly lest we plunge unnecessarily into overwhelming fear (T-I.VII.4-5), and he also explains that the \"theoretical foundation....the text provides is necessary as a framework to make the exercises in this workbook meaningful\" (W- in.1:1), so he clearly expects his students to spend time with the text at some point in their process. But he does not say which should be done first. So if you are comfortable studying the text while you are doing the lessons, that is what you should do. He also tells us not to do more than one workbook lesson a day (W-in.2:6). The middle of Lesson 95 might be helpful in answering your question about what to do if you miss several days or weeks in your practice of the lessons. The instruction there focuses on recognizing the ways in which the ego creeps into the process, and that we ought to respond to \"our lapses in diligence, and our failures to follow the instructions for practicing the day's idea\" with forgiveness (W- pI.95.8:3). That is the key. Jesus does not keep track of how punctual we are in following his instructions for the day; his interest is only in helping us train our minds to think more and more in terms of forgiveness. It makes the most sense, though, to pick up where you left off, rather than begin all over again. (2) The Course says nothing about groups. Some people find it helpful to study with others; some do not. It depends entirely on the preference of the individual. In our experience, it is more common than uncommon that people find the uncompromising nature of the Course's non- dualism intolerable and fear provoking, which then causes them to dilute its message to make it say something that it does not, or to mix it with other systems, thereby doing justice to neither. One of the Course's strengths is the manner in which it integrates a metaphysics of non-dualism with living in the world. This is quite a challenge, but the Course gives us all the support we need in our journey back to our home in Heaven, the state of perfect Oneness."

    "text_input": "Q #106: Over the past five years I have been studying A Course in Miracles in unison with my study of the ethics of Nonviolence as taught by Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Cesar Chavez. I had at one time considered the two philosophies--A Course in Miracles and Nonviolence--to be almost identical in aim (this appraisal of mine was aided by the fact that even some authors have mentioned the similarities of the philosophies). Both paths teach that everyone is connected, that we are not victims, and that we should be gentle with one another. But lately I am considering that the two paths may be quite different in emphasis.",
    "output": "If we focus on the religious or spiritual foundation of Mahatma Gandhi's ideas on nonviolence, based on some of the highest teachings of Hinduism, there are many striking parallels with the teachings of A Course in Miracles. Ideas shared in common, for example, include viewing the world as an illusion or a dream, seeing the nature of reality as one so that separation and separate interests are not real, and focusing on internal decision-making about one's intention rather than on external outcome. But these religious underpinnings of Gandhi's ideas on nonviolence are generally not the focus of most studies of his contributions to the field. And Martin Luther King and Cesar Chavez grounded their philosophy and practice of nonviolence in a more traditional Christian perspective that views the world and its inhabitants as created by God, a significantly different assumption from the Course's basic premise that \"the world was made as an attack on God\" (W-pII.3.2:1). With this premise, we see the Course departing significantly as well from the Hindu teachings guiding Gandhi. The study and practice of nonviolence, as a philosophy for action and for political and economic change, often then becomes concerned with outcome in the world. The Course, in contrast, encourages us to choose to change our mind about the world rather than seeking to change the world itself (T-21.in.1:7). If we look at gentleness and defenselessness, two of what the Course identifies in the manual as characteristics of an advanced teacher of God, they certainly share something in common with what is meant by nonviolence. But a careful reading of the Course's discussion of both traits (M-4.IV,VI) makes it apparent that the emphasis is on thought or state of mind and not behavior, and the only outcome of concern is in the mind--there is no investment in the outcome in the world. Changes may or may not follow in the world, but they are irrelevant to the goal of inner peace, which can be attained irrespective of external circumstances. So, as you remark in your question, there is simply a different emphasis with the Course and with nonviolence. That is not to say that one is any better than the other, for in fact the spirituality from which they both spring is quite similar. But the Course is not concerned with how we act in the world. Nevertheless, when we act in the world, guided by the principles of A Course in Miracles, our actions may be very similar to the actions of those guided by nonviolent principles. It is the emphasis that is different."

    "text_input": "Q #107: I have a question regarding the idea: \"It is impossible that anything be lost, if what you have is what you are\" (T-26.VII.11:4). This statement is in the context of describing our true Identity. Is this also true of our experiences as an ego? My work environment brings out a lot of my guilt, either projecting onto others or internalizing it. I can think of many times when an idea I have is challenged and I become very offended, hurt, angry, etc. It seems I have become that idea, that it represents me. So, is this the same idea, meaning, what I have is my decision to  choose the ego so that is what I am? I become or reflect what I choose? Therefore, if I could step back and look with Jesus at these work situations and choose vision then I would become that vision? Is that right?",
    "output": "Yes, you are on the right track with this. Each step in our descent from the state of oneness entailed a choice, then becoming what we chose, but denying that we chose it. The goal right from the beginning was to acquire and maintain our individuality but not to take responsibility for it. Therefore the prevailing experience of human existence is victimization, which reinforces the internal belief, \"I am not responsible.\" Considering only our ego-identification, not our right minds, our lives here cannot be anything other than one experience after another of feeling offended, angry, resentful, fearful, shameful, etc., because the world is nothing but our thoughts of sin, guilt, and fear projected outward, \"the outside picture of an inward condition\" (T- 21.in.1:5). We need to take things personally, otherwise we cannot hold others responsible for our condition. We have become the thought system of the ego, in other words; and so learning forgiveness would be initially perceived as tremendously threatening. That is why what the Course calls forgiveness-to-destroy is the commonly accepted version of forgiveness in the world. Sin has been made real and there is still a separation between the forgiver and the forgiven, directly antithetical to what the Course teaches. The lessons in the workbook emphasize over and over the importance of stepping back and looking with Jesus at what we are doing and thinking. We need the help of a teacher who is outside the thought system with which we have identified so thoroughly, otherwise we would have no way of getting beyond it. So you are quite correct in concluding that looking with Jesus, and choosing against the ego would automatically give you the same vision as Jesus. The key is remembering that we always have a choice; the ego's efforts are directed towards keeping us mindless. Who we truly are, God's one Son, has never changed, and has never been affected by the dream of separation. We need only deny our denial of that truth (T-12.II.1:5), and then what we have made invisible will once again, through our joining with Jesus or the Holy Spirit, be all that we see (T-12.VIII.3). In the words of a lovely prayer, \"I have nothing, I want nothing, I am nothing but the love of Jesus.\""

    "text_input": "Q #108: As I continue to study A Course in Miracles, I am beginning to understand that the emotion that is commonly called \"love\" in this world is not at all the same as the \"love\" referred to in the Course. In fact, I have discovered that in many cases, my ego uses the idea of \"love\" to cover up a lot of very dysfunctional thinking and behavior. What is the relationship between love as we understand it in the world, and love as expressed in the Course, and how can we use that to guide our lives?",
    "output": "The distinction you make between the \"love\" the Course is referring to and what is called \"love\" in this world is correct. They are not the same thing. The love of this world is always what the Course calls \"special love,\" and it is the foundation of the \"special relationship.\" It not only has properties that are in direct opposition to the love the Course refers to, it is actually a mask for hatred: \"It is in the special relationship, born of the hidden wish for special love from God, that the ego's hatred triumphs. For the special relationship is the renunciation of the Love of God, and the attempt to secure for the self the specialness that He denied\" (T-16.V.4:1-2). We are secretly saying to anyone or anything we have a special love relationship with: \"God did not love me with the specialness I want, so I will use you to get the special love I think I cannot live without.\" What we call \"love,\" therefore, is our substitute for God's love. Furthermore, the Course tells us it is hate: \"...any brother with whom you have a limited relationship, you hate\" (T-21.III.1:3). This \"hate\" is based on the misperception that we are different, incomplete, and needy. In the special love relationship an agreement is made for mutual needs to be met, and thus we seek to fill the void left by our seeming separation from God. And, true to the ego's mandate \"Seek but do not find\" (T-16.V.6:5), this substitute for God's love will never satisfy our need, no matter how we try to make it work. Even the most fulfilling \"love\" relationship will eventually end in death. What the Course is inviting us to do is to look at our special love relationships from this new perspective, as shocking as it may seem to be, so that we will become willing to open ourselves to a new purpose, and a new interpretation: \"A holy relationship starts from a different premise. Each one has looked within and seen no lack. Accepting his completion, he would extend it by joining with another, whole as himself. He sees no difference between these selves, for differences are only of the body. Therefore, he looks on nothing he would take. He denies not his own reality because it is the truth\" (T-22.in.3:1-6). The important thing to remember is that it is normal, not sinful, to have special relationships, and they will not be taken away. In fact, they can be useful in our lives if we give them to the Holy Spirit to be transformed into holy relationships: \"I have said repeatedly that the Holy Spirit would not deprive you of your special relationships, but would transform them\" (T-17.IV.2:3). In this way, the love we experience with another person becomes a reflection of the love of God in the dream, not a substitute for it."

    "text_input": "Q #109: My question is about the mind. My understanding is that we are spirit, mind, and body, and that the body is not real, and is a product of the mind. Mind, as I understand it, has the function to create and to let our spirit (or soul) come to know itself experientially, which is the ultimate goal of all spiritual development. The mind mediates experience between the body and the soul, but it has become confused because of our experiences living in the world, and so it must learn to remember who it is--which is the Atonement--by being re-educated. In that way, the soul, having experienced itself in the physical realm, mediated by the mind, can reunite with God and integrate back the experiential knowledge of what it means to be perfect. But if this is the case, why is the mind needed at all? Why can't the soul control the body in order to gain all the experience it needs, bypassing any need for the mind?",
    "output": "Your question suggests that you are attempting to blend some of the teachings of the Course with teachings from other spiritual paths with which the Course is not really compatible. So, to clarify, we will look at what the Course says, in light of your question, including a consideration of how it uses its terms, different from other paths, and what it says about the purpose of the mind and the body. The Course sees only spirit, or soul, as real (preferring to use the term spirit rather than soul) (C- 1.3). Mind has several different levels of meaning in the Course (for a more in-depth discussion of mind, you may wish to look at #65). Mind, when it is capitalized, refers to either God or Christ, His One Son (C-1.1:2), and in this sense is really equivalent to spirit. When lower case, mind refers to the split mind of the Son (C-1.2:1-3) after he has seemingly fallen asleep and is dreaming a dream of separation, believing that he has split off or separated from God, thereby attacking Him. This mind is illusory and has no reality outside of our mistaken belief in it, and it is the birthplace of sin, guilt, and fear. As a defense against this made-up guilt and fear in the mind over the attack upon God, the split mind under the guidance of the ego then makes up a body to hide in and a world outside of itself onto which all the attack and guilt in the mind can be displaced. Again, none of this is real, according to the Course. But we believe in it because we want the separation to be real but we do not want to be responsible for it. The Course sees no positive or Divine purpose in the thought of separation that has led to the split mind and its defense, the body and the world. And so any experience that comes from them has no value in itself. The Course does make further distinctions within the split mind and it is through an understanding of these that we can see how the body and our experiences in the world can come to serve a useful purpose. But the purpose again is not to do anything positive but rather to undo the negative by allowing all of our errors or mistaken beliefs about ourselves to be corrected. The Course calls this process forgiveness. The split mind is home not only to the ego, the wrong-minded aspect of the post-separation self, but also to the Holy Spirit, who remembers our reality as God's One, true Son, and so is able to correct all of our mistaken beliefs about who we are and what the world is (C-1.5-6). Basically, He reminds us that the separation never happened and that we never attacked God--which is what the Course means by the Atonement principle (M-2.2:2-3). And so, as the seemingly separated Son, we have a choice as to whether we are going to listen to the harsh and strident lies of the ego, which can only take us deeper into the morass of sin and guilt, or to the gentle corrections of the Holy Spirit. His corrections allow us to undo our mistaken beliefs about who we are and return to the Home we never left. For this process of undoing to happen, we have to pay attention to our experiences as a body in the world, becoming aware of what interpretations we are giving to those experiences--usually some variation on seeing ourselves as victims and others as victimizers so that the guilt resides outside ourselves. And so it is in this sense that the Course would say that our experiences are of value. For we can then bring these mistaken thoughts to the Holy Spirit for correction. The only real purpose for the world and our body then is to teach us that they are not what we have believed them to be. When we let go of those false beliefs, we then remember Who we really are as the Christ, whose reality as spirit has never changed at all, being as changelessly perfect as our Source. At that point, the body, the world, and the split mind have simply disappeared, as darkness disappears when light shines upon it, for they have no reality."

    "text_input": "Q #110: It was in this site that I read about \"Jesus\" saying or teaching this or that in the A Course in Miracles for the first time. Is his name mentioned in the Course at any point and if not, how did you start using his name that otherwise would be \"the Christic voice,\" \"the Christ,\" or something like that?",
    "output": "Jesus is mentioned in the Course; in the manual for teachers (M-23) and the clarification of terms (C-5). These more lengthy passages may completely answer your question. Also, in the text there are several first person passages (notably T-1.II.3-4) which refer to Jesus, although his name is not mentioned. Helen Schucman knew the inner voice she heard was that of Jesus, just as we know the voice of a family member on the phone without asking: \"Helen incidentally was well aware ...that the Voice belonged to Jesus...\" (Absence from Felicity, Kenneth Wapnick, p. 179). It is important to remember, however, that in the dream Jesus is a symbol for one who has fully identified with the Christ, and that this identity is not exclusive to Jesus. On the other hand, the term Christ, as used in the Course, refers to the \"totality of the Sonship\" as defined in the Glossary-Index for A Course in Miracles by Kenneth Wapnick. Christ, the Second Person of the Trinity, remains at one with the Father in Heaven, and is not present in the dream. It would, therefore, not be appropriate to refer to Christ as the messenger or \"voice\" of the Course. Belief that Jesus is the voice who speaks in A Course in Miracles is not necessary to our work with it. Nor is it necessary to develop a relationship with him, but it is helpful. As a symbol in our dream, Jesus is with us to teach us to do as he did in accepting the Atonement: \"Jesus has led the way... This course has come from him because his words have reached you in a language you can love and understand. Are other teachers possible, to lead the way to those who speak in different tongues and appeal to different symbols? Certainly there are. Would God leave anyone without a very present help in time of trouble; a savior who can symbolize Himself?... Jesus has come to answer yours. In him you find God's Answer. Do you, then, teach with him, for he is with you; he is always here\" (M-23.5:1; 7:1-4,6-8). The course is a very loving message that comes to us from the memory of God's love reflected in the mind symbolized in the \"person\" of Jesus. The form this love takes is not important, it is only important that we hear the message and accept the love. Hearing Jesus speak the words of the Course to you as you study is a very helpful way, not only to relate to Jesus, but to accept the love the Course reflects."

    "output": "The entire physical universe is an illusion, not just our interpretations. This is the absolute non-dualism of the Course's metaphysics. The Course is clear that what is real is changeless, without limit, formless, perfect, and eternal. Therefore anything that changes, that is limited, that has form, that is not perfect, and that is temporal cannot be real. Some passages to look at are the following, although there are many, many others that speak of non-dualism: Lesson 132: \"There is no world! This is the central thought the course attempts to teach\" (W- pI.132.6:2-3); as well as other parts of the lesson. \"True Perception--Knowledge\": In this section in the clarification of terms, Jesus uses the phrase \"the world you see\"; but what follows makes it quite clear that he is referring not to our interpretations, but to the entire physical world that our eyes look upon. \"The world you see is an illusion of a world. God did not create it, for what He creates must be eternal as Himself. Yet there is nothing in the world you see that will endure forever. Some things will last in time a little while longer than others. But the time will come when all things visible will have an end\" (C- 4.1). \"Forgiveness and the End of Time\" (T-29.VI). This entire section describes anything of time and change as unreal. \"...time and space are one illusion...\" (T-26.VIII.1:3). We hope this sampling of references will help to clarify the confusion and will make reading A Course in Miracles a little easier."

In particular, I was reading Lesson 320 in the workbook: \"My Father gives all power unto me.\" I understand that maybe I am confusing levels, but I wonder if someone can explain this to me to add more understanding of where my  error lies. How can I use the Course to walk through this process of grief? The pain is so intense; I do not know how to ask for help.",
    "output": "It is quite understandable, in your desire to keep your beloved pet in your life that you would try to use all means you see available to save him. And unless you read Lesson 320 in the context of the whole Course, it is very easy to see it as telling you that you should have the power, among other things, to save your pet's life. But that is not what this lesson means. As with so many other words in A Course in Miracles, power has a specific meaning that is different from how we think of power from our ego-based perspective. To the ego, power refers to the capacity to change and control things in the world. But since the world, from Jesus' perspective if not yet ours, is illusory, then this is no real power at all. The Course says there are really only two kinds of power: the power to create and the power to choose or decide. The power to create, which involves simply the extension of the love that is our only reality, was given to us by God in our creation and remains within our mind even though we have covered it over and forgotten it. But this power functions only in the realm of spirit and has nothing to do with the ego world of bodies and form that we think is our reality. When we seemed to turn our back on the power of creation out of our desire to be separate, the power we made for ourselves in its place was the power of decision (T-14.VI.5:6), the power to turn away from the love of God and choose the ego in all its many expressions as our teacher and guide. But once we have made this power of decision real for ourselves, Jesus tells us we can give it another purpose (T-14.VI.5:6-7)--we can learn to choose the Holy Spirit instead of the ego as our Teacher and Guide, helping us to awaken from the nightmare dream of death and loss and grief that we have made our reality. For once we believe we are trapped within the world, the power to choose how we look at what we've made is the only real power available to us (T- 12.VII.9:1-2). All the so-called powers of the world simply keep us rooted in the illusion, continuously reinforcing our belief in limits and loss, reflecting our choice for the ego and all its ramifications. So when Lesson 320 says, \"Your [God's] Will can do all things in me, and then extend to all the world as well through me\" (W-pII.320.2:1), it means that when we choose the Holy Spirit as our Teacher, all the guilt that we experience as a result of our choice for separation can be undone through forgiveness. That forgiveness can then extend through us to other minds that also believe they are trapped in a body in the world. In the context of your beloved pets, this would mean that you would first recognize your own choice to make suffering and death real, and would then bring those thoughts and the guilt that accompanies them to the Holy Spirit for release. And in that moment when you allow your own mind to be healed, the peace within you will extend to those around you, including your little friends who may still be experiencing pain and fear in their own minds. And you will know in that moment that separation is not real and no one and nothing, including death, can deprive you of love. For a further consideration of how the Course looks at death and grief, you may also wish to look at #15. The important thing is to allow yourself to be gentle with the process of grieving."

Therefore, if we are unaware of the real source of our problems (the decision in our minds) it would be fruitless to hope for a problem-free life; we would just be fighting against ourselves. Moreover, part of the ego's strategy is to have us keep hoping that our problems can be solved, and that the day will come when we can live problem-free in the world. The objective of this strategy is to keep us focused on our lives in the world, because that ensures that we will never remember that we are really minds intent on keeping ourselves apart from the oneness in which we were created as Christ, and that that is just a silly, mistaken thought which we can choose against at any instant. Second, the Course's very gentle--and practical--approach to a situation such as the one you de-scribed, is to have us learn that the peace of God is within us and can never be affected by anything that appears to be going on in our lives. Being in a state of peace is always a matter of choice. No matter what the circumstances of our life may be, we can still choose to be peaceful. Jesus asks us to take him as our model in this. In the midst of circumstances seemingly far more traumatic, he said that he did not see himself as persecuted, and so he is saying to us that we can learn how to function that way, too (T-6.I.5-6). In a sense, you are saying that you are a victim of this recurring situation in your life, and we all have situations like this in some form or other. So the first thing we can learn is how to \"disconnect,\" we might say, our inner state from external situations. Not easy, but that is an essential part of the mind-training aspect of the Course. It is a major step in the process of recovering the power of our minds, which the ego would never want us to do. Third, when what appear to be negative situations keep recurring, it often is the case that the person is projecting his unconscious guilt onto his personal life--many times it is projected onto the body, resulting in illness--in an attempt to punish himself and ward off punishment by God, which is regarded as deserved and inevitable. Recurring failure or unhappiness often reflects the unconscious belief that if I am unsuccessful or unhappy, God will have pity on me and will go easy on me when it is my turn to stand before Him and give an accounting of my life. So if there is such a belief lodged in our minds, then we need there to be situations in our lives that will ensure that we are unsuccessful and unhappy. To fight against it would be self-defeating. The solution is obvious. As the workbook lessons constantly remind us, we need to go within and uncover the ego thoughts of sin, guilt, and fear that are directing everything we do and think as individuals and bring that darkness to the light. The goal of this process, though, is not to be free of problems in our lives, but to learn that it is the guilt we do not want, because the pain and turmoil from our external problems is nothing compared to the internal pain and bondage of our guilt. We do not have to try to change anything; we need only look with Jesus' love next to us at how we constantly attribute our unhappiness and failure to something other than our own decision, and then not judge ourselves for doing that. That is a giant step in the direction of finally restoring to our minds one day the peace of God that is our true in-heritance. When we are immersed in that peace and know it to be our shared identity, then it would make absolutely no difference whether our business is successful or not, just as it made no difference to Jesus whether there were nails in his hands and feet or not. Sometimes the external situation changes when we change our minds, but that no longer would matter to us, because our perception of ourselves and the world would have changed entirely."

    "text_input": "Q #114: There are two questions I have relating to true empathy and false empathy. I think I understand how A Course in Miracles is defining the difference between the two, but what I don't understand is how can you be loving, compassionate, and kind to your brother without falling into the trap of the ego? The second question is, when your brother is sick or has lost his job or a loved one, as I am understanding, is Jesus telling us to \"do nothing\"? This is difficult for me. If I say or do anything I am joining with the ego. How do I look at this differently?",
    "output": "True empathy comes from your right mind, which means you have joined with Jesus or the Holy Spirit. In that instant, you are beyond your ego, and therefore everything you do will be loving. You cannot fall into the trap of the ego when you are one with the love of Jesus in a holy instant, because that joining is a decision against the ego--the two states are mutually exclusive. Of course most of the time we jump right back into our wrong minds and into the ego trap of making the error real. When Jesus tells us we need do nothing, he means that we should do nothing on our own. He is not advocating passivity. He is teaching us that if we do not ask his help, or the help of the Holy Spirit, we almost certainly will fall into the ego trap. Then, in our wrong minds, our perception will be that the other person truly is an unfortunate victim, and that the kind and caring thing to do is to extend a helping hand to fix the problem and make him feel better. In that perception we have to-tally lost sight of the truth about our brother and about ourselves as well. We have fallen into the ego trap of making our brother mindless, which means we no longer see him or ourselves as minds that have chosen to reject our true Identity as Christ, and then project responsibility for that choice. Wrong-minded perception always sees victims and victimizers, not minds with the power of choice to reverse mistaken decisions and accept back into awareness the love that had been pushed away. If I am perceiving you that way, I cannot be truly helpful, even if I do fix the external situation and make you feel better. I have actually attacked you and myself, because the message I am giving is that I have something you do not have, and you are helpless. I have seen us as separate and have empathized with your weakness, thus confirming the ego's view of you, not Jesus' view of you. The correction of this faulty perception comes through asking for help to see through Jesus' eyes, or to share perception with the Holy Spirit. We bring our perception of victimization to Jesus or the Holy Spirit, because if I see you as a victim, then I am the one in need of healing. My perception needs to be corrected before I can be of help. Now we are not talking about what my physical eyes see. Objectively it may be the case that you have lost your job or a loved one; but to then conclude that you are a victim is an interpretation. That is where I make my mistake. Once I perceive you as a victim, I am implying that there is a victimizer, and that you are not responsible for your condition. That is the ego trap I have fallen into. When I first became aware that I was seeing you as a victim, I should have stopped right there and asked for help to look at the situation differently, to ask for help to empathize with the strength of Christ in you, rather than the weakness of the ego in you. If I make that shift from my wrong mind to my right mind, then I would automatically be guided to do whatever is most loving in the circumstances. That may be to do something or to do nothing, to say something or to say nothing. Whatever is most helpful would happen automatically, with no deliberation, and with no investment in the outcome."

    "text_input": "Q #115: I am 50 and going through menopause. There are physical changes going on, especially with my brain chemistry. My emotions are more intense than ever. I have been a student of A Course in Miracles for several years and had felt as if I had reached a certain level of peace and understanding, but now I find myself feeling a victim of my body and more insane than ever. Is this just another level of \"development of trust,\" and is even menopause about guilt?",
    "output": "The answer to your question lies in understanding the body and the role it plays in the ego thought system. Although we are told repeatedly in the Workbook: \"I am not a body\" (e.g., W- pI.199), the fact remains we do believe we are bodies, and we have conditions like menopause to prove it. Obviously the ego is the author of this belief. It tells us we somehow ended up in these bodies through no fault of our own, and now we are doomed to fall victim to all its ailments, until in the end we decay, die, and decompose. This message from the ego is purposeful. Its plan is to convince us that the body is real, and the mind is the illusion: \"The ego uses the body to conspire against your mind... The ego, which is not real, attempts to persuade the mind, which is real, that the mind is the ego's learning device; and further, that the body is more real than the mind is\" (T-6.IV.5:1-3). The ego has first used the body to house the guilt for having separated from God. Guilt is therefore built into all aspects of the body's functioning, including menopause. The body is then programmed to provide endless needs, as well as physical, emotional, and psychological conditions that very effectively serve as distractions, and convincing proof of its reality. The inevitable outcome is that we feel victimized and even attacked by the body. This insanity characterizes our relationship with the body, but only when we have chosen to identify with it, seeking to keep ourselves separate, believing all the ego's lies about who we are. Having made some progress in experiencing peace, it is understandable that the ego would find in menopause a great opportunity to strike again. This is nothing to be concerned with, and definitely nothing to feel guilty about. It is important to remember, however, that it is not helpful to deny any of the distressing symptoms of menopause, and it is certainly appropriate to seek professional medical treatment and support in any way that is helpful. In the process of learning to seek healing in our minds there is the comforting thought that menopause will end, and a beautiful passage in The Song of Prayer that applies especially for women in menopause: \"The universe is waiting your release because it is its own. Be kind to it and to yourself, and then be kind to Me. I ask but this; that you be comforted and live no more in terror and in pain. Do not abandon Love. Remember this; whatever you may think about yourself, whatever you may think about the world, your Father needs you and will call to you until you come to Him in peace at last\" (S-3.IV.10:3-7). The Course offers an alternative to the ego's use of the body, and an alternative to our definition of ourselves. This is where the \"development of trust\" enters the picture. You can see clearly the tricks the ego is up to, and make a decision to look at menopause differently, believing that what the Course is teaching is in fact true and worthy of trust. All of the symptoms related to menopause can be used as an opportunity to question the ego's interpretation of this, or any bodily condition. We turn to the mind for true healing in the process of dealing with menopause, monitoring all the thoughts you mention and any others that arise, so they can be given to the Holy Spirit for reinterpretation: \"The Holy Spirit, as always, takes what you have made and translates it into a learning device. Again as always, He reinterprets what the ego uses as an argument for separation into a demonstration against it. If the mind can heal the body, but the body cannot heal the mind, then the mind must be stronger than the body. Every miracle demonstrates this\" (T-6.V-A.2:4-7)."

    "text_input": "Q #116: I am somewhat at odds with the whole idea of God intervening in the world of form. I know that the Foundation's view is that since the world of form is an illusion, it is inconceivable that He could be involved in making changes and alterations in a world of form. I also know it is all about changing our thoughts about the world to bring us closer to waking. But in lesson 71 \"Only God's plan for salvation will work\" it actually has the separated mind ask God, \"What would you have me do? Where would you have me go? What would you have me say, and to whom?\" Isn't this asking God what direction you should take in the world of form? I also know that when I relinquish my ego thought and ask God to direct my thoughts then my world of form DOES change. Also how does A Course in Miracles reconcile Jesus being immaculately conceived? Wouldn't that be considered intervention into the illusion?",
    "output": "As discussed elsewhere in these Questions, it is important to recognize that much of the Course is written in metaphorical language, reaching us where we believe we are (e.g., see #72). And so God is described throughout the Course in ways that suggest He is concerned about us here in the world, only to provide a correction for our ego belief that God is an angry Father intent on our destruction. And so, rather than as our enemy, the Course is trying to help us view God as our Friend, Who will help us do what we need to do. In addition, it is very common in the Workbook lessons that God is used when the real meaning is God's Voice, or the Holy Spirit. As always, the larger context of the Course and, in this case, the lesson itself makes the deeper intent of lines such as those you quote clearer. This lesson first describes the ego's plan for salvation--holding grievances against others so that the guilt in our mind seems to rest on them rather than on ourselves--the blame game (W-pI.71.2). Clearly, this \"solution\" is the problem, because it in fact keeps the guilt alive in our minds rather than undoing it. And so God's (that is, the Holy Spirit's) plan, although not described specifically in this lesson, will have to involve being willing to release those grievances. Since our anger and judgments are triggered by our interactions with others, the direction to ask God for specific help that you refer to really means that we do not continue to act--doing, going, speaking, etc.--on our own, that is, with the ego's guidance. If we can carry the memory of God's Love with us as we move through our day, we can be sure that we will be just where we need to be to learn the lessons of forgiveness that will bring us the peace we seek. Now when we release ourselves from the ego's dictates and open ourselves up to the guidance of God's Voice, we may experience shifts in our external world, as you mention, although this may not always be the case. These changes occur not because God or the Holy Spirit has literally intervened but rather because we have been willing to make inner choices (often unconscious), aligned with love rather than hate. External projections of our guilt may then very well change, although this is never the purpose, from the Course's perspective, for changing our teacher. That becomes a trap, rooting our focus back in the world as we look for external changes to validate our inner shift. Virgin births and immaculate conceptions do suggest divine interventions in the world of form, but the Jesus of the Course never makes any of these claims about himself. The Bible and traditional Christianity represent a very different spiritual path from the Course and it is best not to confuse the two or try to integrate them in any way."

    "text_input": "Q #117: A Course in Miracles states that sickness is anger taken out on the body. What would cause a baby to become sick? For that matter, do animals have egos when they also become sick? Or is this all part of the dream which the ego has us waste our time trying to figure out?",
    "output": "A baby or an animal can become sick for the same reason that an adult human becomes sick. We think there should be a difference because we confuse the brain with the mind. Clearly, there are differences between the brain of a baby and the brain of an adult, or the brain of an animal and the brain of a human. But, despite what we all believe about the power and nature of the brain to control the body and behavior, Jesus tells us we are mistaken: \"You ... believe the body's brain can think. If you but understood the nature of thought, you could but laugh at this insane idea. It is as if you thought you held the match that lights the sun and gives it all its warmth; or that you held the world within your hand, securely bound until you let it go. Yet this is no more foolish than to believe ... the brain can think\" (W-pI.92.2). It is not the brain but the mind outside time and space that makes all decisions that seem to affect the body. And since the seemingly separate minds that are dreaming all the figures in the dream are really nothing more than fragments of the one split mind that is the source of all mistaken thought (T-18.I.3-5), their structure and content (sin, guilt and fear) are all the same. So it is the mind, not the brain that experiences guilt and anger and fear and looks for defenses against those thoughts and feelings. And the sickness of the mind--the thought of separation--is projected out onto the body, whether it be the body of an infant, an adult or an animal, so that it appears that something is happening to the body for which that individual is not responsible. Now just as the decision for sickness is made in the mind, so too is the decision for healing, which then may be reflected in the disappearance of symptoms and recovery from illness in the body of the infant, the adult, or the animal. For every fragmented split mind contains not only the ego but also the correction for the ego, which the Course calls the Holy Spirit."

    "text_input": "Q #118: My questions are prompted by my seeming experience of \"retaliation\" from my ego, which inevitably follows times when I have sincerely tried to look at my ego and asked for correction. The specific forms this takes can be severe enough to shut me down physically, as well as mentally. Should we expect this to occur?  I know the Course talks about the ego vacillating \"between suspiciousness and viciousness\" shifting to viciousness if I try to seek relief from it, offering me then \"the illusion of attack as a 'solution'\" (T-9.VIII.2:7,9-10). So if my ego offers me the \"illusion of attack,\" then I am off the hook. I've not really chosen the attack and I'm not responsible for it--my ego did it to me. But I don't really believe this at all. I think the decision making part of my mind is choosing attack to protect my ego identification--my special, separate identity--and that things are going to get a whole lot worse if I continue to go against it. At these times there is no way that I can look at my ego and simply smile at it. I just have to back off. I will be grateful for your answers and comments.",
    "output": "Yes, you are right--the ego has no power to attack you except for the power you give it. Jesus clarifies this early in the text: \"Only your allegiance to it gives the ego any power over you. I have spoken of the ego as if it were a separate thing, acting on its own. This was necessary to persuade you that you cannot dismiss it lightly, and must realize how much of your thinking is ego-directed. We cannot safely let it go at that, however, or you will regard yourself as necessarily conflicted as long as you are here, or as long as you believe that you are here. The ego is nothing more than a part of your belief about yourself\" (T-4.VI.1:2-6) . As the passage you cite indicates, self-attack is not uncommon when we seek relief from the ego. And that is a reflection of our fear of accepting the limitless love in which the self we believe we are has no meaning, as you suggest. So your question really is, what do you do now, knowing that your fear is still so great? The part of ourselves that remains identified with the ego does not want us to take even a single step in the direction of forgiveness and healing if it can prevent it. And anything that increases rather than reduces our fear really serves the ego's purpose. So Jesus counsels us that if our resistance is strong, we should not fight ourselves because we are just not ready (T-30.I.1:6-7). The most kind and loving thing we can do then is to be patient and gentle with ourselves--there is no urgency about the process of forgiveness. We may not yet be ready to bring the darkness of our ego to Jesus, but we can at least bring our fear to him, acknowledging that we need his help. And if Jesus is part of the problem, we can use the less threatening symbol of the Holy Spirit, or any other symbol of love to which we relate that brings us comfort. The important thing is to develop an awareness of the loving, nonjudgmental presence within your mind, with whom you can look at the darkness of your ego together. If you look by yourself, you will almost certainly frighten yourself. But if you look with love beside you, the seeming seriousness of what you are uncovering will gradually dissipate. And then you will be able to smile at it."

    "text_input": "Q #119: First of all, thank you for the answers to my two former questions: the one about addiction and the one about seeing calls for love. I was glad with these answers and still read them over sometimes. My friends still tell me that I should not undertake behavioral changes, but only look at what my ego is doing. On some level, I trust that I will learn my lessons. Since I began studying A Course in Miracles, I feel like I am not truly seeking anymore. I have found, and need to practice now. My greatest barrier or stumbling block still is worldly distractions versus God, the ego-offerings versus God. I know that the peace of God is all I want. And at the same time, apparently, I do not want the peace of God. Sometimes, when I have a glimpse of the peace of God, I have a sort of friendly sadness because then I know it is such a gift already, so much better and lovelier than all these worldly distractions.",
    "output": "Trust and gentleness are essential in the practice and application of the Course, which you seem to be learning. This means getting more and more comfortable with your inner teacher and developing more and more of a personal relationship with Jesus or the Holy Spirit, so that in those instants in which you are beyond your ego, you would know clearly what the most loving thing for you would be--to make a behavioral change or to simply continue to watch your ego in action, fully aware of what you are doing and what it is costing you, and then not judging yourself for being so resistant. We all have a split mind, and we all go back and forth between the ego's offerings and Jesus' offerings. This is normal, and we should not be surprised that we do this. This is the way we learn that we are mistaken, but not sinful: \"Son of God, you have not sinned, but you have been much mistaken. Yet this can be corrected and God will help you, knowing that you could not sin against Him\" (T-10.V.6:1-2). We are learning that the world is a projection of our own thoughts, \"the outside picture of an inward condition\" (T-21.in.1:5). So the point is to welcome that learning, to welcome each opportunity to learn that you only imagine that the world has the power to take away the peace of God. Being afraid of \"worldly distractions\" only gives them power; and then you will never learn that it is made up. The goal is to achieve a state of inner peace that nothing can disturb, no matter what happens. If you stay isolated and secluded, you are implying that something outside you has power to take away the peace of God. That is foolish. It would be more helpful to go to Jesus after a period of indulging your ego and tell him about everything you thought and did, and that you realize you chose against him, but that you also realize that his love for you has not been affected, and that one day you will not be so afraid to have his love for you, and yours for him, be the center of your life. The pain of excluding that love from your life eventually will become too much to bear, and so the amount of time you spend indulging your ego will grow less and less. Again, though, this does not mean that you may not be guided to make a behavioral change as a way of diminishing the pain you are inflicting on yourself. The behavioral change then would not be perceived as sacrificial, but an expression of gentleness toward yourself."

    "text_input": "Q #120: Did Jesus ever discuss giving up meat during any of his talks with Helen? In the Essene Gospels, he talks quite a bit about not eating meat. What's your view on this?",
    "output": "In scribing A Course in Miracles, Helen Schucman did not receive any instruction regarding eating meat--the topic was not discussed. The Course is not the same teaching as the Essene Gospels. It is a Course on content, not form, and so there are no directives for behavior, as in the Essene Gospels. There are two very important principles of the course that may be helpful to consider in response to your question, both are stated in the same passage: \"There is no life outside of Heaven. Where God created life, there life must be. In any state apart from Heaven life is illusion\" (T-23.II.19:1- 3). If no life exists outside of Heaven, and any other state is an illusion, it would be very inconsistent with the Course's teaching that any kind of behavior in the dream be awarded significance. The Course is teaching us to become aware of the interpretation we give to everything, thereby becoming aware of the thoughts, beliefs, and judgments that make up our ego thought system. In this way we will be able to learn to see the true connection between cause and effect, and understand that the source of all our pain is in the mind. Therefore the only thing the Course asks us to do is pay attention to our thoughts, see them as the cause of any condition we may find ourselves in, and bring them to the Holy Spirit so they can be transformed. Beyond this the Course does not give any specific behavioral directives for choices made in an hallucination: \"What if you recognized this world is an hallucination?\" (T-20.VIII.7:3). Based on these important principles of the Course it is not in keeping with its thought system to abstain from meat because it means killing a \"living\" creature, or because it is a \"spiritually superior\" thing to do. With regard to this, as to any specific situation or problem we may have, the Course instructs us to ask but one question: \"This is the question that you must learn to ask in connection with everything. What is the purpose? Whatever it is, it will direct your efforts automatically\" (T-4.V.6:8-10). Everything serves the purpose of the ego or that of the Holy Spirit. Whether we eat meat or refrain from eating meat, the important thing to remember is that we do not make decisions by ourselves: \"You will not make decisions by yourself whatever you decide. For they are made with idols or with God\" (T-30.I.14:7-8). Our choice will reinforce the ego's thought system, that the world is real, and what we eat makes a difference, or the Holy Spirit's thought system, that the world is an illusion, and the only thing that matters in the dream is healing our mind of the thought that we believe we separated from God. Regarding specific behavior, Krishnamurti offered very helpful advice to one of his followers in reference to having sex, which we can paraphrase to apply to your question: \"Eat meat, or don't eat meat, but get on with it.\""

    "text_input": "Q #121: It has been said that we created the body after the separation. With all of the beauty that is of this earth that can be seen, as well as the incredible variety of life that thrives here, did God create the physical earth, or did we?",
    "output": "Before answering your question, we must clarify that in A Course in Miracles, the term \"create\" is used only in reference to God's ability to create. His creation is His Son who abides with Him in Heaven. When speaking about the physical world in the dream illusion, including the body, the Course uses the term \"made\" or \"miscreate.\" It is unmistakable in its teaching regarding the origin of the physical world: \"The world you see is an illusion of a world. God did not create it, for what He creates must be eternal as Himself\" (C-4.1:1-2). Thus, neither the world nor the body exists in reality. Since our experience of being physical bodies living in a physical world seems so real to us, it is important to keep in mind, as we speak of the world, that none of this could ever actually occur. In this dream of separation the world is the place where the sleeping son, consumed with guilt at having seemingly separated from God, comes to hide from the imagined wrath of a punishing God. A Course in Miracles teaches that the ego, gone mad with guilt, made the world, along with the body, not only to hide from God, but to keep God out of awareness: \"The world was made as an attack on God. It symbolizes fear. And what is fear except love's absence? Thus the world was meant to be a place where God could enter not, and where His Son could be apart from Him\" (W-pII.3.2:1-4). Clearly then, according to the thought system of the Course, God did not make the world. It is the effect of the thought of separation, and is maintained by the ongoing guilt of that thought: \"The world you see is what you gave it, nothing more than that ... It is the witness to your state of mind, the outside picture of an inward condition\" (T-21.in.1:2,5). This does not mean that we should seek to see the good and the beautiful in the world, as opposed to the evil and the ugly. It refers to the choice we have of seeing the ego's interpretation of the world, or the Holy Spirit's. The ego looks at the beauty and variety in the world as proof that the world is real, that God \"created\" it, and that our pursuit of enjoyment in this world is blessed by Him. In accord with this thinking, God also made the devastating natural disasters that afflict the world, the so called \"acts of God\" found in our insurance policies. God must then be cruel indeed. The ego's thinking makes God responsible not only for the beauty, but for all the various forms of physical, psychological, and emotional suffering we find in this world. The apparent beauty of the world captures our attention as a ploy of the ego to keep us engaged in its lie--that happiness is possible outside of Heaven. For further thoughts on our experience of beauty in the world, please see our answer to #70."

    "text_input": "Q #123: I'd really appreciate elaboration on P-2.VI.5. My specific question is: will the body part I am presently projecting my unforgiveness onto give me an insight into the particular issue that I need to undo at this time? How will analyzing the form of my sickness enable me to better understand what issue is at the \"tip of the iceberg\"?",
    "output": "To begin, let's take a look at the full passage, the first three sentences of which you refer to: \"Sickness takes many forms, and so does unforgiveness. The forms of one but reproduce the forms of the other, for they are the same illusion. So closely is one translated into the other, that a careful study of the form a sickness takes will point quite clearly to the form of unforgiveness that it represents. Yet seeing this will not effect a cure. That is achieved by only one recognition; that only forgiveness heals an unforgiveness, and only an unforgiveness can possibly give rise to sickness of any kind\" (P-2.VI.5). As this asserts, there should be a clear correspondence between the specific thought of guilt in the mind and its shadow--the symptom--in the world. Freud made a similar kind of claim in his analyses of hysterical symptoms. However, your conclusion can only be as good as the honesty of your introspection and as accurate as your willingness to uncover what anger, fear and judgments may be buried in your unconscious. And there is no set of fixed rules that leads inexorably from specific thought to specific symptom. For example, a sprained ankle may reflect a real ambivalence about stepping forward on a certain fearful career or relationship path for one person. But for another person or for the same person at another time, the sprain may be evidence of guilt over the desire to kick someone else when he is down. And for someone else, the fear of going forward could be manifested in laryngitis-- losing one's voice--rather than in spraining an ankle. There may even be some kind of so-called past life associations to the present symptom which are even more difficult to uncover. Nevertheless, there will be times when the correspondence is quite apparent. Seeing such links between an unforgiving thought and a specific symptom can be especially helpful as you first begin your work with A Course in Miracles, for it reinforces the recognition the Course is attempting to develop in our awareness of the true cause-effect relationship between mind and body. We incorrectly see a false relationship between external agents or events as causes and bodily changes as effects (e.g., a virus and flu symptoms), rather than the true relationship between the thoughts of the mind as cause and changes in the body as effects (e.g., guilt and flu symptoms). But, as the above passage from the Psychotherapy supplement points out, seeing such connections is not enough in itself to bring about true healing. Only forgiveness can do that. And as you continue with your study of the Course, the good news is that you do not need to uncover the link between a specific form of guilt and a specific symptom. Any symptom of disease or dis- ease in the body is a projection of the guilt in the mind that is the self-hatred we all carry inside ourselves over our belief that we attacked and destroyed love when we chose the thought of separation. And every symptom, regardless of its form, represents nothing other than the ego's attempt to persuade you that your problems are in the world and in your body, and not in your mind. So once the ego's ruse is recognized and the real association between the guilt in the mind and effects on the body is acknowledged, most of your work is completed. The next step is simply to turn to your internal Teacher for help in undoing your belief in that guilt. Your part in the forgiveness process is now complete. External symptoms may or may not shift at this point, but they will no longer concern you, as you have identified the real source of your discomfort and pain. As Jesus observes in the manual in the section on healing, \"What do guilt and sickness, pain, disaster and all suffering mean now? Having no purpose, they are gone. And with them also go all the effects they seemed to cause. Cause and effect but replicate creation. Seen in their proper perspective, without distortion and without fear, they re-establish Heaven\" (M-5.II.4:7- 11)."

    "text_input": "Q #124: What does the term magic mean when used in A Course in Miracles?",
    "output": "Magic is \"an attempt to solve a problem where it is not ... guilt is projected outside our minds onto others (attack) or our bodies (sickness) and sought to be corrected there, rather than being undone in our minds by bringing it to the Holy Spirit ... \" (Glossary-Index for A Course in Miracles, 7th ed., p.157, Kenneth Wapnick). The ego uses magic in its interpretation of any problem or conflict; it sees the problem as outside of the mind, and seeks to solve it by external means. When we choose to believe this ego version, and identify with the ego thought system, we use magic to solve our problems, and it does seem to work. For example, when we take an aspirin for a headache and the pain goes away, we believe the aspirin took the headache away. The Course is telling us that what actually happens is that there is a decision in the mind to experience pain in the form of a headache, and then a decision in the mind against pain, which is symbolized by taking an aspirin: \"Special agents [i.e., medicine] seem to be ministering to him, yet they but give form to his own choice. He chooses them in order to bring tangible form to his desires. And it is this they do, and nothing else. They are not actually needed at all\" (M-5.II.2:8- 11). Of course, there is nothing wrong with using \"magic\" forms--money, clothing, social contacts, medicine, etc. In fact, we cannot function in this world without them, and we should not feel guilty or \"unspiritual\" when as we use them. But we can do so without endowing them with the power to make us truly happy or meet our real need, which is joining with the Holy Spirit, the memory of God, in the mind. The same magic principle is at work whenever we think we can effect change in the world by resolving conflicts through changes in behavior, never realizing that the conflict originates in our mind and only there can it truly be solved. The Course asks us to learn to recognize the problem where it is, in the mind, so it can be healed: \" ... decisions are of the mind, not of the body. If sickness is but a faulty problem-solving approach, it is a decision. And if it is a decision, it is the mind and not the body that makes it\" (M-5.II.4-6). A Course in Miracles also tells us there is only one problem--the thought of separation from God. Believing this thought is the cause of tremendous guilt and feelings of emptiness, despair, and need. This drives us to seek to fill our need and assuage our pain externally through magic, making the whole world a \"magic show\": \"In this world, you believe you are sustained by everything but God. Your faith is placed in the most trivial and insane symbols; pills, money, 'protective' clothing, influence, prestige, being liked, knowing the 'right' people, and an endless list of forms of nothingness that you endow with magical powers\" (W-pI.50.1:2-3). Whatever form of magic we choose it will not truly work. The Course is asking us to undo our belief in magic by recognizing the problem: \"If you could recognize that your only problem is separation, no matter what form it takes, you could accept the answer because you would see its relevance. Perceiving the underlying constancy in all the problems that seem to confront you, you would understand that you have the means to solve them all. And you would use the means, because you recognize the problem\" (W-pI.79.6:2-4). The \"means\" we have is the power of our mind to choose, and our choice is always between magic and the miracle; between seeking outside ourselves in the illusion, and going within to the mind where our decisions can be changed."

    "text_input": "Q #125: I have been studying A Course in Miracles for about 3 years. I have two questions. First, where are you at, as far as the Course goes, in other words, is there a point at which it all comes together? Second, I feel as if I am and have always been in \"a waiting mode\"--I want to say a state of anticipation, but not really. I'm tired of \"waiting\" my life away. Can you give me some advice on this?",
    "output": "We are not quite sure of what you mean by \"a point where it all comes together.\" The Course works, if that is what you mean. It is an individualized curriculum (M-9.1:5), and therefore the specifics of the process vary from student to student. Our learning is always in the context of the relationships and circumstances in our lives, and the goal of the exercises in the workbook is generalization, so that as we go along, we would gradually learn to apply the principles every minute of every day, without getting stuck in specifics. That is when \"it all comes together.\" Our habitual response to all happenings in our daily lives would be to bring our ego thoughts to the love of Jesus in our minds; and then as our resistance is brought to light and relinquished, we would choose against the ego and allow our minds to be healed, thus restoring to them the awareness of love's presence that we had banished. Our lives then would be directed from this quiet center of peace: \"And you will be more aware of this quiet center of the storm than all its raging activity. This quiet center, in which you do nothing, will remain with you, giving you rest in the midst of every busy doing on which you are sent. For from this center will you be directed how to use the body sinlessly. It is this center from which the body is absent, that will keep it so in your awareness of it\" (T-18.VII.8:2-5). It is difficult to respond to your second question without knowing more about you. So we will just speak in general about the pattern you describe, which is not all that uncommon. The Course speaks a great deal about fear--and even terror--that is the consequence of our having listened to the ego instead of the Holy Spirit. We are not consciously aware of the fear at this level of our minds, and the fear of which we are aware is always attributed to something in the world or in our physical/psychological experience, both of which are outside the mind. But the fear that Jesus talks about accounts, in part, for the different patterns our lives take. The fear is related to our expectation of punishment by God for having separated from Him, and is also related to the promise we made to the ego to be faithful to it no matter what. Our very existence as individuals, therefore, is associated in our minds with fear and dread on a scale that nothing in the world can approximate. Instead of bringing the fear to Jesus who would help us realize that it is totally unjustified, we listen to the ego who warns us that we had better do something about it. Then our lives are essentially constructed as a defense against this fear. This manifests in different ways; but one way would be to never get your life going--like waiting at a traffic light that never turns green. Unconsciously, the fear would be that no matter what you do, you are doomed. The maladaptive solution to that fear is to stay in neutral so that you never have to take responsibility for anything, because deep within your mind is the thought \"I set out on my own once before and look what I did. I killed love off so that I could exist. I'm a terrible person, so I'll see to it that I never make anything of my life, so that I will not be caught and held to account for the awful thing I did.\" Nothing can change in such a situation until the internal state of terror is acknowledged and looked at. Sometimes this requires the assistance of a compassionate therapist, but not always. Jesus encourages us to take this step with him by our side: \"We are ready to look more closely at the ego's thought system because together we have the lamp that will dispel it, and since you realize you do not want it, you must be ready. Let us be very calm in doing this, for we are merely looking honestly for truth\" (T-11.V.1:3-4). We need the help of someone outside this thought system of sin, guilt, and fear, who sees its unreality, but who sees as well the destructive effect is has had in the minds of those who have forgotten that it is all just a made-up fable."

    "text_input": "Q #126: Did Jesus heal by simply seeing the \"Christ\" in another?",
    "output": "Since you use the past tense \"did\" in your question, we should first clarify that the teachings of A Course in Miracles on healing are not based on, nor related to, the Gospel accounts of healing by the historical Jesus. This is an important clarification, because the Course interpretation of \"healing,\" \"Christ,\" and \"Jesus\" differs from the traditional Christian interpretation. With that in mind, we begin by recalling that the Course tells us healing is always of the mind: \"Since only the mind can be sick, only the mind can be healed. Only the mind is in need of healing\" (P-in.1:2-3). Therefore, no one, including Jesus, actually heals another: \"Healing does not come from anyone else. You must accept guidance from within\" (T-8.IV.4:5- 6). By the same token, anyone whose mind is healed, including Jesus, serves as a reminder to someone who perceives himself as unhealed; that he too can make the choice for healing by accepting the truth about himself. A \"healed healer,\" one of whom is Jesus, thus serves as a reflection of the truth for anyone who is truly willing to be healed. This may be what you refer to as \"seeing the Christ in another.\" It means looking without judgment, without difference, and seeing the other as sinless. This is what heals the mind. Accepting the truth about ourselves, which is healing, inherently means accepting ourselves as joined with the entire Sonship. Thus when we accept healing for ourselves, we accept it for the entire Sonship. This is what the Course means when it tells us we are not healed alone--the truth of who we are is the same truth for everyone, and includes everyone. \"That is why it makes no difference to what part or by what part of the Sonship the healing is offered. Every part benefits, and benefits equally\" (T-5.in.2:6-7). We are not separate individuals seeking individual healing. There is no \"individual\" to be healed. Therefore, when Jesus accepted the Atonement for himself we were all with him, and were healed along with him. Only our acceptance is required for us to bring this healing to our awareness. Since all sickness is separation, all healing is joining: \"Healing is the effect of minds that join, as sickness comes from minds that separate\" (T- 28.III.2:6). We are healed when we choose to join with Jesus in accepting our healing. This is how the Course tells us healing is accomplished."

    "text_input": "Q #127: Can you help me reconcile the fact that there is only One Self or One Mind and that I perceive myself as a unique consciousness? Is my perception of having a unique consciousness an illusion?",
    "output": "As real as it seems to us, our unique individual consciousness is in fact part of the ego's bag of illusions. In fact, consciousness is the first trick the ego pulled out of that illusory bag. A Course in Miracles tells us early in the text that \"consciousness, the level of perception\" is in fact within the illusory ego realm, and that it is \"the first split introduced into the mind after the separation.\" If you think of the fact that perception necessarily involves a self that is perceiving and an other that is perceived, you may be able to understand why the Course says that consciousness necessarily involves a separated mind and so can't be real. In Heaven, the realm of knowledge or One-mindedness, on the other hand, there is no separation and so there can be no perception, that is, no self to perceive an other (T-3.IV.1-3). Near the end of the book, the Course refers to the illusory nature of individual consciousness, observing that \"in this world, because the mind is split, the Sons of God appear to be separate. Nor do their minds seem to be joined. In this illusory state, the concept of an 'individual mind' seems to be meaningful\" (C-1.2:1-3). And in case we have still not gotten the point, it adds that \"consciousness has levels and awareness can shift quite dramatically, but it cannot transcend the perceptual realm. At its highest it becomes aware of the real world [totally healed perception], and can be trained to do so increasingly. Yet the very fact that it has levels and can be trained demonstrates that it cannot reach knowledge\" (C-1.7:4-6). So consciousness will be left behind, or transcended, when our mind is completely healed of the mistaken thought of separation and returns to the realm of knowledge or One-mindedness. It is this seeming loss of individual, unique consciousness that is at the root of all the fear we ultimately associate with the practice of forgiveness. Yet we will never be called upon to relinquish this false self and will let it go only when it no longer has any value or meaning for us. So the ego's fear of annihilation is just one further trick it pulls from its illusory bag to keep us rooted in its thought system. For further discussions of mind and consciousness, you may wish to review Questions #27, #32, and #65."

    "text_input": "Q #128: I have struggled with clinical depression for the last five years or so. When I do not take medication I become very tired and am not able to concentrate. I find this condition difficult to live with. However, when I do take the medication I am able to concentrate and I do not feel tired. My question is: A Course in Miracles says that we are not bodies. Our bodies are projections made by the ego. If there is something wrong with the body, the ego caused it. What do I have to do to heal this depression on a spiritual level so that I will not have to take this medication anymore?",
    "output": "Forgive. That's all you have to do. In case that answer seems too flippant, a few more words may be helpful. Everything we do here in the world to address our bodily limits and needs is what the Course calls magic (for a further discussion of magic, in the context of addictions and 12-step programs, see #57). It's all magic because we are not addressing the real problem and source of all of our symptoms, including experiencing ourselves as a body. The real problem is always and only the guilt in our ego mind. And the only way to address that problem is through practicing forgiveness, which means learning, with the help of Jesus or the Holy Spirit, not to judge the projections of our ego so that they can be withdrawn and healed in the mind where they originated. Now there may be a stigma associated in your mind with taking medication for depression and that may in fact be where you want to begin with your forgiveness process. The fact is that eating and sleeping are also forms of magic we use to cope with what otherwise would be unpleasant or dysfunctional states. But most of us do not ask what we would have to do to heal our hunger or weariness on a spiritual level so that we would no longer need to take food or to sleep anymore. And the Course tells us that all illusions are the same--there is no hierarchy in reality (T- 26.VII.6). So you may first want to learn to forgive yourself for your limitations, that is, learn not to judge yourself for the fact that you perceive yourself as a body, with all the needs that accompany seeing yourself in a bodily state, including taking medication for depression. Jesus gently reminds us, \"Do not despair, then, because of limitations. It is your function to escape from them, but not to be without them\" (M-26.4:1-2). Then, rather than attempting to find a spiritual means to wean yourself from your antidepressant, it may be much more beneficial to ask for help in getting in touch with the underlying guilt that is triggering the symptoms of depression, so that can be healed. All symptoms are simply signals that we still want the separation and all its ramifications to be real. But that desire has a cost and that cost is what we want to begin to get more in touch with. Seeing ourselves as eternally separate from love, with no way home, is the most depressing state we could possibly experience. But the good news is that the separation is not really true. As we see the cost of believing in the separation--which includes depression over the perceived hopelessness of our present \"reality\"--the desire for a different way of seeing will gradually grow within us, until that becomes all that we want. For we will have learned that the only place of real hope is in our mind, where the presence of love is always available to us to lead us back home."

    "text_input": "Q #129: I have been a student of A Course in Miracles for over 20 years, and in that time I have noticed that my active involvement waxes and wanes significantly. I find that my ego is once again getting the upper hand, and apart from some very useful self-insight, I'm more or less back to where I started. I sometimes wonder if my little willingness perhaps is a bit too little. I understand that our investment in our egos is far greater than we realize, but I sometimes get frustrated that after all these years my mind still wanders so easily after so much effort to train it. In the end, I'm still looking for even an inkling of the peace of God. Do you have any comments, or advice, or encouragement to help me (and perhaps other students like me) see this from a broader perspective, and maybe get back on track?",
    "output": "There are several thoughts that might help you \"get back on track\" and put your experience in a positive perspective. First of all, you are not alone in this experience, it is \"normal,\" and the process of forgiveness is difficult. It may not seem particularly comforting, but we are clearly told that we are learning impaired, and so we should not be surprised when we have difficulty in our Course practice. \"You have learning handicaps in a very literal sense. There are areas in your learning skills that are so impaired that you can progress only under constant, clear-cut direction, provided by a Teacher Who can transcend your limited resources. He becomes your Resource because of yourself you cannot learn. The learning situation in which you placed yourself is impossible, and in this situation you clearly require a special Teacher and a special curriculum\" (T-12.V.5:1-4). Please remember that this message applies to all students of the Course, and the obvious implication is that the training program the Course teaches is difficult for us. It is simple and clear, but it is not easy. The Course teaching ultimately leads to the undoing of everything we believe about everything, including, and especially, about ourselves. It is very understandable that we would be inconsistent, and even quite resistant, in applying its principles to our lives. As has been stated on many occasions, if the Course were easy we wouldn't need it. It is designed by a very wise Teacher as a life-long study, with good reason. In the process, it is very important not to judge yourself for apparent \"failures,\" as this will certainly result in more guilt, and would accomplish the ego's plan to defend itself against the learning of the Course. It might be helpful to consider all the thoughts you have about the degree of your willingness, and your feelings of frustration, as typical ego ploys to keep you off track (or off course, if you'll pardon the pun). If you think it would be helpful, you might introduce some structure into your study, either by using the guidelines in the workbook lessons, or setting aside a specific time of the day to read a passage of the Course. Sometimes it is helpful to make a practice of reviewing the day before going to bed--to identify the thoughts that caused any discomfort, or often stronger emotions. These thoughts and feelings represent the judgments that are making peace impossible. The review also seems to help keep us in tune with ourselves, and keep us more vigilant the next day. Any attempt is worth the effort, as it will rekindle the tiny spark of willingness. Another important thing to remember is that our usual understanding of time does not apply to our practice of the Course. Since all there is is the present moment in which I choose either to listen to the Holy Spirit or the ego, in one sense we are always at the starting place. Furthermore, whenever we apply any of the Course teaching to our lives, or to our relationships, however \"little\" it may seem to be, time becomes irrelevant. It may be heartening to realize that whether 20 years, or 20 minutes have passed since the last practical application, the time lag has no effect on the efficacy of our learning. No doubt you are aware that the entire thought system of the ego can be undone in an instant. And when you make the mistake of turning again to the ego, it is possible to start over, free of judgment, and confident that One goes with you as you wax and wane, unconcerned with your detours or meanderings. When the ego proffers its interpretation and evaluation of our progress it is helpful to remember that the Course does not qualify \"little willingness.\" No willingness is too little, and we are not equipped to judge our progress in the first place. We do well to remember: \"Your little effort and small determination call on the power of the universe to help you, and God Himself will raise you from darkness into light. You are in accord with His Will. You cannot fail because your will is His\" (W-pI.69.7:2-4)."

    "text_input": "Q #130: What is \"true empathy,\" as opposed to \"false empathy,\" and how can one practice it?",
    "output": "The \"true empathy\" described in A Course in Miracles is perceiving the real need that is in all parts of the separated Sonship, which is the need for healing the thought of separation in the mind, no matter what form it takes. It sees the problem where it is, which is in the mind. It is an application of one of the basic principles of the Course: \"Ideas leave not their source, and their effects but seem to be apart from them. Ideas are of the mind. What is projected out, and seems to be external to the mind, is not outside at all, but an effect of what is in, and has not left its source\" (T-26.VII.4:7-9). This means seeing beyond the circumstances of the situation that seem to be the problem--sickness, scarcity of any kind, emotional or psychological turmoil, natural disasters, etc.--and recognizing that none of these has any effect on the true Self. They do not have the power to take peace away, and their solution lies in the individual's ability to also recognize this, and to make a choice for peace instead of distress. True empathy comes from a choice in the mind to look with the Holy Spirit's true perception, which sees only an expression of love or a call for love (T-14.X.7). The response then is to let the Holy Spirit's love flow to the person \"in need\" in whatever form would be most helpful and loving. Most likely it would not mean verbally telling someone that they have made a wrong choice and can choose again, which could be an attack, increasing fear and anxiety. Once the choice is made to see with the Holy Spirit, and not to believe the ego's interpretation of a situation, the specific response will come through naturally. The intent is to join with the other person on the level of the mind where the answer to the problem lies. This does not preclude helping someone find specific solutions or external help with a problem, but the content of the mind, the Holy Spirit's true perception, would be clear. The real cause and the real solution lie in the power of the mind to choose. \"False empathy\" is the ego's perception of victimization. The ego sees a victim who is being attacked by some outside force, whether it be a disease, another person, or some catastrophic event, and believes the person is in need of an external solution to the problem. False empathy can be the motive for some people to see themselves as the \"rescuers\" who can offer help to a victim in resolving their predicament, with no awareness of the mind's choice. From this perspective, the two people agree that there is a victim and a victimizer, and a solution external to the mind can be found. It is an agreement made from madness. The Course is very clear that false empathy, because it denies the power of the mind, is actually an attack. It will not only not solve the problem, it actually operates in a way that exacerbates the problem because it reinforces separation: \"The clearest proof that empathy as the ego uses it is destructive lies in the fact that it is applied only to certain types of problems and in certain people. These it selects out, and joins with. And it never joins except to strengthen itself\" (T-16.I.2:1-3). A clear indication of false empathy is when a distinction is made between those who are deserving of support or help, while excluding others. This is true especially when those who are excluded are identified as the \"victimizers\" who are not only undeserving of sympathy, but merit punishment of some sort. When we find ourselves seeing victims and victimizers, as when disaster strikes, we have an opportunity to step aside from the ego's initial interpretation and consider what the Course tells us: \"You do not know what empathizing means. Yet of this you may be sure; if you will merely sit quietly by and let the Holy Spirit relate through you, you will empathize with strength, and will gain in strength and not in weakness\" (T-16.I.2:6-7). Our practice of true empathy begins with the recognition of our false empathy, and our usual confusion about cause and effect. That is why we do not know what empathizing means. Once we are honest about our misperceptions, the full extent of our belief in the ego's thought system begins to reveal itself. This recognition, along with questioning the validity of the ego's interpretation, will allow our perception to gradually shift, and our response to be transformed by the Holy Spirit. His true empathy will then meet our real need, and everyone's real need, for the healing of the mind. This is the real answer to the real problem."

    "text_input": "Q #131: I have been a follower of A Course in Miracles for many years. My questions are: God must know the pain and suffering we are having. He is God, how can He not hear the cries of His child? Why has He forsaken us? Surely there must be a better way.",
    "output": "The Course's path is different from the traditional biblical paths that are characterized by prayer and supplication to God to do something about our plight. A Course in Miracles presents itself as a correction of traditional biblical spirituality. Its distinctive approach is to teach us that the problem in our relationship with God is entirely on our end, and that our lives reflect the thought system in our minds that we are choosing to uphold. God simply is (W-pI.169.5), and knows nothing of this world of separation. It is we who are blocking the awareness of love's presence in our minds (T-in.1:7). Therefore, the thrust of the Course is to explain to us how we are blocking love and what we can do to restore it to our awareness: \"Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all of the barriers within yourself that you have built against it\" (T-16.IV.6:1). It teaches that salvation is our responsibility and within our grasp. It centers on the practice of forgiveness in the context of the Atonement principle, which states that the separation from God never occurred; it was just \"a tiny, mad idea\" that never happened in reality. We are simply dreaming a dream of sin, guilt, and fear that have led to lives dominated by suffering and death. The role of Jesus or the Holy Spirit is to help us view our lives through their eyes and with their help eventually awaken from this nightmare dream. The starting point in this process of awakening, though, is to take responsibility for the conditions that prevail in our lives, because they are the direct result of the thought system of the ego in our minds, to which we have secretly vowed eternal allegiance. The \"other way\" is to turn to Jesus for help in looking at our secret wish to be separate from God and each other. He reassures us: \"I will never leave you or forsake you, because to forsake you would be to forsake myself and God Who created me. You forsake yourself and God if your forsake any of your brothers. You must learn to see them as they are, and understand they belong to God as you do\" (T-5.IV.6:5-7). The Course teaches us that the Holy Spirit is present within our minds as both the memory of God that we took with us into the dream, and the bridge that we will cross when we have chosen against the ego and have seen our interests as the same, not separate from God or others: \"His memory has not gone by, and left a stranded Son forever on a shore where he can glimpse another shore that he can never reach. His Father wills that he be lifted up and gently carried over. He has built the bridge, and it is He Who will transport His Son across it. Have no fear that He will fail in what He wills. Nor that you be excluded from the Will that is for you\" (T-28.I.15:5-9)."

    "text_input": "Q #132: In section VIII of the excerpt series \"Jesus: The Manifestation of the Holy Spirit,\" Ken discusses Helen's experience of having an eyelash in her eye. And, using the analogy of videos, he says there is a video of Helen with the lash in her eye, and one of Helen with the lash outside of her eye. I understand that these two situations reflect her decision to separate and then to join with the love of Jesus. But I am confused as to how I can apply this to my own life.  I gather that there is a video wherein I get what I want and one where I do not. I have lived in apartments for years and have begun to think it would be better for me to have my own home because it would help me to feel more secure. I can see that my \"homelessness\" would reflect my feeling that I have left God. But I don't quite get how joining with Jesus would result in my finding a home of my own.  To cut to the chase, how do I switch from the one video of the problem to the other of its solution? Is this a matter of belief, or of will? I don't understand the dynamics, or the mechanics, of this. I also am unsure about how I can know if it is in my best interests to have a house. Could you elaborate a bit more on just WHAT is actually happening when we change our minds and join with Jesus' love? How does the problem become resolved on the level of form? I do realize form is not the essential thing; that it's the change of mind that matters.",
    "output": "To clarify, it is important in the example of Helen's eyelash, and so in its application to your own life, to appreciate the difference between content and symbol. With Helen, the content was either separating or joining with Jesus' love. And the discomfort of an eyelash in her eye was only the symbol she used at the level of form to represent her decision in her mind to separate from Jesus. The problem was not the eyelash, but the decision to separate. So the solution was to join again with his love. When she did, the eyelash in her eye, which was a projection of the guilt for separating from him, was no longer projected, for the guilt behind it was gone. And so the eyelash appeared to be outside her eye. But Helen's mind, not Jesus, dictated the form of the symbol in both cases and Jesus had nothing to do with anything that was happening to her body. Now if you feel that you are separated from Jesus' love, or as you mention, you have a sense of \"homelessness\" for believing that you have left God, there must also be guilt, for the ego tells us that separation always involves attack. And guilt inevitably leads to fear of retaliation--a very insecure feeling. One form then that you may use to symbolize the separation is to live in an apartment that seems to make you feel insecure. But the apartment itself is not the problem. It is only a symbol for the guilt in your mind. So the solution is not to buy a home but to heal the guilt in your mind over separating from Jesus by joining with him again. Then, if your apartment is only a symbol of your guilt over the separation, your living circumstances may change, although obviously, in the world of form, with its \"laws\" of time and space that we all accept, this relocation would not happen with the speed that Helen's eyelash was relocated from her eye to her cheek. In addition, your living situation is certainly a more complex symbol than Helen's eyelash, possibly representing both ego content and the content of love, and so external shifts will most likely be less direct and immediate. But Jesus would have nothing to do with those changes. Rather, it would be a decision in your own mind to choose a form or symbol that no longer reinforces your own belief in the need to suffer for your sin of separation and to see the source of your insecure feelings as outside yourself. But changing the content in your mind and not the symbol in the world would be your focus. However, if your primary goal is to switch from apartment living to owning your own home, thinking that will help you feel more secure, you will be caught in the ego ploy of believing that something external will provide you with the feelings of safety and peace that you seek. And you will not be addressing the real problem in the mind and so will not be open to the real solution, which is also in the mind (W-pI.79). That is not to say that owning your own home is not a reasonable goal to hold for yourself. It is just that it would be a mistake to believe that this would bring you any kind of lasting happiness or security. As you remember the real problem in the mind--guilt--and its solution--joining with Jesus, or forgiveness--the external circumstances will increasingly be less of a concern to you as you find the peace and security within your own mind. Jesus understands your search for that home of safety and comfort and he certainly must be including you among those he is addressing when he observes, \"We speak today for everyone who walks this world, for he is not at home. He goes uncertainly about in endless search, seeking in darkness what he cannot find; not recognizing what it is he seeks. A thousand homes he makes, yet none contents his restless mind. He does not understand he builds in vain. The home he seeks can not be made by him. There is no substitute for Heaven. All he ever made was hell\" (W-pI.182.3). By the way, if you re-read the section from the excerpt series that you refer to after reading this, you may find that it provides even further clarification to your questions."

    "text_input": "Q #133: If--as A Course in Miracles claims--thinking precedes emotion, such as anger, what about people with epilepsy or Tourette's syndrome who apparently seem to have anger attacks without prior thought, i.e., the reaction seems to be physiological rather than psychological?",
    "output": "The thinking that is always meant in the Course is a function of a mind that is outside time and space. The body, which is comprised of both physiological and psychological dimensions, is a projection of this mind; therefore, all physical and psychological conditions are the result of a choice made by the mind. Mind in the Course is not the brain, nor is it the human mind, as theorists commonly speak of it. In a section in the manual about sickness and healing, Jesus teaches us that sickness is \"a faulty problem-solving approach,\" and as such is a decision made in one's mind. He continues: \"The resistance to recognizing this is enormous, because the existence of the world as you perceive it depends on the body being the decision maker. Terms like 'instincts,' 'reflexes' and the like represent attempts to endow the body with non-mental motivators. Actually, such terms merely state or describe the problem. They do not answer it\" (M-5.II.1:5-10). Generally, the Course's discussion of anger is not aimed at the type generated by epilepsy episodes or Tourette's syndrome. However, those physiological conditions themselves are the outcome of a choice made in the mind, as is true of any disease or disability: \"Sickness is anger taken out upon the body, so that it will suffer pain\" (T-28.VI.5:1). \"Sickness is a defense against the truth\" (W-pI.136). As difficult as this is to accept, it is a source of genuine hope, because by turning to Jesus or the Holy Spirit, we can be helped to look at the pain in our minds, from which all bodily states emanate as maladaptive attempts to defend against the enormity of that pain. Once we are back in touch with our decision-making ability in our minds, we can then make the choice that will restore to our awareness the eternal love and peace in which we were created."

    "output": "Yes, the Sonship includes anything of form. We are so accustomed to using our human experience as a reference point that it seems strange to think of our pets--dogs, cats, snakes, frogs, birds, plants, rocks, etc.--as parts of the Sonship. We would have to step outside our human experience to comprehend it. Jesus alludes to this in speaking of the original separation in the context of the Son making a substitute for the truth: \"You...made but one substitution. It has taken many forms, because it was the substitution of illusion for truth; of fragmentation for wholeness. It has become so splintered and subdivided and divided again, over and over, that it is now almost impossible to perceive it once was one, and still is what it was\" (T-18.I.4:1-3). And in another passage, Jesus refers even to \"the smallest grain of sand\" as part of the Sonship (T- 28.IV.9:4). The perception of qualitative differences is merely part of the ego's strategy to sustain the illusion of separation."

    "text_input": "Q #135: The following four questions all address the issue of suicide and so will be answered together:  : Could you please comment on the Course's view on suicide?  : What is the \"right\" way to cope with suicide, seen through the eyes of A Course in Miracles?  : My grandfather committed suicide. Death, our separation from God--it's all an illusion. So is suicide wrong? Or is it the state of mind--feeling separated from God--while committing suicide that is wrong? What happens if one does commit suicide? Do people automatically become one with God when they are not in the illusion of the world?  : My wife recently committed suicide. She and I were students of A Course in Miracles. Sometimes I wonder, if all this is an illusion, what is the purpose of our staying alive? Why should we struggle with this life that is not part of the real world anyway? What is the purpose of any of this?",
    "output": "From the perspective of the Course, every death is really suicide. For, as Jesus explains, \"No one can die unless he chooses death\" (T-19.IV-C.1:4), and again later, \"And no one dies without his own consent. Nothing occurs but represents your wish, and nothing is omitted that you choose\" (W-pI.152.1:4-5). But the Course also makes it clear that death is a thought in the mind that has nothing to do with the body (e.g., W-pI.163.1:1; W-pI.167.2:1-3). For the ego itself has its origins in an insane but illusory thought of death--the belief that we can attack God in order to wrest a separate individual self from Him. Such a thought represents not only murder--the death of God--but also suicide--the death of our true Self as Christ. And so whatever follows in the world of bodies and behavior from this initial insane thought can be no more real or sane. Because the Course always asks us to focus on content and purpose rather than form and appearance, all death in the world that comes from an ego thought will be viewed in exactly the same light. The ego's purpose in all death is to prove that the separation is real and that, in the end, God triumphs over us by taking back from us the life that we have stolen from Him. We can either resist until we finally succumb to more powerful external forces, or we can resign ourselves to our fate and yield to death by our own hands. What form death may come in then does not matter, for the content is always the same--our puny, painful life is ours only for a limited time before we inevitably must lose it. On the other hand, looking with Jesus or the Holy Spirit, we would see all death, including suicide, as no different in content, but only in form, from every other choice we ever make here in the world that is based on our perception of ourselves as separate and alone, in pain, vulnerable and victimized. And yet we would know that that perception is false, based as it is on a faulty premise about ourselves, that we are this body, trapped in a harsh, cruel world, not of our making, desperately battling against insurmountable odds to find a little peace and happiness in a hopeless situation over which we have no control. From most of the world's perspective, suicide has a stigma and a negative moral judgment associated with it, but that is simply part of the ego's defense which insists that both life as a separate self and death of that self are real. From the Course's perspective, the thought behind suicide, if it is ego-based--Jesus also makes clear that death can be chosen with the guidance of the Holy Spirit (M-12.5; S-3.II)--is a mistake, an error, but that is all. It is not a sin, nor does it entail any negative consequences any different from any other decision we make with the ego as our teacher--they all reinforce the guilt we unconsciously are wanting to keep alive in our mind to prove that the separation is real. And so suicide is no more of a mistake than the mistake we made in choosing to be born into the world. In both cases, we are trying to deal with the problem of the guilt in our mind by focusing on the seemingly external world and our body, guaranteeing that we will not find a solution. We are attempting to solve the problem of separation in the world, as if the world were the problem, rather than in the mind, where the real problem--the insane thought of separation--is buried. And so, whether we commit suicide or we die in any other way, believing that death is real, we will remain trapped in the self-imposed ego belief in separation. Death does not deliver us from the ego thought system, nor from the world that is its defense. Only looking at the ego thought system with the nonjudgmental presence of Jesus or the Holy Spirit beside us and deciding once and for all that the idea of separation holds no value for us can return us to the experience of our oneness with God. For the world is not depriving us of anything--only our choice to be separate is. Even though this world is an illusion, as are our individual lives here--a life we feel is bracketed between birth and death--we don't believe it. If we did, and truly knew the world's purpose was to attack God and therefore our Self, then of course we would never think of ourselves as being in bodies. But the fact that we all live that way--breathing, eating, drinking, recreating, etc.-- proves that while we might intellectually believe what A Course in Miracles tells us, it is certainly not our experience. Therefore, the Holy Spirit's purpose for our being here, once we have been born, is to have us learn His lessons of forgiveness, including the ultimate lesson that death is unreal. The world then becomes a classroom in which we happily learn what He is teaching us. Wanting to leave the world simply reinforces its reality for us. After all, who would want to leave a place unless he first believed it was real and unpleasant. That is why Jesus tells us in the text: \"There is a risk of thinking death is peace\" (T-27.VII.10:2). True peace comes not from leaving the physical world, but only through the practice of forgiveness that undoes the mind's guilt that is the only cause of pain and suffering, as well as the belief in the reality of death. And so, as we are willing, at the pace we choose, we take the small steps of forgiveness that will return us to the glorious eternal Self that we could never destroy, the Self that has remained our Identity despite our foolish digressions into the illusions of death."

    "output": "Jesus uses these words as a comfort to us, correcting our ego belief that God is angry at us and wants to punish us for attacking Him to establish our separate self, torn from the totality of Heaven (T-5.V.3:10-11). Since the Course says over and over again that the separation never happened in reality--that's the Atonement principle--the line you refer to can not be literally true. But what a reassuring thought, while we still believe in separation, to hear not only that God is not seeking vengeance against us, but He misses us and only wants us to come back to Him! If we can allow ourselves to hear that, we can begin to heal the guilt that we have made real in our mind over our supposed assault on Love. You may also wish to refer to #72 in this series for a further discussion of Course language about God, as well as Questions #42 and #85, which discuss the reasons for the metaphorical, dualistic language of the Course."

    "text_input": "Q #137: I would like to understand the following quote from the text: \"In any relationship in which you are wholly willing to accept completion, and only this, there is God completed and His Son with Him\" (T-16.IV.9:6). How do I accept completion? I know that the ego level seeks special relationships. I also know that the preface says we are already \"complete, safe, loved and loving.\" So how do I distinguish the ego's search for completion from the completion referred to in the above quote?",
    "output": "The key to answering your question is to include the preceding sentence: \"In the Name of God, be wholly willing to abandon all illusions. In any relationship in which you are wholly willing to accept completion, and only this, there is God completed, and His Son with Him\" (T- 16.IV.9:5-6). The first sentence speaks of \"illusions,\" which contrasts with the \"completion\" of the second sentence. Briefly stated, the way to completion is by undoing all illusions. It may be helpful to review the basic ego set up: We believe we have separated from God. Consumed with guilt for this \"sin,\" we feel terribly lonely and empty. The ego tells us we can fill the void left by the separation by having all kinds of relationships--with our \"selves,\" other people, events, things, even our thoughts. In other words, we use all illusions in the dream, seeking to find in them a substitute for our truth. This vast array of substitutes is the ego's definition of completion. The problem is the substitutes do not work. That does not stop the ego, however. It insists that if only we find the right combination of perfect substitutes we will find happiness and completion in the dream, thereby succeeding in making a perfect replacement for God and Heaven. When the plan still does not work, the ego tells us keep looking, try again, never mentioning that the real deal is \"Seek but do not find\" (T-16.V.6:5). The pursuit then is endless, which fulfills the ego's purpose of keeping us hopelessly locked in the illusions of the world. This is the driving force behind every special relationship. We use others to meet our needs, and fill the void left by the seeming separation. In other words, seeking completion in illusory substitutions--what the Course calls idols: \"All idols of this world were made to keep the truth within from being known to you, and to maintain allegiance to the dream that you must find what is outside yourself to be complete and happy\" (T-29.VII.6:1). The ego seeks for completion in the external, while the completion the Holy Spirit is leading us to is internal. When we have become sufficiently disillusioned with the world's offerings and the ego's claims, we suspect that there must be another way. We can then look in the right direction (the mind) for our real completion, and begin to let go of our investment in the illusions. If we are dedicated to the process of letting go of all the useless substitutes, we begin to identify less and less with lies of the ego. This is accomplished through the training program the Course offers, which is to remember that we are either experiencing peace or conflict, and that the cause of our experience is nothing external. Rather, it is a choice made in the mind. As peace becomes more appealing than conflict, we will more frequently choose it, until eventually we will choose nothing else, and identify fully with the part of our minds that remembers our truth. When this happens, we \"accept completion.\" In that moment, all of our relationships will be \"blessed\" by this awareness, and we will have joined fully with our truth, which is everyone's truth. God is not literally \"completed\" in this, since obviously He cannot be incomplete. This is the Course's way of saying He will be remembered, and in this sense, brought into our completeness. The important thing is that this requires truly wanting nothing else, and abandoning all illusions. As long as there is one illusion we would interpose between ourselves and our truth we will not know our completion, because by clinging to the illusion we are actively denying the truth about ourselves. Since we do in fact spend great energy in pursuit of our idols, we do well not to judge ourselves for this mistake, but also to keep in mind: \"It is vain to worship idols in the hope of peace. God dwells within, and your completion lies in Him\" (T-29.VII.6:2-3)."

    "text_input": "Q #138: If it is inevitable that we will wake up, or at least remember our true Identity, then behaviorally would it be logical to do whatever one feels is most peaceful in the world? And so in many ways it doesn't really matter what others do or say. In fact, A Course in Miracles itself is quite irrelevant, if the waking process is inevitable. I mean isn't it just a matter of hanging around doing what one likes doing best and not being naive to the fact that the ego will jabber on nonsense regardless of our seemingly worldly activities?",
    "output": "While \"the outcome is as certain as God\" (T-2.III.3:10) and \"the acceptance of the Atonement by everyone is only a matter of time\" (T-2.III.3:1)--simply because we could never really separate ourselves from God--we are still making a deliberate choice right now to remain asleep in our dream of time. And for all of us, the pain of the thought of separation behind the dream will eventually become so intolerable that we will all at some point want to make a different choice, the choice to awaken (T-2.III.3). So the only question any of us needs to ask ourselves now is, how long do I want to remain in pain, asleep in time? If we do not want to be conscious of and accept responsibility for our choice to see ourselves as separate, Jesus tells us we can continue to temporize and procrastinate for a time period at least as long as the time across which the separation has already occurred, that is, \"millions of years\"! (T-2.VIII.2:5). Granted, all of this is illusory, and, from Jesus' perspective outside of time, it matters little: \"Nothing is ever lost but time, which in the end is meaningless. For it is but a little hindrance to eternity, quite meaningless to the real Teacher of the world\" (T-26.V.2:1-2). But Jesus also recognizes that this is not our experience here in time: \"Yet since you do believe in it [time], why should you waste it going nowhere, when it can be used to reach a goal as high as learning can achieve?...it is hard indeed to wander off, alone and miserable, down a road that leads to nothing and that has no purpose\" (T-26.V.2:3,6). So we have a choice about how we want to use time and how long we want to remain in the experience of time. Yes, in the end, it won't matter, for we will have to remember who we really are--that has never really changed. But while we still believe all of this is real, Jesus in his Course is telling us that the length of our time in time can be \"greatly shortened by miracles, the device for shortening but not abolishing time\" (T-2.VIII.2:6). But this means, if the Course is our path, that our relationships with our brothers are of central importance, for it is upon others that each of us has projected all the guilt and responsibility for the pain of separation that we don't want to see within ourselves. And so, as students of the Course, we will care what others do or say, not because we want to change them, but because our reactions to them can direct us to the unhealed places within our own mind. To avoid looking at our reactions to others, dismissing them as irrelevant to our waking process, would be to engage in denial, which is just another way of saying we are refusing to accept responsibility for our own decision to be separate. In the end, we will all see this, but the choice we have now is whether we want to acknowledge any of these projections now. As difficult as looking at our brother to see our own \"secret sins and hidden hates\" (T- 31.VIII.9:2) may seem to be, Jesus wants us to understand that not looking leads to even greater pain, for there is no hope for healing then. And so he encourages us, reminding us that this is a path we take with our brother: \"Think not the way to Heaven's gate is difficult at all. Nothing you undertake with certain purpose and high resolve and happy confidence, holding your brother's hand and keeping step to Heaven's song, is difficult to do\" (T-26.V.2:4-5; italics added). Q#139: I listened to the tape set \"Form vs. Content: Sex and Money.\" It said that you project out from inside your beliefs about money. How do you find out exactly what your beliefs are so that you can change them? A: Before considering how you may identify your beliefs about money, a little clarification of A Course in Miracles approach to all of our ego thoughts and beliefs may be helpful first. We want to become aware of them so that we can accept responsibility for choosing them, but not so that we can change them. That would put us in charge of the process of Atonement, a surefire formula for failure. The goal with the Course is that we make our unconscious thoughts conscious, accept responsibility for choosing them, recognize what purpose they serve in the ego's scheme, and then release them along with the guilt they necessarily entail to the healing light of the Holy Spirit or Jesus. But we don't want to try to change them! For that would make them real and would involve substituting one ego belief for another. Money is simply an external form or symbol onto which we project our beliefs about ourselves. So what are your attitudes and feelings about money? By the way, there are no right or wrong, good or bad, answers to the questions that follow. All answers will reflect basic ego beliefs about yourself and others, of either a special love or special hate nature. In the end, we will realize they are neither right nor wrong, good nor bad, but simply untrue. But we first have to look at them, because we do believe them, and look with Jesus or the Holy Spirit beside us so that we can look openly and honestly. Do you feel you never have enough? Are you afraid of losing the money you have? Does having money make you feel better or more secure about yourself? Do you save it as a symbol of security and safety against unforeseen dangers and obstacles? Or do you tend to spend it as quickly as you get it and are always in debt? Do you see having money as a symbol of status and success, a measure of your worth? If you don't have much money, do you try to pretend you have more? Or do you wear your poverty as a badge of specialness? If you have lots of money, do you like to flaunt it? Or do you try to keep a low profile about it? How do you feel about sharing your money with others or giving it away? Are you jealous or resentful of those who have more money than you? How do you feel your parents have been towards you with money? If you are in a relationship with someone else which involves joint management of money and resources, is there conflict around handling it? What is the nature of the disagreements you have and what judgments do you find yourself making about how the other handles money? As you reflect on your answers to these and other related questions about money that may come to mind, you want then to get in touch with the underlying thoughts, feelings and beliefs that these represent. These may be thoughts and feelings of inadequacy, scarcity, deprivation, limitation, insecurity, fear, victimization, irresponsibility, shame and guilt, pride, triumph, superiority, generosity, power, control, and so on. The important recognition that you want to foster is that these are basic feelings about yourself that have nothing to do with money, or other people, or anything of the world. These are repercussions from seriously entertaining the thought of separation in your mind and wanting it to be true. For the thought of separation is nothing less than the desire to be separate from love, including a willingness to attack and destroy love in order to establish an individual self. And in that process we believe we have destroyed our own value. And so all of the accompanying feelings of worthlessness, which become too painful to hold in our mind and acknowledge, become projected out onto a world of our own making, with many convenient targets and repositories for those feelings, including money. And then those external symbols seem to be the problem, rather than the thought of separation in our mind through which we devalued our true Self. At that point, the ego thought system is well protected from the Holy Spirit's Atonement principle, which says separation is impossible except in illusory dreams and nothing has really happened to deprive us of the love that we are. But once we understand the ego's purpose for the world, including money, we can look at all of it differently, and know it is a window to our own unconscious mind. And now we can make a different choice, remembering our true Value as God's holy Son."

    "text_input": "Q #140: I have been studying A Course in Miracles for a few years now and I am aware of the importance of the practice of asking for help. I am also aware of wanting and needing help. Whenever I attempt to ask for help, however, I become aware of the strong specialness component to my asking. For example I am now teaching again after many years of doing something entirely different. I am nervous about doing the job well, and try to ask for help so that I will be able to do a good job but am aware that the main reason for asking is that I want to be special both to my students and superiors. I try to talk to Jesus about this issue but have a lot of difficulty with talking to him and wonder how important it is to be able to have complete conversations with him. They usually seem to evaporate--maybe I don't really trust that he is there. I would appreciate any suggestions that you have in dealing with this block that I have to this essential tool of the Course.",
    "output": "First of all, you should acknowledge yourself for recognizing the specialness thoughts that are behind your requests for help. That is a very big step. And then don't try to change them. Just allow yourself to see where they are coming from--a concept of an inadequate self that feels it needs to enhance its status by projecting a good image. It's pretty clear which voice is speaking at that point. But if you can watch yourself doing this without judging yourself, then you are looking with Jesus at your ego, and this is the kind of help that he wants us to ask from him. In our beginning practice with the Course, we usually want to ask Jesus for help with specific problems and concerns in our lives and this is only natural. That kind of asking can be helpful in developing a positive relationship with Jesus in our mind, no longer seeing him as the angry Judge who will call us to account for ourselves on the Day of Reckoning, as traditional Christianity portrays him. But you are already beginning to see the limitations of this kind of asking--it is fueled by a desire for specialness. That is a major insight and it can help you get more in touch with the genuine help that Jesus is holding out to us--a help that allows us to look at the limitations we believe about ourselves without judging ourselves or feeling guilty about those thoughts, so that we can look beyond them to the truth about ourselves. The first section in The Song of Prayer addresses the steps we take up \"the ladder of prayer\" as we progress in our practice of asking for help (S-1.II). So your conversations with Jesus will change over time, and what you bring to him will shift as you grow into the teachings of the Course. Your present difficulty in sustaining your focus on him is simply a reflection of your fear of him and what he represents, for a part of you knows that he is leading you beyond your ego and the special self you are so identified with. You may find it helpful to dialogue with Jesus by writing down your thoughts as if in conversation with him, addressing him very specifically about what is on your mind and asking him in the process for help in recognizing the purpose behind your thoughts and how to uncover them without reinforcing the guilt in your mind. The process of writing may be helpful in maintaining your focus and exposing your ego thoughts, especially as you become more familiar and comfortable with the process. You may even want to keep the writing as a journal so that you can refer back to helpful conversations when the fear level becomes too high and you can't remember what you already know--a common experience when our ego feels threatened. What is most important is not to become overly concerned about your resistance--it is to be expected. Acknowledging it without fighting it will allow it to dissolve in your mind over time."

It seems like others can move through this journey with ease: they light a few candles, do some yoga, say a chant or two, and they're in bliss central, while I find myself in a scary Godzilla movie. I get centered and the fear goes away; but then it returns, again and again. It seems to be a long movie. But the Course is set up for a year. Will there ever be an ending to all this (like before my death) or maybe just an intermission? Any input will be very much appreciated.",
    "output": "No, it is not an easy journey, and you echo the sighs of many other students. Sometimes we just have to lighten up and learn how to sit back and enjoy the show. It is, after all, the undoing of what never happened. It doesn't feel like that, for sure; but we are simply choosing to watch reruns of the same old movie. When we are less afraid to approach the whole thing that way, and have not yielded to the temptation to deny our feelings, our internal experience will change for the better. We cannot judge where we are in the process, or where anyone else is either; time is part of the ego's trick to keep us clothed in our false identities. And the sin, guilt, and fear that have turned our minds into torture chambers which we vowed never to go near again, are just silly thoughts that we have invested with tremendous power. We would do well to accept Jesus' invitation to share his vision in seeing the seeming power of our egos as \"not strong enough to stop a button's fall, nor hold a feather\" (T-18.IX.6:4). Just keep the faith! \"Have faith in only this one thing, and it will be sufficient: God wills you be in Heaven, and nothing can keep you from it, or it from you. Your wildest misperceptions, your weird imaginings, your blackest nightmares all mean nothing. They will not prevail against the peace God wills for you\" (T-13.XI.7:1-3). The only power Godzilla has is the power you give to him. He can be a monster or, like the Wizard of Oz, a cute little thing using amplifiers to convince you that he is something to be feared. It is your choice, and you probably know which choice Jesus would support. This would be the intermission. \"But the outcome is as certain as God\" (T-2.III.3:10). One final point: When we have completed the 365 lessons, we think we have finally \"done the Course,\" only to read the first line in the Epilogue: \"This course is a beginning, not an end\" (W- pII.ep.1:1). It is not set up as simply a one-year course, therefore. When we begin to \"get it\"; that is, when we begin to see clearly where it is leading us, we dig in our heels usually, and then settle in for a very long journey, but only because we are too frightened to let go of our ego all at once in a given instant. It is a process that will take as long as we need it to take."

Even ardently repeating a maxim like \"I am not a body. I am free. For I am still as God created me\" (W-pI.rVI.in.3:3-5) during an attack seems quite ineffective. Is it basically still a very fearful subconscious that is at the bottom of this, or is it the ego taking me for a ride and having me believe that I have forgiven myself more than I really have?",
    "output": "You're trying so very hard, but you also want to be gentle and patient with yourself. It would be helpful not to try to evaluate your progress based on any feedback you feel your body is giving you. Aches and pains always reveal unhealed areas in the mind, and in that sense it is helpful to pay attention to them, but not as a yardstick against which to judge how well you are practicing forgiveness and whether you are passing or failing the Course. Yes, there is still fear, as well as guilt, buried in your subconscious mind, and yes, your ego will always want to fool you about your progress, but also your lack of progress (T-18.V.1:5-6). All of that is to be expected while you still identify yourself as the body which has the name you answer to. For seeing yourself as a body means you still believe that the separation and its accompanying guilt are real and you still believe you need a defense against that guilt, which is the purpose the body serves. The pain, apparently in the body, is intended to distract you from its real source in the mind. So if you are willing to make the connection back to the mind and see the cause--unforgiveness--that is all you really need do. If there is a pain killer that seems to be helpful in relieving your pain, by all means continue to use it. So what if it is not the ultimate healing? Know that Jesus is not judging you for what you may see as your weakness and inability to forgive completely. Taking medication is a gentler and more loving way of dealing with your pain than trying to persuade yourself that the pain is not real by using words from the Course as affirmations to shout down the ego and cover over what you still believe about yourself--that you are a body. It will always be more helpful simply to get in touch with what you still believe and why, knowing, as you suggest, that it is only fear that holds you in those beliefs. By acknowledging and looking at the fear, you will be doing your part in its healing. For a further consideration of issues related to the questions you raise, you may wish to look at #128."

    "text_input": "Q #143: I know that A Course in Miracles is not aimed at the level of behavior and it indicates that depression is an attempt to attack God. Therefore, I have been angry with myself for being depressed about the war with Iraq, thinking that I should be \"above\" that. Was it wrong that I had hoped that peace would prevail on a physical level? Is it an indication of my specialness that I am depressed that it hasn't?",
    "output": "It is quite normal to hope that peace would prevail on a physical level; and many other people have also felt depressed about the war and about the world situation in general. The only mistake you are making is being angry with yourself and thinking that you should be beyond depression. In connecting depression with blasphemy (T-10.V), Jesus is calling our attention, in a dramatic way, to the effects in our minds of giving our allegiance to the ego (specifically the god of sickness), rather than to his healing love. When you become depressed, all that you have done is identify with your ego's view of things. But, more than likely, you identify with the ego in many other ways throughout the day. So why would you be surprised by this form? It is easy to forget that simply feeling scared when your supply of oxygen is cut off is an ego reaction. We have ego reactions all the time, and it is a mistake to have a hierarchy among them. Any time you are tempted to judge yourself by feeling you should be beyond a, b, or c, you should stop right there and remind yourself that that judgment is coming from your ego, and therefore should not be taken seriously. In his kind and gentle guidance of us, Jesus would never utter those words of judgment. Wanting there to be peace in the world is quite normal, to repeat; but it can also be viewed in the context of your special relationship with your identity as an individual in \"your\" world. In this sense, your identity as an individual would be more secure and less problematic if there were no conflicts in the world. The impatience and depression about the turmoil might be reminding you of the profound insecurity you feel on a deep level, because, somewhere in your mind, you know that your existence as an individual is not authentic. In your wrong/ego mind you believe (as we all do) that your existence came at God's expense. A world without major upheavals thus can be a defense against that insecurity, which is always present in the mind that believes it has separated from God. Also, since we are the ones who made the world to replace our true home in Heaven--thereby saying that we could get along without God just fine--then when the world \"doesn't work right,\" we would feel as if we had failed. Depression would be one response to that sense of failure, for once again we have been reminded that we have denied God (blasphemy). On the other hand, for some people, being preoccupied with the chaos and strife in the world protects them from having to deal with the chaos and strife in their minds. But this defense, as is the case with all defenses, reinforces their unconscious guilt, because they would then want there to be calamities in the world to serve their own need for protection from their minds. The good news that Jesus imparts to us in the Course is that true peace is not dependent on anything external in order to be what it is. He helps us realize that peace in the world, even it were achieved, would always be a fragile peace, and therefore would not bring us the comfort we long for. It would depend on the presence of specific conditions, and it would require guardians, or a \"peace-keeping force,\" as governments typically describe them. The peace of mind that Jesus offers us is simply restored to us; it is not something we must earn. And, thankfully, it is restored simply by our choosing against the interferences to its presence, which means that we must first become aware of how we interfere with it, and how we defend against it. This would be our own personal \"peace-keeping force\"--our ongoing vigilance for our attacks against our Self. Once these interferences are gone, peace will flow through us naturally, but we then would have no investment in how it is extended, or whether it is received by others when offered."

    "text_input": "Q #144: How would one deal with anxiety from the perspective of A Course in Miracles? If you've used cognitive behavioral techniques to deal with feelings of anxiety, and you've looked at your anxiety from a psychotherapeutic angle, and you also approach it as a student with the Course's principles but still find yourself anxious in a particular situation, what are you doing wrong?",
    "output": "You don't say how specifically you have approached your anxiety using the Course's principles. But the fact that you are continuing to feel anxiety does not mean that you are doing anything wrong other than continuing to identify with your ego thought system. Maintaining a false separate identity is very anxiety-producing as we have set it up in our mind. The Course refers to the source of anxiety in several passages: \"When you are anxious, realize that anxiety comes from the capriciousness of the ego\" (T-4.IV.4:1). \"The ingeniousness of the ego to preserve itself is enormous, but it stems from the very power of the mind the ego denies. This means that the ego attacks what is preserving it, which must result in extreme anxiety\" (T- 7.VI.3:1-2). \"And if you do distort reality you will experience anxiety, depression and ultimately panic, because you are trying to make yourself unreal\" (T-9.I.14:4). By establishing a false ego self, we believe we have set ourselves up in opposition to God, Whom we perceive as an insurmountable force Who will in the end seize back what we have stolen from Him--our separate, individual existence. So trying to maintain that identity has to arouse intense anxiety. You also don't say what the particular anxiety-arousing situation is, but it must be a symbol in your mind for the separation, which means that it is a situation in which you are perceiving your interests as separate from, and so in competition with, others. It does not matter who you perceive as right or justified in the situation, the fact that you're not recognizing your shared interests at a deeper level with everyone else in the situation is the source of the anxiety. For it is a reminder of your initial attack on God, when you perceived your interests as separate from His. The first step in dealing with your anxiety is to recognize that you have displaced this existential anxiety on to an external situation so that you do not remember its source in the mind, where you could do something about it. Jesus points out how we deceive ourselves: \"Even if he is fully aware of anxiety he does not perceive its source as his own ego identification, and he always tries to handle it by making some sort of insane 'arrangement' with the world. He always perceives this world as outside himself, for this is crucial to his adjustment. He does not realize that he makes this world, for there is no world outside of him\" (T-12.III.6:5-7). Once we return our focus from the outer to the inner, where Jesus or the Holy Spirit are waiting for us, we can ask for Their help in seeing the real source of anxiety--the belief in separation-- differently. By joining with Them and asking for Their help, we have moved beyond separate interests. For we are now joined with their love, which reminds us that the Love of God that we thought we had attacked and destroyed remains unchanged and available in our mind."

    "text_input": "Q #145: In answering #74, the statement was made that \"either we have chosen to reinforce our belief in separation or to undo this belief, and there is never an instant when we are not making this choice.\" It is really difficult to deal with a decision you have made when you don't even know what it is you have done. What is a simple way of knowing that we are making the choice to undo separation?",
    "output": "If you are perceiving another's interests as the same as yours, you are undoing the separation. If you respect another person's choice for the ego, do not take his attacks personally, and see only a call for help mirroring your own, you are undoing the separation. If you would rather be happy than right, you are undoing the separation. In most cases, though, it is easier to recognize when we are upholding the separation, because that is what we do most of the time. For example, it is almost second nature to us to perceive other people's interests and goals as clashing with ours, as it is almost second nature to us to get upset over what other people are doing, and then oppose them and try to get them to \"see the error of their ways.\" We are right and they are wrong! So when we don't see another's interests as separate from our own, when we don't take sides, when we don't oppose, we are undoing the separation. We are speaking here, though, only about what takes place in one's mind. We are not talking about behavior. Perceiving others' interests as the same as ours means recognizing that we all share the same insanity (the wrong mind) and the same sanity (the right mind). The forms become irrelevant. We all share the same hell of the ego, and we all share the same longing to go home and be met with love not punishment. We think we truly want to get beyond all thoughts of separation and return to our home in Heaven; but our fear of totally undoing our belief in separation is far more intense than we normally realize, because on a deep level we know that to undo the separation is to undo the individual identity we work so hard to sustain. Most students experience strong resistance to letting go, as witnessed to by the recurrence of grievances and conflict. By not judging ourselves for these thoughts, and being more and more consistent in bringing them to the love of Jesus in our right minds, we gradually undo the guilt that is the source of our perceptions of ourselves and others."

    "text_input": "Q #146: I have been a student of A Course in Miracles for a little over a year. I thought I had only loving feelings towards Jesus, and therefore I have been perplexed about another part of me that seems to be fearful of Jesus' love and closeness--especially since my goal of being a student of the Course is to join with him and practice forgiveness. Also, I was thinking that since the decision making part of my mind had already decided there must be another way (i.e., choose Jesus as my teacher instead of the ego), why would part of my mind now tell Jesus to stay away from me and not to hurt me? Can you help me understand this?",
    "output": "This is a good example of the split mind spoken of in the Course. One part is sane, reflecting Heaven's love; the other part is insane, filled with the hatred of the ego. We all--as part of the one Son of God--have both parts, and our decision maker is always choosing one or the other. Jesus reminds us time and time again in the Course that there are only these two choices open to us. We can usually tell by our experience whether we have chosen the ego or the Holy Spirit as our teacher, but we are generally not consciously aware of making the choice. Jesus teaches us, however, that even though our decisions seem to take place out of our awareness, that really is not what happens. See for example, Lesson 136, paragraphs 3-5. While other factors may be responsible for the fear in individual cases, in general we can say that the ego part of our minds would have to be intensely afraid of Jesus and also hate him because of what he represents. What sustains the ego is guilt, and therefore someone such as Jesus who represents the end of guilt would be hated and feared. Thus, \"To the ego, the guiltless are guilty\" (T-13.II.4:2). Jesus represents the end of our identity as an ego, so to the extent to which we identify with our egos, we will fear and hate him. Of course that is not our total identity, but that is what we must learn, and what Jesus goes to great lengths to teach us. So until we can let go of our identification with the thought system of the ego, we will want to keep Jesus at a safe distance, at the very least, and at other times we will experience outright hatred of him. The idea is not to feel guilty about this fear and hatred, but to understand where it is coming from, so that we can give ourselves a chance to make a different choice. Jesus already knows about it, which is why he asks us in the Course to forgive him (T-19.IV-B.6) and why he talks about the \"bitter idols [that] have been made of him who would be only brother to the world\" (C-5.5:7). We project our own guilt on to him and give him our own ego-based traits. This is largely the image of Jesus portrayed in biblical Christianity. But in essence, the true Jesus, the Jesus of A Course in Miracles, stands for the opposite of everything we are--as egos. That engenders tremendous conflict in our relationship with him. We both love him and are drawn to him, but we also fear him and would rather he be more like us so that we do not have to change. The only mistake we can make is to deny these \"blasphemous\" (to the ego) thoughts and hide them, and then attempt to replace them with lovely, beautiful thoughts of our dear sweet Jesus. This defense will never work; it will lead only to further guilt, which will lead to an endless cycle of projection and attack. The most helpful approach is to look calmly at these thoughts, not be horrified by them or ashamed of them, and bring them to the true Jesus in our right minds. He will lovingly and gently teach us where they came from, and help us distinguish clearly between the gifts the ego offers us and the gifts he offers us."

    "text_input": "Q #147: How can I approach Jesus to bring peace to someone else's troubled, fearful, restless mind while not being able to practically communicate with this other person (either verbally or otherwise)? Is it at all possible, because it is often (to put it mildly) hard enough to bring peace to one's own mind?",
    "output": "Since A Course in Miracles tells us that peace is the result of choosing to identify with the Holy Spirit or Jesus in our minds, it is not really possible to ask Jesus to bring peace to someone's mind (M-5.III.1:1-3; 3:6). Moreover, Jesus does not bring peace to our own minds. The Course teaches that a lack of peace is the result of having made a choice in the mind to identify with the ego thought system in some way. This results in a feeling of guilt, which replaces peace in our awareness. This person's fearful, restless mind is calling for help. To be helpful to them, we must first recognize that this is the choice they have made, and acknowledge the ability of their mind to choose differently. We then review our own mind for any judgments we are holding against this person, and any disquiet we may be experiencing, thus recognizing our own need for healing. Our \"prayer\" for someone else begins with our asking the Holy Spirit or Jesus for help in letting go of our judgments and misperceptions about ourselves and the other person. This is because if we perceive another person as in need, or lacking peace, we have first perceived this lack in ourselves, as you point out. If we do let go of our misperceptions and accept the Holy Spirit's correction, we will experience peace. The peace in our mind is then extended throughout the Sonship; it joins with the peace that is present in everyone's mind, whether or not they choose to be aware of it. This is the process by which we \"offer\" peace to a brother. The real action is always in our own mind. There is no need to communicate externally with the other person. By choosing peace ourselves, we are a reminder of the peace that is theirs, but neither we nor Jesus can choose for someone else, as He tells us: \"I cannot choose for you [or someone else], but I can help you make your own right choice\" (T-3.IV.7:11). Once we have allowed the Holy Spirit's thoughts to replace ours, he will guide us to act in a way that would be loving toward this person, or not to act at all. This will be the under the guidance of the Holy Spirit if we have in fact done our own \"homework,\" as outlined above. This is how we can live the following prayer from the text, which holds the answer to your quest for peace as well as your friend's: \"I desire this holy instant for myself, that I may share it with my brother, whom I love. It is not possible that I can have it without him, or he without me. Yet it is wholly possible for us to share it now. And so I choose this instant as the one to offer to the Holy Spirit, that His blessing may descend on us, and keep us both in peace\" (T-18.V.7:3-6)."

    "text_input": "Q #148: If we were all in a state of Oneness with God how could we have had the thought of separation in that \"tiny, mad moment\"? What would have possessed us to leave that oneness which was peace and bliss? And how could it have happened? What was the scenario do you think?",
    "output": "This is the \"famous\" question. It is famous because it is the most frequently asked question of students of A Course in Miracles (please see #10). The \"famous\" answer is that it is not really a question, but a statement that the separation did in fact occur (C-in.4; see also The Most Commonly Asked Questions About A Course in Miracles, Kenneth Wapnick, pp.17-22)--that is the assumption behind the question. The Course teaches us that the separation never did occur. In fact, it is impossible for the Son to separate from the Father. With this as the starting point, the Course goes on, at great length, to explain how we \"got here,\" since we believe we are here. The explanation it gives us is a kind of myth, explaining something that could never happen. It tells us that the Son of God fell asleep, and dreamed a dream of separation: \"You are at home in God, dreaming of exile but perfectly capable of awakening to reality\" (T-10.I.2:1). Our experience as bodies in the world is a dream. Nothing has happened, and we are in truth still at Home in God. What A Course in Miracles tells us \"happened\" in the mind of the sleeping Son is a wish for more than everything: \"No one who comes here but must still have hope, some lingering illusion, or some dream that there is something outside of himself that will bring happiness and peace to him. If everything is in him this cannot be so. And therefore by his coming, he denies the truth about himself, and seeks for something more than everything, as if a part of it were separated off and found where all the rest of it is not\" (T-29.VII.2:1-3). Enticed by the \"rush\" of being autonomous individuals, thinking this will bring a happiness beyond the \"peace and bliss\" you mention, the Son chooses this thought of being separated from his Source. Although this seems to have occurred millions of years ago in some distant forgotten past, it is actually occurring instant by instant each time the choice is made to believe the separation is real. This is the only \"explanation\" for how we seem to be here, so real, so \"alive,\" so identified with bodies. It is a choice, and the Course tells us this choice is purposeful. It establishes our separate identities, which we have learned to prefer to the truth of who we are. We prefer this made up identity because we very mistakenly believe this will give us happiness. We have convinced ourselves that the ego is right and God is wrong about who we are. Clinging to this belief keeps the separation \"alive and well\" in our minds. This is what makes it happen, over and over in our minds. Again, the thought that drives us is that autonomy is better that unity, God is not enough, and the ego will give us the \"more\" that we seek. In summary, the foundation of the Course's teaching rests on this very important recognition of the power of the mind to choose. We are told that we chose wrongly by choosing to believe the separation occurred, and we are urged to \"choose once again\" (T-31.VIII). In every situation where we find ourselves in conflict, pain or uneasiness we find the opportunity to question our experience in the light of this teaching and choose again: \"The images you make cannot prevail against what God Himself would have you be. Be never fearful of temptation, then, but see it as it is; another chance to choose again ... \" (T-31.VIII.4:1-2)."

    "text_input": "Q #149: If one is terribly ill and in pain with cancer and, as a student of A Course in Miracles, strives to have the Holy Spirit help with forgiveness and peace in the matter, but still suffers physically, what does this mean? The Course indicates that when our mind is healed we will feel no pain.",
    "output": "You already know the answer to your question! When our mind is healed, we will feel no pain. Until our mind is healed, we will feel pain. And because our mind is not healed, we will experience pain as if it were in the body, caused by factors outside of our control, rather than recognizing that it is in the mind that has thought it could separate itself from love--a very painful state. And that is how we protect the thought of separation in our split mind. We use pain to convince ourselves that the body is real, for we still want the body to be real. Jesus tells us: \"Pain is a wrong perspective. When it is experienced in any form, it is a proof of self-deception ... Pain is but witness to the Son's mistakes in what he thinks he is ... The body is the Son of God, corruptible in death ... \" (W-pI.190.1:1-2; 2:3; 3:7). What is most important though is that, while we continue to experience pain--whether it's the pain of cancer or the pain of a broken leg or the pain of emotional abuse or any other form of pain we experience--we do not judge ourselves for feeling it. That would serve no purpose but the ego's. Because of our fear of losing ourselves, we heal the pain in our mind through forgiveness in small steps. And in those moments when we accept that we do not know the truth about ourselves but there is a Comforter Who does, with Whom we are always joined in perfect peace and joy, then the seemingly painful concerns of the body will fade from our awareness. Because of our fear, we will most likely not be ready to embrace fully the healing in the mind and release our limited bodily identity, and so we will turn again back to pain for the defense that it provides. But with each moment of recognition, shared in the holy instant of healing, our investment in guilt and pain will diminish. And we will never again be totally convinced that the world, or anything outside our mind, can cause us pain. For a consideration of some other issues related to the question you raise, you may also wish to look at #142."

    "text_input": "Q #150: I attacked someone but the next day I imploringly asked for forgiveness and truly forgave all that had hurt me and made me attack. Since then, however, because of the attack, the other person has broken off all communication. I have tried to renew it but without success. Keeping in mind that it was my attack in the first place that brought this situation about, how can I look at it with Jesus and regain my peace of mind? Obviously I have caused irrevocable pain.",
    "output": "You may first want to begin by looking at the thought that you have caused \"irrevocable pain.\" Believe it or not, it is arrogant to claim such power for yourself. You may have reinforced a perception of pain that your friend already held, but you can not be the cause of it. To believe that you could is to deny the power of your friend's mind to choose its experiences, and to see your mind as more powerful. And that is the arrogance. This is not to say that you may not have been unkind, even cruel, in your attack. But none of us can feel attacked unless we want to feel attacked (T-28.VI.4:3-7). And we all want to feel attacked so that the guilt we carry in our own mind over the separation--believing we have attacked and destroyed God (another arrogant thought!)--can be projected on to someone else. The pain is already there in each of our own minds, by our own choice, caused by our own thoughts (W-pI.190.5:1-5). When we think we feel pain over someone else's attack, the pain that has always been there in our mind is just brought to the surface so that we can attribute it to someone else--always the ego's goal. So, in genuine humility, let yourself off the hook for how your friend feels. If you can recognize that this friend simply shares the same ego-based thought system that you do, and that you both have been calling out for the help that only forgiveness can offer, then you can become a reminder to your friend that you both have the same choice to see the situation differently. And that is all that you need to do. That recognition in your mind reinforces the power of decision in your friend's mind to make a different choice about how to perceive the situation. Whether you at this point say or do anything else with your friend will not be your concern. Nor will your friend's readiness to accept what you are offering be your concern. For you will have placed the Holy Spirit in charge of the forgiveness process, knowing that whatever is needed for healing has already been provided."

If there is only Divine Mind of God, shared with all of creation; then how does the responder explain the limitation of Divine Mind within the use of man in the co-creation of his world of form? I believe that each of us uses this Divine Mind though its potency or efficacy is not as great if left untainted by our ego insane applications. A Course in Miracles is a work which cannot be strictly taken in singular quotes; as it is a conversation of the Lord attempting to raise the level of the mind (now dualistic) into a singular higher divine aspect with the assistance of the Holy Spirit so the minds fullest potential can be realized while it still exists on this plane. God, knowing that it was unreal and non-threatening to His Kingdom, allowed His Sons the lessons of miscreation so that wisdom and knowledge could achieve more prudent activities within their growth and return home.",
    "output": "The Course makes it clear throughout that anything of form could not come from God, and therefore must be illusory. God creates only like Himself, which is not something we can understand in our separated state. All of the references in the Course to co-creation pertain to Heaven. This is also true of the term creations. \"There is no life outside Heaven. Where God created life, there life must be. In any state apart from Heaven life is illusion. At best it seems like life; at worst, like death ... Life not in Heaven is impossible, and what is not in Heaven is not anywhere. Outside of Heaven, only the conflict of illusion stands; senseless, impossible and beyond all reason, and yet perceived as an eternal barrier to Heaven. Illusions are but forms. Their content is never true (T-23.II.19).\" Jesus' purpose in the Course is help us get in touch with the part of our minds that is deliberately choosing to reject and deny our true Identity, replace It with a false identity, and then project the responsibility for this onto others in our lives whom we perceive as victimizing us. This has nothing to do with the Divine Mind, Who knows nothing of this journey into madness. You need not agree with what the Course teaches about the Divine Mind, a term that actually never appears in the Course. Its purpose is to lead us back home to God, and if you resonate more with the way another system presents this journey, then that is the path you should follow. We are all children of one Father."

    "text_input": "Q #152: The following answers are in response to different questions posed by the same person. : In a few places in the text and in the lessons, Jesus says that we will \"dissolve into God\" at the end of time. To be straight up, I don't like the idea of dissolving into God. I know that this is my ego speaking for me, and I accept that we are just dreaming this whole thing, that I have already dissolved into God, and I must not have gone away, because I'm still here, so to speak. Yet in my heart of hearts, I'm really afraid of loosing everything when I stop dreaming. This is probably the reason I have not stopped the dream. I understand that Jesus and the Holy Spirit are gently awakening me through Atonement and this feels right. Yet, \"dissolving into God\" feels, sounds, like going into nothingness. Can you help me with my fear?",
    "output": "Most people who practice the Course feel the way you do. They are afraid that \"disappearing into the Heart of God\" means oblivion and nothingness. Feeling this way is quite normal; and you don't want to try to talk yourself out of it. That being said, though, it is obvious that it could only be the ego voicing its own fear of extinction in the presence of love, however. Therefore, when we identify with the ego--which we do whenever we value our individual existence--we definitely will fear our return to the Oneness of Heaven. But Jesus is aware of our dilemma-- though it is a false dilemma--and so he reassures us in many, many places in the Course that we will awaken from this nightmare dream only when we are ready to. It is a process that is mindful of our fear and moves in accord with our readiness. As you have recognized, his is a gentle, comforting approach: \"Fear not that you will be abruptly lifted up and hurled into reality\" (T- 16.VI.8:1; see also T-27.VIII.13). There is an interim stage before we awaken in which we continue our lives here, but with less guilt, less anxiety, less anger, etc. We become more and more comfortable with a different way of being here, as we learn that we feel better when we forgive than when we are boiling inside with hatred and grievances and the pain of competing interests and goals. We gradually let go of our identification with the values the ego has held out to us and identify instead with the values of forgiveness that Jesus holds out to us. In other words, it is not that we lose our self and then just disappear; but rather, we shift in what we choose to identify with, and then that is what we become. This process could be likened to a journey with many planned stops, but no exact timetable. You stop at various places along the way and get used to the new climate and vista. And as you continue the journey, you get to know your tour guide better and become more at ease with him. He never forces you to leave a place you don't really want to leave, and stays there with you until you are ready to move on. He has no timetable that he makes you adhere to. When he tells you that the next stop will be even better, you more than likely would choose to continue the journey because everything he has shown you so far has been rather nice. Your trust in your guide grows, even though sometimes you get annoyed because he rouses you out of bed too early in the morning; but then you realize he did it only because he couldn't wait to get on the road and show you the next beautiful place. The ride is often bumpy, but you forget about that once you are comfortably settled in at your next stop. You even begin to think that your guide actually knows you well and that he knows exactly what will you make you happy. That is the way Jesus leads us. He knows that we will not lose anything and that we will be happier than we ever thought possible when we complete the journey with him; but he also sees how frightened we are of plunging into what we think is the unknown and our certain oblivion. So he gently takes us by the hand and patiently lets us go at our own pace, assuring us again and again that we will lose nothing and regain everything. Until that is our own perception, we can stay wherever we are, and know that Jesus is loving us at every instant. We cannot experience the fullness of that love, though, because we are still resisting it out of fear. But we will experience as much of his love as we let in. Time is illusory, so how long this takes is irrelevant. Jesus' love is not conditional on time or place. #152 (ii): According to A Course in Miracles, does the world and all that I love in it disappear when I awaken from the dream? I ask because I don't see life only as the source of sin, guilt, and fear. I would not want to lose the memories of loved ones and the moments of beauty, courage, creativity, etc., that I've known in my existence, illusory as it might be. A: When we awaken from our nocturnal dreams, we usually forget what we dreamt about, because we know \"it was just a dream.\" The same thing will be true when we awaken from the dream of our lives as individuals apart from God and Heaven. Preceding this awakening, of course, will be a period in which we experience ourselves as the dreamer of the dream, and we will recognize that all bodily existence, including our own, amounts to nothing but figures in the dream. We will know that we are not our bodies, nor are our loved ones their bodies, and that we are all joined now on another level that reflects our true Identity. Our attraction then will be to the radiant beauty of our sinlessness as God's Son. The love in which we are all joined and which transcends anything that could be experienced on a bodily level would totally fill our minds. Nothing else would be in our awareness, for we would have gladly let go of whatever had blocked love's presence from our awareness."

    "text_input": "Q #153: In \"To Be Or Not To Be: Death Leaves Not Its Source\" Ken stated that we all attempt to cheat death in various ways, only to preserve our individuality. Within the illusion, doesn't reincarnation do the same thing? We \"live,\" we \"die,\" only to \"live\" again, just to keep the ego alive and well. At some point we must choose the right-minded tape ... Could you please comment on this.",
    "output": "Yes, reincarnation preserves our individuality, as well as the illusion of time. However, the purpose of multiple reincarnations--as traditionally defined in the different systems--is to have as many opportunities as are needed to complete one's learning, so that the cycle of birth and death may be ended permanently. In A Course in Miracles, as you probably know, Jesus states that \"in the ultimate sense, reincarnation is impossible. There is no past or future, and the idea of birth into a body has no meaning either once or many times. Reincarnation cannot, then, be true in any real sense. Our only question should be, 'Is the concept helpful?'\" (M-24.1:1-4). And in the discussion that follows, he concludes that any belief that leads to progress in accepting the Atonement for ourselves should be honored (M-24.6). Thus it comes down to form and content."

    "text_input": "Q #154: After studying A Course in Miracles for 4 years, I am currently volunteering for a Catholic organization in the Philippines, living in a small religious community and working in the slums of Manila. I was conscious of the differences between the teachings of the Course and Christian Catholicism before going to Manila, from reading Ken Wapnick's A Course in Miracles and Christianity: A Dialogue and Forgiveness & Jesus. However my desire to join this Christian organization was strong and I thought that it would not prevent me from studying the Course and applying its principles on my own. However, I find that I am getting more and more disturbed by joining the prayers or readings when it is proclaimed that Jesus suffered and died for our sins, etc. Even though the teachings are so different, I don't want to use the Course to separate myself from the Christians, and I am asking you how is it possible to be faithful to the Course and to my community and avoid compromise?",
    "output": "You have placed yourself in a very challenging situation, but one in which, if you are willing, there is much you can learn on your path of forgiveness. If you can remember that the Course is only concerned about content or purpose and not form or ritual, you can use your circumstances to deepen your understanding and practice of the Course's principles. It is only your ego that would want to make the differences in beliefs and practices a matter of judgment in order to separate yourself from the rest of your community. You are already aware of this temptation in yourself, and that is very helpful, for that is an obstacle within your mind to the experience of the love that is already present within you. You can respect your friends' choices for their spiritual path without having to accept and embrace those beliefs for yourself. At the same time, since the Course's focus is only on your own inner thoughts and beliefs, there is no reason that you can't ask for the Holy Spirit's help in using all those rituals and forms in which you are expected to participate simply as opportunities to join with them in the form in which they can accept you. For once you are able to release the judgments about the differences in beliefs that you are holding on to, all that will remain is the love within your mind that you wish to share with them. You do not describe any external conflict with the others, but only an internal conflict, and there really is no need to make them aware of your differences in belief, unless you were to feel strongly guided to do so. For your goal is not to change them but simply to accept them as they are (T-9.III.6:4)."

    "text_input": "Q #155: I have been a student of A Course in Miracles for a little under a year. I would appreciate clarification on something that I just read in the text. Jesus speaks of the \"immediacy of salvation,\" and that the reason someone will not experience this immediacy is because there is still a small desire to be separate, and to hold onto guilt and unforgiveness. I have suffered with very disabling panic attacks for ten years, and I can completely accept and acknowledge that I have created this condition, and that my desire to be separate, guilty, and unforgiving are the erroneous thoughts that I have held onto. It is my deepest yearning to heal and release these misperceptions, because the pain of suffering this anxiety is completely unbearable and unacceptable to me. As great as my acknowledgment of my responsibility and my willingness to have my misperceptions corrected, I continue to suffer. Where is my error? Why has my deep acknowledgment and willingness not been enough to create the miracle, the immediacy of salvation promised by Jesus?",
    "output": "In the section you refer to, Jesus speaks of the space that we would maintain between ourselves and our brother as little, but because the space is small does not mean we should minimize the tremendous investment we have in keeping that distance intact. Our whole identification with this self we believe we are is maintained by keeping the thought of separation real in our mind, along with its projection into the external world as space between our body and our brother's. And so we have a tremendous fear of losing our self if we let go completely of all of our grievances and thoughts of attack now. Jesus comments on this fear: \"Salvation would wipe out the space you see between you still, and let you instantly become as one. And it is here you fear the loss would lie\" (T-26.VIII.3:4-5). So you want to learn to respect the depth of your fear, reflected in your panic attacks. The goal is to join with Jesus in looking at your fear, asking for his help in understanding its deeper source and purpose, buried in the part of the mind that wants to maintain its individual, separate existence. Patience with yourself, acknowledging that this is a process that will almost certainly take time, is also important. Resisting the feelings only pushes them down and maintains their intensity. Salvation is immediate in the sense that in any instant, if you are willing to let go of your investment in sin and guilt and fear, even temporarily, the peace that is ever-present in your mind can be your experience--until you make the choice for guilt again as a result of re-identifying with the ego and fear. With repeated practice, as you are ready and willing, you will come to realize that that is no sin, but only a mistaken choice that will become increasingly conscious in your mind. You do not say whether you have sought any kind of professional help for your panic attacks. Looking for outside agents (e.g., doctors, therapists, medication) to assist you in dealing with your symptoms can in fact be one expression of your willingness to no longer see yourself as separate and alone. It is only kind to be willing to open yourself to the help you need, in whatever form you are presently willing to accept (T-2.IV.4-5; M-5.II.2-3). For other questions that are relevant in various ways to the question your raise, you may wish to read Questions #128, #142 and #148."

    "text_input": "Q #156: I am very new to A Course in Miracles, and have read the introduction several times in hopes of having this question answered: Who is authoring the book? Is it the Voice, the Holy Spirit, Christ? Helen states that it is the \"Voice\" who dictates the text. How is the Voice different from God if it's God's Voice? I'm just having problems when the text switches to first person. Mentally, whom do I address? As I'm reading and feeling inspired, my comprehension or absorption of what is being read gets detoured by my mind asking, very loudly, \"Who is this?\"",
    "output": "Helen Schucman identified the \"voice\" she heard as that of Jesus. There was no doubt in her mind about this as she scribed the Course. (See #110) Therefore, the first person statements in the Course do refer to Jesus. The voice is not the voice of God, however. Neither does Jesus state that he is speaking for God. According to the Course, God does not speak words to us in the dream, nor does He \"hear our prayers.\" The \"voice\" is different from God because it is part of the dream. It is a reflection of truth, but it is not truth. As so clearly stated in the in the workbook \"God is\" (W-pI.169.5:4), and in His Being knows only our truth, which is that we are His one Son, who never left Heaven. The answer to your question lies in understanding the Course's use of symbols. These symbols include \"persons\" such as Jesus, the Holy Spirit, as well as images, words, and the Course itself. All are symbols for that part of the mind of the Sonship that remembers God. They reflect the truth of who we are, and in somewhat different ways, they are the reminders of our truth, and the guides who will help us return to God. Specifically, the Course refers to the Holy Spirit as the \"Voice for God,\" meaning--the Voice that speaks for God, and as \"God's Voice.\" Clearly this is a metaphor, since God does not have a voice and, as noted earlier, does not speak to us in the dream. When the Course invites us to \"ask\"--whether Jesus, the Holy Spirit, or God--it is actually inviting us to turn to our own right mind for guidance. It uses symbols and metaphors, because we are so out of touch with the fact that we have a mind. In its wisdom, the Course has used all its symbols carefully and purposefully. It meets us on our level, using dualistic language for a teaching that reflects nondualism. It seems to imply that God is a person Who hears our prayers, answers us, even \"weeps,\" yearning for our return. These are all metaphors used to help us understand that we are loved, not condemned for our seeming sin, as the ego would tell us. You may use whichever is most helpful for you. It is helpful for us to use these images and symbols until we learn that we do indeed have a right mind, and can access it directly. By then we probably will have no need for any symbol and no need to \"ask.\" We will have accepted the truth about ourselves as spirits, not bodies; innocent, not guilty. The right-minded loving response to any situation will flow through us. It is important, however, to be aware of any resistance, as apparently you have been in your study so far. Our goal in studying and practicing the Course is to learn that we do have a mind, that we do have a choice, that there is another way of looking at any situation in the dream, that our way is based on the belief that separation is real, and that the Holy Spirit and Jesus are here to teach us that there is no separation. Again, it does not matter to whom we address our asking, or what mental image we use. The important thing is that we ask, and not rely on our usual ego interpretation."

    "text_input": "Q #157: In his teaching, Ken Wapnick says that God doesn't even know that we exist; that we are here in the world. Where in A Course in Miracles does it say that, or what passage implies that? I don't have a problem with the statement, because I understand that in the Course \"existence\" refers to our belief in the ego, the belief that we are bodies, and \"being\" refers to our state of oneness in Heaven. So it would make sense that God does not \"know\" us in our ego state. But can you clarify where it comes from? Also, where in the Course does Jesus make reference to the \"decision maker\" that Ken refers to so often?",
    "output": "The statement that God does not even know that we exist, as you suggest, follows from an understanding of the Course's metaphysics. The self we believe we are, here in the world, is an illusory projection of an illusory thought in an illusory split mind. It has no reality. God, Who is total Oneness, can not know anything that is not a part of that total Oneness, and His knowing cannot involve a separate observer and an observed. If God knew of our existence in this world, the separation would be real. But the Course asserts over and over again that the separation never happened in reality--the principle of the Atonement (e.g., T-2.I.4:4; T-2.VII.6:7-9). Although the specific wording you ask about is never used in the Course, there are a number of passages that clearly imply that God does not know of our existence here. Among them are the following: \"God and His creations remain in surety, and therefore know that no miscreations exist\" (T-3.IV.7:1). \"God did create spirit in His Own Thought and of a quality like to His Own. There is nothing else\" (T-3.V.7:3-4). A little later, speaking of our self and God's Self, Jesus observes, \"They are fundamentally irreconcilable, because spirit cannot perceive and the ego cannot know. They are therefore not in communication and can never be in communication\" (T- 4.I.2:11-12). And in the next section: \"The ego's ceaseless attempts to gain the spirit's acknowledgment and thus establish its own existence are useless. Spirit in its knowledge is unaware of the ego. It does not attack it; it merely cannot conceive of it at all\" (T-4.II.8:5-7). The word decision maker as Ken has used it in his teaching is not found in the Course itself. The Course's one use of that phrase speaks of our resistance to recognizing the power of decision that resides in the mind, preferring instead to see \"the body... [as] the decision maker\" (M-5.II.1:7). Although that one instance is not describing the mind, the point being made is that the mind and not the body is the decision maker. The word decision maker thus is a convenient shorthand for referring to the part of the split mind that the Course is addressing throughout. It clearly can not be addressing the self that we believe we are, for the Course repeatedly reminds us that that self is not real and that the brain that we believe makes choices has no power at all. For example, in the workbook Jesus, with some amusement, observes, \"You also believe the body's brain can think. If you but understood the nature of thought, you could but laugh at this insane idea\" (W- pI.92.2:1-2). That the focus should be on the decision making power of our mind is most appropriate when we consider that Jesus emphasizes that \"the power of decision is your one remaining freedom as a prisoner of this world. You can decide to see it [the world] right\" (T-12.VII.9:1-2). And later, \"Each day, each hour and minute, even each second, you are deciding between the crucifixion and the resurrection; between the ego and the Holy Spirit. The ego is the choice for guilt; the Holy Spirit the choice for guiltlessness. The power of decision is all that is yours\" (T-14.III.4:1- 3; italics added). The centrality of the concept of choice or decision to Course teachings is evident when we consider that variations on the words choose and decide are used well over a thousand times across the three volumes of the Course. And the concluding section of the text, \"Choose Once Again\" (T-31.VIII), is a beautiful paean to choice."

    "text_input": "Q #158: I have difficulty understanding this section in the text of A Course in Miracles on attack: \"Attack could never promote attack unless you perceived it as a means of depriving you of something you want. Yet you cannot lose anything unless you do not value it, and therefore do not want it. This makes you feel deprived of it, and by projecting your own rejection you then believe that others are taking it from you\" (T-7.VII.8:1-3). Please can you help?",
    "output": "The fourth law of chaos says that \"you have what you have taken\" (T-23.II.9:3); and we know that projection is one of the ego's \"laws.\" Therefore, we are always suspicious of others, believing that they are plotting to take something from us. And ultimately what we believe they are out to steal from us is the peace of God. This, again, is a projection of the treachery of which we accuse ourselves. The point of the teaching is that the peace of God within us can never be taken from us unless we allow that to happen, which could be only because we do not really value it. And the reason we don't value it is that part of us knows that if we totally identify with it, our self as we know it would disappear and be replaced by our true Self which is beyond all individualized existence in this world. The defense against this is to blame others for depriving us of our inner peace, rather than take responsibility for throwing it away ourselves."

    "text_input": "Q #159: In my job my role is to be a helper, I notice that I reinforce my specialness by having a sense of importance and superiority toward those I help, while also hating them. I am also invested in having the things I do make things better. When there has been joining with another, I take credit for it. It seems that I am using all this to reinforce my individual identity in the world, and my guilt, so as not to move beyond specialness. Is it enough to be honest about my arrogance, trusting that Jesus can work with the honesty if I am willing?",
    "output": "Looking honestly at the specialness and hatred that we bring to all our relationships is certainly the first step in the forgiveness process. A Course in Miracles is asking us to do just that, so that we recognize the ego dynamics in operation. You also recognize the motives for the special love or special hate, which is very important. The same motive you mention is always in operation, keeping our specialness intact, so as to reinforce our belief in our separate identity, and in the world. The result, as you mention, is guilt, and that is our real attraction. As long as we feel guilty, we can keep the peace of God at a safe distance, stay in conflict, and keep our individuality. This is clearly the situation you describe. Looking at it honestly certainly moves you out of the denial that is so basic to the ego's sick scheme. Healing can begin when the sickness is recognized. The next step is to make the connection between this choice in the mind to reinforce specialness and thereby reinforce and cling to guilt, and all the pain experienced in the dream of separation. It is very important to make this cause and effect relationship. In it lies the key to undoing our belief in the ego thought system and its painful consequences. If the specialness and its ensuing guilt is a choice in the mind, this must mean that there is another choice that can be made, that will have a different result. Therein lies the logic of the thought system of the Holy Spirit as presented in the Course. Once this association is made, the next step is to ask Jesus for help in making another choice. Looking is not the end of our part in the healing relationship with Jesus. We must go a bit beyond that to asking for, and truly desiring, \"another way.\" This is not always as easy as it seems. We are often quite willing to let Jesus replace our pain with his peace, until we realize this means letting go of a lot more than we bargained for. It requires a willingness to let go of the investment in our specialness and the purpose it serves, which ultimately leads to the undoing of the entire thought system of the ego. Since the ego finds this threatening, it has an endless supply of inviting forms to keep us engaged. Our part is to remain vigilant for all its tricks and recognize them as all the same, so they can be brought to the Holy Spirit to be transformed. Remember, the Course does not ask that we be without our special relationships: \"I have said repeatedly that the Holy Spirit would not deprive you of your special relationships, but would transform them\" (T-17.IV.2:3). This is where the \"willingness\" you speak of comes in. It does not have to be perfect willingness; \"Your willingness need not be perfect, because His is. If you will merely offer Him a little place, He will lighten it so much that you will gladly let it be increased\" (T-11.II.6:6-7). The little willingness suffices, as long as we are not actively holding out by hiding our \"secret sins and hidden hates,\" denying them, justifying them, or calling them by other, less gruesome names. If you remain faithful to the process you have begun, you will surely find it will have significant results in your learning and healing."

    "text_input": "Q #160: Is there a difference between waking and sleeping dreams as an indication of which thought system and teacher you've really chosen, the ego or the Holy Spirit? During my waking dream, I study the principles of A Course in Miracles for hours each day, and try to be in my right mind, willing not to judge myself and others or judge that the world and the body still seem real to me. And so I very often find peace, or the willingness to find peace. But once I go into the sleeping dream, it seems like the ego's home turf. None of the mind training I've been studying and practicing shows up. The dreams are nonsensical, crazy, scary, and have no reflection of any holiness in them. So are my night time dreams really defining what beliefs are in my mind? Do these dreams negate and override my waking dreams? When my mind is healed will the content of both my day and night dreams be the same? Also, would listening to Course-related audio programs prior to falling asleep and while asleep allow ideas to penetrate into your mind more easily than while awake?",
    "output": "If you can remember that the ego's purpose is always to make differences seem real, you can begin to recognize that your question of differences between your waking and sleeping states is merely another arena in which the ego is attempting to confuse you so it can maintain a grip on your mind. And all the better if it can lead you to question the value and validity of what shifts you are already experiencing in some aspects of your life. It will be more helpful, rather than believing that there is a qualitative difference between waking and sleeping dreams, to recognize that in some circumstances you remember that you have a choice and in others you forget that you do. For some people, this may be reflected in differences in the intensity of their reactions and their willingness to forgive between their relationships at home and those at work. For others it may be differences in how strong their ego reaction is with one parent in comparison to the other. And in your case, it is a difference between remembering the Holy Spirit during your waking state and your sleeping state. Regardless of the specific circumstances in which the ego seems to have the upper hand, the solution will always be the same. As soon as you recognize that the ego has taken over and that you also have a choice of teachers--no matter whether it's in the middle of an ego reaction or sometime later--all you need do is ask for the help that the Holy Spirit offers. And so in your case, whether you remember while you are still asleep or only after you wake up does not matter. All you need to do is recognize that it's your ego and you can now make a different choice. Over time, we learn to generalize our lessons of forgiveness to more and more relationships and situations and states of mind. But we need not concern ourselves with why there are differences along the way. Our only concern is to recognize where we are still holding back and then, when we are ready and willing, apply the principles of forgiveness to those thoughts. Clearly, with your sleeping dreams, after you awaken, you know you are only talking about thoughts in your mind and not events that seem to have any reality and long term consequences. The fact that they can still seem to have power simply demonstrates the desire for the ego to be real. So generalizing after you are awake should become easier and easier, and in time you may find yourself beginning to remember the choice you have during your sleeping dreams as well. But whether you remember during the dream itself is not a critical concern, except in your ego's view. For further discussion of waking vs. sleeping dreams, you may wish to read #41. As to whether there is more of a willingness to learn Course principles when falling asleep or during sleep, there can be no definitive answer, individual differences being what they are. Some students in fact find listening to audios a great way to help themselves fall asleep!"

    "text_input": "Q #161: Why is the message of Jesus in A Course in Miracles so different than that of His mother the Virgin Mary in all her apparitions throughout the last century? In her message God is aware of what goes on in this world, and does punish the unfaithful.",
    "output": "The people who have experienced apparitions of Mary have heard a message that is compatible with their religious beliefs. In many cases, they are fervent believers with traditional theological views. The two points you mention, that God is aware of happenings in this world, and punishes the unfaithful, are beliefs held by many Christians. For believers, a religious experience such as an apparition by a spiritual being like Mary, deepens and validates their faith. Love would not challenge their belief system, by introducing unfamiliar concepts from a different path, such as A Course in Miracles. As you may know, the Course is a spiritual teaching that is not based on the Bible or traditional Christian or Catholic theology. Although it uses Christian terms, their meaning in the Course is different. However, both Mary's message, and the message of A Course in Miracles can be experienced as loving and helpful teachings for their respective followers. They may be similar in content though not at all similar in form. In form they are, as you say, very different. That is because they are two very different spiritual thought systems with different theological beliefs. It is important to remember that thoughts and beliefs are not truth; they are expressions or reflections of it. Jesus and Mary represent a truth that is beyond any of the forms that may give it expression. Truth uses different forms, at different times, for different people. This does not contradict the content of the message, the purpose of which is to lead us back to our home in God. As we are told in the Course: \"Helpers are given you in many forms, although upon the altar they are one. Beyond each one there is a Thought of God, and this will never change. But they have names which differ for a time, for time needs symbols, being itself unreal\" (C-5.1:3-5). Neither the theological views nor the specific beliefs is what is important. What matters is the love that is being expressed by a spiritual teacher, and the helpfulness of the teaching. If our concern is that God be sure to punish the unfaithful, we are missing the point ourselves. The important thing is that we be faithful to the beliefs taught by our spiritual path, with a fervent desire to return to God. If a person accepts the love that inspires their specific religious belief system and learns to truly live that love themselves, in the end it does not matter whether they began their journey out of fear of God's punishment, or because they were seeking God's peace. It is the experience that is important. The Course tells us: \"A universal theology is impossible, but a universal experience is not only possible but necessary\" (C-in.2:5). There are many paths, many faiths, many forms of expression, but one truth, one God."

    "output": "The meaning of this statement, in the context of the entire section, \"Beyond the Body,\" is that attack is possible only in fantasy or in a delusional state. God cannot be attacked in reality. The separation would have to be a fact in order for the mind to be able to attack. That is why there is so much emphasis in the Course on bringing the illusion to the truth, and bringing the darkness to the light.

Does this refer to the reader (me) and the Holy Spirit? And if so why would \"two\" not be capitalized if referring to the Holy Spirit? Could it also mean the \"two\" is reader (me) and the ego who thinks it's a happy day?",
    "output": "Earlier in this section Jesus speaks of the nature of the happiness--counterfeit or real--you experience as depending on \"the friend whose counsel you have sought\" (T-30.I.15:2)--the ego or the Holy Spirit. But here in the concluding paragraph, Jesus is referring to the real happiness that comes from our joining with a brother through Jesus or the Holy Spirit in the recognition that our interests are not separate but shared and that our minds are not split but joined. If this recognition is truly shared in our mind with any brother, it must then be extended to all the world, for it is all one. And this joining has nothing to do with bodies, neither mine (as the reader) nor my brother's. So my brother's body need not be present for this joining to be experienced and no words need to be exchanged. Jesus explains earlier in the text, \"Like you, your brother thinks he is a dream. Share not in his illusion of himself, for your Identity depends on his reality. Think, rather, of him as a mind in which illusions still persist, but as a mind which brother is to you. He is not brother made by what he dreams, nor is his body, 'hero' of the dream, your brother. It is his reality that is your brother, as is yours to him. Your mind and his are joined in brotherhood\" (T-28.IV.3:1-6)."

    "text_input": "Q #164: My view with A Course in Miracles has shifted considerably after listening to Ken's audio \"The Meaning of Judgment.\" The thrust of this audio is looking at your ego with no need to change it. In other words looking at our thoughts without judgment and realizing ultimately that what we believe has no effects on reality. Our powerful thoughts seem to be defused as we realize reality is not impressed nor shaken by them. However, Ken keeps reminding us not to judge someone else. It seems if that were the case then we would need a defense against those thoughts. For by saying we should not judge another have we not made judgment real? We are supposed to look at our egos without judgment. Wouldn't that include looking at our judgment of others without giving reality to it? Some of our judgments may be quite intense, but if we can look at these with the realization that nothing is happening, haven't we made progress?",
    "output": "You may have misunderstood. The audio program you refer to makes the point that the goal, contrary to what many students believe the Course to be saying, is not to stop making judgments of ourselves and others, but rather to learn not to judge ourselves for making those judgments. By resisting them and trying to change them, we are making them real in our mind, and that continues to give them and the ego power, as you observe. So the goal is to look upon our ego's judgments without taking them seriously, that is, without guilt, and without attempting to justify or rationalize them in any way. A very important part of the looking process is to recognize that our judgments have a cost to us. Judgment keeps the thought of separation real in our mind, banishing peace and inviting pain and guilt to remain. As we recognize the cost of our judgments over time, our motivation increases to join with Jesus or the Holy Spirit and release our investment in judging. So the point is not that we should not judge, but rather why would we want to if we really understood what accompanies it? By the way, reality is not simply unimpressed or unshaken by our judgments--it can not even see or recognize them! For our judgments have no reality. And so that is why, near the end of the Course, Jesus points out, \"It is necessary for the teacher of God to realize, not that he should not judge, but that he cannot. In giving up judgment, he is merely giving up what he did not have. He gives up an illusion; or better, he has an illusion of giving up. He has actually merely become more honest. Recognizing that judgment was always impossible for him, he no longer attempts it\" (M-10.2:1-5)."

    "text_input": "Q #165: I was sitting in my living room with my six-month-old son in my lap when a question occurred to me. I was thinking how the Holy Spirit does not even know about me or my son, but only loves the dreamer of the dream. My question is, is the dreamer the same for all seeming people in the universe? Is it one dreamer or billions of dreamers projecting their guilt onto the world? Do my son and I share the same wrong mind and right mind?",
    "output": "Whenever we speak of ideas predicated on a belief in separation and duality, regardless of whether we are speaking at the level of the split mind or the level of its projections into the world of form and bodies, we are speaking in terms of myths and illusions. So the dreamer of the dream and the Holy Spirit are ultimately no more real than the selves you think you and your son are. Any answer to your question therefore should not be considered a description of reality but ought to be evaluated only in terms of its usefulness in helping us in our practice of forgiveness--the only illusion that does not lead to further illusions (C-3.1:3-4). In A Course in Miracles' version of the myth of separation, everything began with the one mind of God's only Son seeming to fall asleep and dream a dream of separation. And that one mind was split into the wrong mind (the ego) and the right mind (the Holy Spirit), along with the part of the mind that had the power to choose between the two (the decision maker or the dreamer). In the dream, there is only that one split mind. But as part of the ego's defense against its own guilt and anxiety, to hide from God so that the life the Son stole from Him would not be seized back, the Son adopted the ego's strategy of further seeming separation into billions and billions of seemingly unique fragments that would be experienced as independent, individual minds. But each fragment, as a split off part of the one split mind of the Son, shared the same basic content: a wrong mind, a right mind and the power to choose between them. The phenomenon that has been called multiple personality disorder or dissociative identity disorder--dramatically illustrated in such films as \"The Three Faces of Eve\" and \"Sybil\"-- provides a useful model for thinking about this fragmenting process. Seemingly separate, independent personalities result from a splitting off of the one mind in order to protect itself from intense anxiety and guilt usually associated with a parental figure. While this illusory fragmenting was the ego's defensive strategy against God, it may also be used to serve the Holy Spirit's purpose of forgiveness. Since each seemingly separate mind has the same basic choice fully represented within itself, its choice for salvation through the practice of forgiveness is not affected by or dependent upon any other separate mind. In other words, each fragmentary mind cannot be victimized by any other mind--it is totally responsible for its experience. And by accepting responsibility for that experience and learning to recognize that it represents a choice, each fragment can learn over time to make the choice for the Holy Spirit rather than for the ego. When, in the end, the decision for the Holy Spirit is made once and for all, then the seeming fragment recognizes that there is no separation and that the mind is one, as it has been all along. The parallel with therapeutic interventions for individuals with multiple personalities is again illustrative. The goal is what is called integration: the various personalities are in time integrated as the barriers to awareness of the separate components are removed so that the mind recognizes its wholeness again. To answer your specific question then, there is only one mind dreaming the dream of separation and projecting its guilt upon a world it made for that purpose. But our experience while we believe that we are each a separate fragment is that my mind is independent of yours, that I am dreaming my own separate dream of separation, and that I can choose the ego or the Holy Spirit independent of what you may be choosing. And with that understanding, genuine forgiveness now becomes possible."

    "text_input": "Q #166: Lesson 39 of A Course in Miracles (\"My holiness is my salvation\") reads:  \"Specific situations, events or personalities you associate with unloving thoughts of any kind are suitable subjects for today's exercises. It is imperative for your salvation that you see them differently. And it is your blessing on them that will save you and give you vision\" (W-pI.39.7).  I'm not sure how the idea \"It is imperative for your salvation that you see them differently.\" reconciles with some of the major themes of the Course including the ideas that we let everything be the same and that there is no hierarchy in an illusion, not to mention that there is no order of difficulty in miracles. It seems to me it should say: It is imperative for your salvation that you not see them differently. What am I missing?",
    "output": "What you are missing is the use of the word \"differently.\" The idea is not to see the specific situations, events or personalities associated with unloving thoughts as separate or dissimilar within themselves, but rather to see the specific situations, events or personalities with loving thoughts (differently from how you have seen before). In the past, your sight (unloving thoughts) was through the eyes of the ego. Now you are encouraged to see through the eyes of the Holy Spirit (loving thoughts). Another way of putting it is that seeing through the eyes of the Holy Spirit is \"different\" from seeing through the eyes of the ego."

    "text_input": "Q #167: I've often had experiences of deja vu, that sense of having been there before, that have turned out to be genuinely significant. The circumstances in which the experience has occurred have varied from pleasant enough to downright unpleasant or stressful, but often have not seemed to have any obviously direct bearing on the experience. But in retrospect the outcome of  the situation has come to be something of a relief or possibly a blessing in disguise. I'm aware from my reading of A Course in Miracles and publications of Dr. Wapnick that, although time is an illusion and \"this world was over long ago,\" we experience and believe we still have choices to make, seemingly new. But we are really only \"reviewing mentally what has gone by.\"  My question is, how does the experience of deja vu relate to the choice for either the ego's program or timeline, or the Holy Spirit's for us? Is deja vu a reflection of the collective ego- mind? Or can it be a reflection of having made the correct choice through \"the decision-maker,\" outside of time and space and the ego's dualistic world of limitations, however unpleasant or pleasant the circumstances seem to be at the time? And could the sense of familiarity then be an echo of our \"distant\" or subconscious memory of God before the separation, when we were all one with him as Christ, as we still are in reality? And so could deja vu be a reminder or reflection in this world that we are on the \"right track\" or still in our right minds? Or am I just reading too much into these experiences? And related to this, what is the role of coincidence or synchronicity in the everyday, if still illusory, world?",
    "output": "Experiences of deja vu are neutral in themselves. Since, as you remark, we are only ever \"reviewing mentally what has gone by\" (W-pI.158.4:5), all of our experiences potentially could be viewed as familiar. These would include both the ego's scripts of specialness and the Holy Spirit's correction scripts. Now most of the time, it will be in the ego's best interest to keep that recognition from our awareness, for its defenses depend on a belief in linear time, flowing in only one direction, from past to future. Nevertheless, much as with psychic powers, reincarnation and past lives (M-24,25), it is the interpretation and purpose that we give to those experiences that determine whether they reinforce the ego's specialness or the Holy Spirit's forgiveness. If you have found that your experiences have ushered in opportunities for release of your judgments and guilt, then there has been a willingness on your part to allow them to serve that purpose. But they can just as easily be used to foster a preoccupation with the past, and specific and special relationships. With respect to coincidence or synchronicity, since only one mind has written all the scripts, everything is interrelated and connected. Only because of our continued investment in seeing separation and differences do we fail to recognize the common threads running through all of our experiences. When coincidences are recognized, they can be used for the purposes of either the ego or the Holy Spirit. The choice is always ours. When serving the Holy Spirit's, they are a reminder that decisions are being made at a level we are not usually conscious of and therefore they challenge the ego view that our reality is limited to this physical world. But a preoccupation with them can once again serve the ego's purpose of specialness. And so, whether we are dealing with deja vu, synchronicity, past lives or psychic powers, in every situation and circumstance, \"the first thing to consider, very simply, is 'What do I want to come of this? What is it for?'\" (T-17.VI.2:1-2). If our purpose is to see beyond the petty specialness and judgments of the world, the Help we need will lift us above the self-imposed limits of our ego to a place where we can recognize our shared purpose with every brother and experience the joy of our interconnectedness with the entire Sonship."

    "text_input": "Q #168: I have tremendous guilt over a relationship with a loved one who passed away recently. I feel I need his forgiveness. I know A Course in Miracles says that he has \"gone\" nowhere. But for all practical purposes, in this world that I perceive, I will never see him again. At times, the thought of this is unbearable. How do I deal with this? Also, his death brought up all kinds of guilt and self-hatred that doesn't even seem to be related to him. Why is this?",
    "output": "Our experience of the grieving process is indeed a complex one, whether or not one is a student of the Course--perhaps especially if one is a student of the Course. The process brings on the feelings you describe, and more, because death is one of the ego's most important defenses--if not the most important defense. It inevitably brings up feelings, all of which are related to what we have projected onto our loved ones. A deep sense of loss is normal and it is very important to be gentle with yourself in the process of dealing with your loss. Denying your feelings, or using the principles of the Course to invalidate them, will not help, and may hinder your progress in accepting the loss of your loved one. At the same time, much of what the Course teaches is applicable to the situation you describe and can be very helpful. Since you are in the midst of experiencing grief at this time it may be wise to review these considerations at a slow pace, coming to them when you feel you need to see beyond your sense of loss, setting them aside for the times when your normal feelings can rise. One of the most comforting aspects of the forgiveness that the Course teaches is that we never lose the opportunity to forgive. That is because what we perceive as an unforgiveness in a relationship is actually a projection of some form of unforgiveness of ourselves, since \"All attack is Self attack\" (T-10.II.5:1). Therefore, it is never too late for the forgiveness process, and it does not matter that the person we seem to need forgiveness from is no longer with us. Whatever the specific circumstances in the relationship may have been, it is the judgment that some \"sin\" was committed against the other that needs to be viewed differently. The Course tells us that through our special relationships we seek to assuage the guilt and self-hatred we feel for having separated from God. These relationships are based on the projection of this guilt and self-hatred, no matter how this is camouflaged. What seems to be vicious hatred perpetrated against another in some form of attack, is only a projected version of our own self-hatred. That is all it ever is. This self- hatred was underlying the interaction in the relationship in the first place. The attacks, seemingly directed outward toward others, are attacks on ourselves. This explains why you would experience the guilt and self-hatred directly, now that your loved one is no longer with you. For now they are being projected onto yourself. What the Course is teaches us is that an attack directed toward ourselves or toward another does not matter, since every part of the Sonship including ourselves remains inviolate regardless of our attacks. \"The betrayal of the Son of God lies only in illusions, and all his \"sins\" are but his own imagining. His reality is forever sinless. He need not be forgiven but awakened. In his dreams he has betrayed himself, his brothers and his God. Yet what is done in dreams has not been really done\" (T- 17.I.1:1-5). The only thing remaining is to forgive yourself for thinking that you could have truly hurt your loved one, or that your feelings of self-hatred in any way diminish the truth about yourself. They have no effect. The mistake is to believe the ego's interpretation--you have done something sinful that is deserving of punishment, you should feel guilty about it, and your self- hatred is justified because of it. When the Course tells us \"to forgive the Son of God for what he did not do\" (T-17.III.1:5), it refers to ourselves, as well as to our brothers. Again, it is very normal to miss the person you love, and the Course is very clear that we should not deny our feelings. Even after death, the Holy Spirit can transform a special relationship into a holy relationship. We need only be willing to recognize the unholy self interest we acted out in the relationship, forgive ourselves for it, and allow the Holy Spirit to reinterpret the relationship in our minds. The relationship can thus be healed. It is this healing that will alleviate the sense of loss and grief. This may be easier to practice than to try to convince yourself that death does not exist, when in fact you are feeling intense loss. It is the thought of separation that causes pain in our relationships, not the actual physical presence or absence of another person. Forgiveness of yourself for what you did not do to your brother, and acceptance of both his and your sinlessness, brings the peace that will replace your grief and loss."

    "text_input": "Q #169: In the past, I have had problems in gaining employment. I used to think life was too short to work, or money is not worth the time involved. I came to realize my excuses had to do with my inferiority complexes, shyness, inequality, etc., and I could not handle the expectations of an employer or social pressure within the workplace. Although I have made great advances with A Course in Miracles, and with forgiveness, I can't seem to distinguish between ego or Holy Spirit with regard to employment. It seems that there is no point in working, and I could devote my time to forgiveness. Or maybe by working I could learn my Biggest lesson in forgiveness. Which is ego? Which is Holy Spirit?",
    "output": "Discerning between the ego and the Holy Spirit can be a daunting task at times, and yet one of the most important, if not the most important, to master in your study of A Course in Miracles. Until such time comes as your certainty that all your thoughts and actions come from the Holy Spirit (the real world), the best one can do is do the best one can do, and then observe the \"fruits of one's labor,\" or as the Course would call it, \"The Test of Truth\": \"You have one test, as sure as God, by which to recognize if what you learned is true. If you are wholly free of fear of any kind, and if all those who meet or even think of you share in your perfect peace, then you can be sure that you have learned God's lesson, and not your own\" (T-14.XI.5:1-2). While you have experienced forgiveness in various areas of your life, it seems incomplete with regard to employment due in part to your seeming ambivalence toward it. Before you can become aware of what the Holy Spirit would have you do (or not do), you must be willing to hide nothing: \"You will not be able to accept perfect communication as long as you would hide it from yourself. For what you would hide is hidden from you. In your practice, then, try only to be vigilant against deception, and seek not to protect the thoughts you would keep to yourself. Let the Holy Spirit's purity shine them away, and bring all your awareness to the readiness for purity He offers you\" (T-15.IV.9:6-9). In other words, examine all of the thoughts you hold in your mind regarding employment. Make a list of \"good and bad,\" \"for and against\"--just let whatever is there come into your conscious awareness. Once all of the \"chatter\" about this topic has been voiced, then you are more able to hear the Voice which will guide you. You will find that your focus on the answer in form will recede as the content of being with or without guilt becomes more important. An exercise such as mentioned above will help you practice shifting your focus from the form to the content, from the effect to the cause. And remember too the important lesson Jesus teaches us about purpose: \"In any situation in which you are uncertain, the first thing to consider, very simply, is 'What do I want to come of this? What is it for?' The clarification of the goal belongs at the beginning, for it is this which will determine the outcome. In the ego's procedure this is reversed. The situation becomes the determiner of the outcome, which can be anything. The reason for this disorganized approach is evident. The ego does not know what it wants to come of the situation. It is aware of what it does not want, but only that. It has no positive goal at all\" (T-17.VI.2). But now you have a definite goal, and by making room within your mind to hear the gentle guidance of the Holy Spirit, you are ensured of reaching that goal."

    "text_input": "Q #170: It seems to me that there are cloaked allusions to the sexual drive as made by the ego in A Course in Miracles. I may be completely wrong but I don't know where to turn to find  validation for this idea, as well as many more questions I have about ego strategies and forms relating to Course material. Is it possible that the sex drive is an evolution of the desire to kill God and create the son of the ego? There is discussion in psychology circles about the inherent aggression in the act of sex, especially in rape and forms of physical abuse. Perhaps the most benign or \"loving\" act would be loving impregnation of a spouse in a holy relationship. Can you help me out with this?",
    "output": "Sex is just one of many manifestations in form of the ego's obsession with meeting its own needs, with little or no concern for anyone else. But in the hierarchy of illusions we believe in, it is one of the more potent, as well as guilt-inducing. Yes, it all began with God and our desire to seize the power to create life from Him, and to be the author of our own reality (T-3.VI.5:8; 8). That conflict is then projected out into a world of form, including sex with all its complicated interpersonal ramifications. And then, in an ambivalent contradiction that only the ego is capable of, we attribute the power to \"create new life\"--the so-called \"miracle of birth\"--both to God and to ourselves. Aggression is inherent in all acts inspired by the ego, more apparent in some expressions than in others, but always present in the underlying content. And it is not much of a stretch to see sexual connotations in some of the Course's more graphic descriptions of ego activity. The fourth law of chaos, for example, describes how we believe we must seize the \"priceless pearl\" that our brother has stolen from us and hidden in his body, tearing it from his body as we lay claim to what is rightfully ours (T-23.II.11-12). Melanie Klein, a student of Freud's, observed just such violent and destructive fantasies, with explicit sexual overtones, acted out in doll play by very young children in therapy with her. Although sex was made for ego purposes, like everything of the ego, it is possible to give it another, holy purpose. But this is not as simple as it may seem, because the world does not understand what love is, often confusing and equating sex with love. Early in the text, Jesus speaks of our confusion of physical impulses with miracle impulses (T-1.VII.1:2-3). In the original dictation, the reference was actually to sexual impulses (Absence from Felicity, p. 246), but the final edited text extended the context to all bodily impulses. It is not the form of the act nor the specific nature of the relationship itself that determines whether sex is loving, but the content or purpose held in your mind. If you experience guilt in any form, the ego has joined you and has assured that the focus is only on the body. But when you recognize shared rather than separate interests, and your goal is not simply your own physical satisfaction, you have invited the Holy Spirit to bless the union and have recognized that the real joining is between minds, not bodies. For a more extended discussion of issues related to sex from the Course's perspective, you may find the recent audio and video set, Form vs. Content: Sex and Money, helpful."

    "text_input": "Q #171: The more I seek to understand A Course in Miracles, some teachings become even more difficult. To wit, I thought I had at least come to terms with how the Son could have had a mad idea about resenting being a second-rate creator, God being THE Creator because the Son was an autonomous being created by God. But I now think that GOD IS, period. The Son was a Thought in the mind of God, an integral self-contained part of God. There was absolutely no distinction. So then the impossible could not have even been a tiny mad idea. Does this mean that there are two entities--one we call Real and the other unreal? The unreal is existing with the permissive Will of God, but outside of His positive Will? When the Course says God is not aware of the ego, is it speaking just as metaphorically as when it says God weeps for His Son? It  makes more sense to say GOD IS and stop musing because nothing could have happened. But something seemed to happen. What is this seem?",
    "output": "This is everyone's question, the most frequently asked question, in fact. And there is no intellectually satisfying answer to it. Let it suffice to have Jesus respond in his own words: \"It is reasonable to ask how the mind could ever have made the ego. In fact, it is the best question you could ask. There is, however, no point in giving an answer in terms of the past because the past does not matter, and history would not exist if the same errors were not being repeated in the present\" (T-4.II.1:1-3). \"The ego will demand many answers that this course does not give. It does not recognize as questions the mere form of a question to which an answer is impossible. The ego may ask, 'How did the impossible occur?', 'To what did the impossible happen?', and may ask this in many forms. Yet there is no answer; only an experience. Seek only this, and do not let theology delay you\" (C-in.4). \"Who asks you to define the ego and explain how it arose can be but he who thinks it real, and seeks by definition to ensure that its illusive nature is concealed behind the words that seem to make it so\" (C-2.2:5). In light of these passages, it can be concluded that the idea that God has both a permissive Will and a positive Will would not be consistent with the absolute non-dualism of the Course's metaphysics. Jesus is definitely speaking metaphorically when he says that God is not aware of the ego, as well as when he refers to the separation as a \"tiny, mad idea\"--and many, many other terms. Jesus does not refer to this as a divine mystery, or something like that, which we will understand one day. There just is no way that our understanding can achieve closure on this issue. We are left with the option of taking Jesus at his word, that an experience will come to end all doubting (W-pI.158.4:4), and that we will be better off than we are now if we apply the principles and exercises of his Course to our daily lives. If that does not turn out to be the case, there will always be another spiritual path that we can turn to that will bring us the peace of God."

    "text_input": "Q #172: What is the end result from studying A Course in Miracles? Should I be able to make life go in the direction I want it? T-21.II.2:3-5 states:  I am responsible for what I see. I choose the feelings I would experience, and I decide upon the goal I would achieve. And everything that seems to happen to me I ask for, and receive as I have asked.  This is obviously not a new idea and many people have heard it but few if any have been able to realize it or make it work in their lives. Is there something these people as well as myself have been doing wrong?",
    "output": "Peace--and the release from all guilt--is the end result of studying the Course and applying its principles (M-28.3:4-5). Although an initial reading of many of the passages of the Course, including the one you quote, would appear to suggest that the Course's purpose is to show us how to make our lives become what we want them to be, as you study the Course over time, it will become apparent that this is not its intention. In the above passage, the Course is speaking about the choice of feelings and experience only at the level of content, not form: will our experience be one of love or fear, peace or conflict, happiness or pain? There are many passages that make this clear. Among the early workbook lessons are two that admonish us: \"I do not perceive my own best interests\" (W-pI.24) and \"I do not know what anything is for\" (W-pI.25). The Course is asking us to acknowledge that we are not in a position to make decisions about what will bring us happiness or joy or peace. That is up to our Guide, the Holy Spirit. \"He does know all the facts; past, present and to come. He does know all the effects of His judgment on everyone and everything involved in any way\" (M-10.4:8-9). And so, \"Ask and He will answer. The responsibility is His, and He alone is fit to assume it. To do so is His function. To refer the questions to Him is yours. Would you want to be responsible for decisions about which you understand so little? Be glad you have a Teacher Who cannot make a mistake. His answers are always right. Would you say that of yours?\" (M-29.2:7-14). Even these line are open to misunderstanding and misinterpretation, for it is easy to conclude that they mean that the Holy Spirit will provide all that we need in our world to experience happiness here as we define it, which usually means having our needs met. But again, this is not the intent of the Course. Its focus is to bring about a change at the level of mind, so that we will become increasingly less affected by the things that happen or don't happen around us and to us. A sentence in the text makes this clear: \"Seek not to change the world, but choose to change your mind about the world\" (T-21.in.1:7). The kind of change that the Course is attempting to bring about within each of us is a shift from judgment to forgiveness. For, as the Course reminds us, \"those who have been forgiven have everything\" (T-3.V.6:3), not in a material sense, but in the sense that we remember that lack and loss of the love that is our natural inheritance is impossible. And we will look out on the world and see only peace, no matter what battles seem to be raging."

    "text_input": "Q #173: What is thought and what is thinking?",
    "output": "There is no definition of thought or thinking in A Course in Miracles. We get some idea of what these terms mean from the way they are used. But it is important to keep in mind that Jesus is using the language generated by the Son in his separated state, which is illusory. These terms and concepts, therefore, are inherently limited. Jesus is consistent in the meaning of what he is teaching us, but not in his use of terms and words; so sometimes it is difficult to pin down a precise meaning for a specific term. The Course is not meant to be, nor is it presented as, a philosophical or scholarly treatise, though there are profoundly rich and even provocative theoretical statements throughout. When capitalized, Thought always refers to the content in God's Mind; and when not capitalized, thought always refers to the content in the mind of the separated Son. Jesus sometimes uses the term idea to express the unlimited nature of our true reality: \"...you recognize, however dimly, that God is an idea, and so your faith in Him is strengthened by sharing. What you find difficult to accept is the fact that, like your Father, you are an idea. And like Him, you can give yourself completely, wholly without loss and only with gain\" (T-15.VI.4:4-6). In the last chapter of the text, conceptual thinking is singled out as the main problem, reflecting the earlier statement that \"consciousness, the level of perception, was the first split introduced into the mind after the separation, making the mind a perceiver rather than a creator. Consciousness is correctly identified as the domain of the ego\" (T-3.IV.2:1-2). In the last chapter, Jesus states that \"salvation can be seen as nothing more than the escape from concepts. It does not concern itself with content of the mind, but with the simple statement that it thinks\" (T-31.V.14.3-4). We hope this is helpful in some way. We were not entirely sure of the direction your question was taking, so we chose to answer it in this way. There is no \"text-book\" answer, unfortunately."

    "text_input": "Q #174: How does A Course in Miracles deal with severe woundedness? For many years, I have struggled with the inequality of parents and children, focused on abuse I received on all levels, resulting in impoverished development even though I am very bright. I have two questions:  The following answers are in response to different questions posed by the same person.  : How can I forgive evil? What happened to me is evil, sourced in escape of responsibility and outright violation--emotionally, spiritually, mentally, personally.  : What am I? What does it mean to be a spiritual creature (my body is light) while living in a world made of hate, conflict, and power?",
    "output": "The world is a desperate, cruel place, filled with the effects of evil thoughts. People can be unconscionably vicious and brutal to each other, abusing those over whom they have power, much as they have been abused by those who have had power over them. It is a vicious cycle from which no escape seems possible. Yet escape is possible, if we are willing to look beneath the surface of our ready judgments of good and evil and our facile distinctions between the guilty and the innocent. Now there may be a way of understanding what motivated your parents to treat you as they did, but that does not mean there is any justification for it. Yet you also are recognizing that holding on to the judgment and the pain only keeps you trapped in mental anguish that paralyzes you and prevents you from experiencing the joy and peace that we are assured is our God-given inheritance (W-pI.104). The Course recognizes that \"frightened people can be vicious\" (T-3.I.4:2). This awareness holds the key to releasing ourselves and everyone else from the grips of evil. It is fear that motivates all of us to act out our evil thoughts, and not inherent evil. No one in the world is immune from having thoughts of evil--that is the nature of the ego thought system that we all share. Some of us may have become better than others at curbing our overt behavior. But rage bordering on the murderous simmers within each of our minds until we learn how to uncover the guilt that fuels the rage and allow it to be healed in the light of the Holy Spirit's forgiveness. The ego is complete and total darkness--there is no light within its tightly sealed boundaries--and we all grope for our way, stumbling without hope while we remain identified with its evil purposes. We are all one in sharing the wrong-minded ego, although we may differ in how we give it expression in our lives. But until we acknowledge its presence within us, we will be caught in dysfunctional attempts to defend against the guilt and self-hatred that are the inevitable companions of our belief in the darkness within. We will seek to project that guilt outside ourselves and on to others. And so we will lash out, wanting to hold others responsible for the pain that comes from feeling separated from love. Some find socially appropriate but still ego- motivated ways to channel this overwhelming experience of pain and guilt. Others direct it out with little or no concern for its effects on others. And so these become the rapists, the murderers, the child abusers. And it becomes easy to see the sin and guilt within them, as a testament to our own \"innocence.\" Yet what drives them is no different from what drives all of us who have not uncovered these unconscious dynamics in order to begin to heal them. And so the first step in our own healing--after acknowledging our judgments against the murderer, the rapist, the abuser--is to recognize the common \"humanity\" that we all share--a desperate, pain-filled identity that places self-interest and self-preservation above everything else. We all do it, but our cover may just be better. If we can begin to get in touch with the fact that our own pain is the same as everyone else's pain, and it is only that pain which leads all of us to act in insane ways, we have opened the door to a more merciful and compassionate view of both ourselves and everyone else. For we will have begun to see that whatever cruelty any of us acts out is only a defense against the guilt and pain within--the same guilt and pain that we all experience. This is not to say that our own experiences of abuse should be denied. But there is a step beyond acknowledging the pain that we have felt at others' hands that we will take when we are ready to move beyond the pain. The problem in the present is not the events of the past themselves but the interpretation we are continuing to give them. And the Course provides us a different way of looking at those past events, helping us to understand what at a deeper level motivated the abusive actions, and how we share that same deeper motivation in our own life as we have been living it with the ego's guidance. Only then can we recognize the choice we have in the present to be released from the pain of our own self-judgments. We are all looking for a way out of our pain, but we blindly think and act in ways that continue to inflict pain upon ourselves--judgments and attacks against others that only reinforce the belief in separation that is the foundation of the ego thought system. When we begin to recognize the content of fear behind the ego's cruelty--either someone else's or our own--the judgments we have been holding onto can begin to dissolve. We will have begun to shift from the self-interest of the ego to the shared interest of the Holy Spirit, Who recognizes that we are all joined in the same need for release from the guilt and pain of the ego thought system. That recognition of shared interests is a reflection of the love that we all yearn for and the Oneness that we all share as the holy and innocent Son of God, an Identity that transcends the shared ego and its manifestations, from which the illusion of evil has arisen."

    "text_input": "Q #175: The following three questions all address the issue of death and so will be answered together:  : I would like to know more about \"death solves nothing.\"  : It is common for us to say when a person dies that he or she is finally \"at peace.\" Does death of the ego not release us from it's fear based thinking and grant us peace?  : Would you kindly explain what A Course in Miracles teaches regarding finding peace after death?",
    "output": "Since everyone in this world suffers the excruciating pain of believing they are separated from their true Home and their Creator, there are times throughout one's life that the thought of escape from this pain would seem to be a blessing. In this instance, death represents escape from our pain. And yet, A Course in Miracles teaches us that we are not our bodies: \"The body is the symbol of what you think you are. It is clearly a separation device, and therefore does not exist\" (T-6.V-A.2:2-3). Therefore we need not escape from our bodies, whether they be physical, psychological, emotional, astral, etc. What we do need to escape from, however, is the thought of separation, and this is accomplished through the process of forgiveness. If the mind has not been totally healed of the thought of separation once the body \"dies,\" the unforgiveness that it holds will be played out in other times and other forms until forgiveness is perfected. \"When your body and your ego and your dreams are gone, you will know that you will last forever. Perhaps you think this is accomplished through death, but nothing is accomplished through death, because death is nothing\" (T-6.V-A.1:1-2). At other times, we are may believe this world to be a spiritual testing ground, and death symbolizes an end to our testing, and our ticket back Home. Or we may believe that once we die, our egos are automatically transcended, and we will be at peace. Beliefs such as this tempt one to want death to come sooner rather than later. \"There is a risk of thinking death is peace, because the world equates the body with the Self which God created\" (T-27.VII.10:2). It is important to keep in mind that the \"death of the ego\" does not come from the body's death, but rather from the process of forgiveness, which only occurs within the mind. And, our bodies may die with or without completing this process. You can see in any of this instances how we are tempted to attribute pain to our body rather than to our mind. Once we have learned where the real problem lies, the Holy Spirit can begin to use our body to teach us our true identity as a mind: \"The Holy Spirit, as always, takes what you have made [the body] and translates it into a learning device ... He reinterprets what the ego uses as an argument for separation into a demonstration against it (T-6.V-A.2:4-5). So death (which is nothing) of the body (also nothing) solves nothing (the thought of separation, another nothing). Nothing plus nothing equals nothing!"

    "text_input": "Q #176: I am reviewing the workshop on \"Separation and Forgiveness\" from 1989. Could you please go over the second and third splits. It's almost like they overlap one another.",
    "output": "The second split represents the split mind dividing into the right and wrong minds, the thought systems respectively of the Holy Spirit and the ego. The third split occurs only within the wrong-minded ego, and expresses the ego's attempts to keep its separation intact by first splitting off from the right mind, and then splitting its sinful separated self (what we call self A) into two components: selves B and C. Self C is the projected repository of sin (formerly part of self A), which leaves the separated self B as sinless. In other words, the separated and sinful self A, minus sin (self C), leaves a separated and sinless self (self B): A - C = B. All this is explained in much greater detail (along with the first and fourth splits) in Kenneth's book, The Message of A Course in Miracles: All Are Called, Chapters 2 and 3. Keep in mind that this schema is merely a symbolic attempt to portray the dynamics of the ego thought system that A Course in Miracles sets forth. These dynamics focus on the ego's strategy of having us keep our separated self, but without the sin that would bring God's punishing wrath upon our heads. Now the sin rests in another (self C), who deserves the punishment we secretly believe we deserve."

    "text_input": "Q #177: Is it necessary to comprehend the mythology in order to begin study of A Course in Miracles, and to use the principles of the Course properly? I have great trouble with the metaphysics of the Course surrounding the origin of guilt yet the practical applications of the Course (i.e., choosing the ego or Jesus as your teacher) seem logical and helpful. Can I truly practice forgiveness as the Course defines it if I don't really accept the Course's mythology surrounding the origin of the world?",
    "output": "The benefit of practicing forgiveness is that we will feel better, because we will be letting go of the pain of self-deception involved in blaming others for our problems. It is practical in that sense. And it is very comforting to know that there is a loving, wise teacher within, of whom we can always ask help. We can go along nicely with that for quite some time, and even stay on that level indefinitely if we so choose. The Course can be used that way, and be of tremendous personal benefit and comfort. The metaphysical principles of the Course are not needed to experience the gentle guidance of Jesus, and to withdraw our projections of guilt onto others. If staying on that level brings one closer to God, what could be wrong with it? But since you specifically mentioned \"forgiveness as the Course defines it,\" it is necessary to go further. And so we will. The beginning and the end of the Introduction to the workbook shed some further light on this. Jesus begins by talking about the relationship between the text and the workbook: \"A theoretical foundation such as the text provides is necessary as a framework to make the exercises in the workbook meaningful. Yet it is doing the exercises that will make the goal of the course possible. An untrained mind can accomplish nothing. It is the purpose of the workbook to train your mind to think along the lines the text sets forth\" (W-in.1). At the end of the Introduction to the workbook (W-in.8-9), Jesus acknowledges the problems of credulity and resistance we probably will run into regarding the ideas and concepts presented in the lessons. And his advice to us is to concentrate only on using and applying the ideas exactly as he directs us to do, without judging them or evaluating them, because their meaning and their truth will be manifested to us through our using them. The implication would seem to be that somewhere along the line, the student is going to come face-to-face with the theoretical principles of the Course. For example, as it becomes clear that forgiveness means forgiving the other person for what he did not do--a truly startling, deeply challenging statement--we are led ultimately to question the reality of guilt itself. That would take us directly to the metaphysical dimension of the Course. Indeed, the Course's view of forgiveness cannot be fully appreciated without being aware of its metaphysical underpinnings. It would be too easy to slide into the traditional view of forgiving what truly happened if the illusory nature of sin and guilt were not an integral part of one's thinking and approach to grievances. The answer to your question, therefore, is both yes and no. One can benefit from practicing forgiveness and turning to Jesus for guidance; but the process of forgiveness as presented in the Course would be short-circuited and not fully appreciated if the Course's theory of the origin of guilt were ignored. If this theory were explicitly not accepted, it would make the practice of the Course's version of forgiveness impossible."

    "text_input": "Q #178: In A Course in Miracles, we are constantly reminded that to dispel the ego we must simply \"look\" at its machinations without judgment. In other words, with the Holy Spirit or Jesus. It is this process of looking that is a stumbling block for me. Does the Course provide a \"mental\" formula in the guise of a prayer, phrase or verse that I may employ when I recognize my ego is at work (which is, of course, all the time)?",
    "output": "Recognizing your ego is at work is a major component in its undoing, since the ego itself would never allow you to look at its shenanigans. The stumbling block arises because as quickly as you \"see\" your ego (the right-minded choice), you just as quickly become afraid, and then judge what you have \"seen\" (the wrong-minded choice). Your fear really then has come from your ability to look with the Holy Spirit's or Jesus' nonjudgmental gentleness and patience at your ego thought system, and that is why you run away. So you want to be gentle with yourself over your not being gentle with yourself. Since it has been determined that you have already become afraid, you certainly do not want to make yourself more fearful by punishing yourself for your lack of gentleness. At the end of Chapter 5 in the text is a lovely prayer you may employ whenever you experience this stumbling block: I must have decided wrongly, because I am not at peace. I made the decision myself, but I can also decide otherwise. I want to decide otherwise, because I want to be at peace. I do not feel guilty, because the Holy Spirit will undo all the consequences of my wrong decision if I will let Him. I choose to let Him, by allowing Him to decide for God for me (T-5.VII.6:7-11)."

    "text_input": "Q #179: I just recently began studying A Course in Miracles. I would like to incorporate the Course's teachings into my parenting. I primarily try to guide my children through the natural consequences of their choices, which seems to me the way God teaches us. However, sometimes it seems I must exert my will over theirs for their own best interest. For example: bedtime is bedtime on school nights; or if you have pneumonia and need a shot, there is no other option. In these situations, I am forcing my will on another, which kind of seems like an attack. Do you have any suggestion for parenting in alignment with the Course's teachings?",
    "output": "What will help is to focus always on the purpose of what you do, not so much the behavior: the content rather than form. Distinguishing between content and form is essential in applying the Course principles. Second, as students of a spiritual path, we should never lose sight of common sense. Thus parents are parents and children are children; they are not equals. And parents do know better than their children what is best for them. Exerting your will over your children's wills is an attack only if you mean it that way. If you are angry, punitive, tyrannical, demeaning, etc., then the content is attack. But if you are simply being firm with undisciplined children, then that is not an attack. It is not at all loving or helpful--as many studies have confirmed--to let children have their own way in everything. They would not grow up as healthy individuals, able to cope in the world, if they had no sense of limit, etc. It is entirely possible to set aside one's ego needs in order to discipline and train children. Parents' behavior might appear to be aggressive, behaviorally, when they are simply responding to the child's aggression in a way that is needed in those circumstances. Thus the behavior itself is not enough to determine what the content is. Obviously, though, if a parent is beating a child into a bloody heap, chances are pretty good that it is an attack. So the point is to practice discerning in yourself the distinction between form and content. Then bring the ego content to the love of Jesus in your mind and ask for help to shift to his content. When the content in your mind is loving, the message your children will be getting when you discipline them is that they are loved and cared for, and that they can trust you always to take care of them. We teach the principles of the Course to children by demonstrating them in our relationships."

    "text_input": "Q #180: I am in love with someone who is not in love with me. He cares for me only as a friend. I realize I have chosen this relationship as a form of an attack on myself in order to prove that I am unworthy of love. Would the most loving thing be to stay in this relationship and ask Jesus to heal my perceptions or leave the relationship entirely?",
    "output": "We choose all of our relationships to demonstrate that they will fail us, that they will not meet our needs, and that love simply can not be trusted, whatever form it seems to take. Special relationships which involve a romantic component only seem to be different because the intensity of emotions elicited seems so much stronger. But the content or the purpose is always the same. The belief that this self in the world that I think I am is unworthy of love is only a cover over the rage we all feel that we do not have the love that we feel we rightfully deserve. And that rage in turn is a defense against the self-accusation buried deep in our minds that we have rejected love by wanting something else. But the guilt and pain associated with that thought of betrayal are too great and so we project the responsibility for our lack of love outside of ourselves. If no one finds me lovable, it's not my fault. It's someone else's, starting with God, then my parents, and everyone else who has not given me the love that would prove to me I am worthy. The focus of A Course in Miracles is never on how to deal with the external relationship. So the Course would never counsel you on whether to stay in or leave a relationship. Rather it will help you to heal the buried guilt over attacking love that has been buried in your mind. The value of the relationship is that it has helped you get in touch with that hidden self-hatred. But if you do the inner work of healing the guilt in your own mind, the uncertainty you are experiencing over the form of the relationship will dissipate. The healing of your relationship with Jesus' help can proceed whether you remain in the relationship or not. For that has never really been the problem at all, but only a distraction from the real problem of the guilt buried in your own mind. For a related discussion, you may wish to review #20."

    "text_input": "Q #181: When I worked the lessons in Part II of the workbook of A Course in Miracles, my experience of God's Love was very profound. It felt very sensual. Even now, sometimes, during meditation, I experience the same warm, sensual feelings. I find myself feeling guilty. Is it wrong for God's Love to be experienced as sensual?",
    "output": "While it is true that any genuine experience of God's Love is beyond all feelings, sensations, thoughts and symbols, a couple of things are still true while we continue to see ourselves as existing apart from that Love: For one, our minds, still believing we are specific and concrete, will want to contain that limitless experience in a form or experience we can identify with, to avoid feeling overwhelmed by the immensity of it. So our minds may translate the experience into something familiar and comforting, even pleasurable, such as you describe. Early in the text, Jesus speaks of \"the confusion of miracle impulses with physical impulses\" and adds that \"all real pleasure comes from doing God's Will\" (T-1.VII.1:2,4). And another thing that is true is that our ego will seize upon whatever it can to sabotage the experience of love and peace to sow seeds of conflict. But that is only because it is threatened by the limitlessness of love in which it ceases to have any existence. So the wisest thing is simply not to judge what is happening, acknowledging that your ego may have its agenda with the experience, but its counsel need not be sought. Allow yourself the experiences you are having without judgment, without making them into a big deal in any way. And remember that the experience of God can and should be the most natural experience we could possibly have. And if we're not having it, it certainly is not because He is withholding anything!"

    "text_input": "Q #182: Chapter 2 in the text of A Course in Miracles, has a passage that says \"Illness is some form of external searching. Health is inner peace\" (T-2.I.5:10-11). Does this refer to physical illness and physical health? The first 100 pages or so in the text seem to associate physical health with a healed mind. If so, then it is directly relating the body--which doesn't exist--with the spiritual being we all are. Also would it follow then that someone who has cancer or some other form of physical sickness can still be totally at peace and have no guilt in their mind? Our discussion leader has said that having complete inner peace and cleansing the mind of guilt have no correlation to physical health, because God does not know the body or sickness. This seems to contradict much of what is written in the Course about only the mind creating, because if you are completely at peace and free of guilt in your mind, how can the body respond with some sort of suffering or illness? I am so confused on this question!",
    "output": "1) One thing that might be helpful is to keep in mind that one of Jesus' purposes in his Course is to correct our faulty thinking, insofar as we have identified with the ego thought system and therefore are always interpreting everything from that perspective. Following the ego's strategy, which has left us mindless, we normally associate sickness and healing with bodily conditions (physical and/or psychological): both the causes and remedies are found in the body and the world. This is the thinking that Jesus is helping us to correct, which is why he uses the terminology that the health of the body reflects the health of the mind. He is correcting the belief we all hold that the body's health is related to conditions and factors in the world. The more we think that way, the less likely we are of ever getting back in touch with the power of our minds. So he teaches us in a number of different ways that the body and its conditions are nothing but expressions of thoughts in the mind. This is all part of the plan of \"thought-reversal\" in the Course. We have reversed effect and cause, and he is teaching us how to get them back in their proper relationship. Taking us to the next step, he tells us later in the text: \"Thus is the body healed by miracles because they show the mind made sickness, and employed the body to be victim, or effect, of what it made. Yet half the lesson will not teach the whole. The miracle is useless if you learn but that the body can be healed, for this is not the lesson it was sent to teach. The lesson is the mind was sick that thought the body could be sick; projecting out its guilt caused nothing, and had no effects\" (T-28.II.11.4-7). We usually do not instantaneously accept and integrate these teachings into our lives. So our gradual shifting to Jesus' way of thinking would be reflected in our learning to break the connection between our internal state of peace and our bodily states. In other words, we learn that the internal experience of peace is not dependent on freedom from physical/psychological symptoms. This is one of the rungs of the ladder that helps us avoid denying what we are feeling. It is an interim stage, while we still go back and forth between the wrong and right mind. So we are not free of guilt entirely, but in instants of right-minded thinking we can experience peace while the body has symptoms of disease. That experience of peace is what attracts us more and more, and we gradually become less and less identified with bodily conditions; we become less and less identified with the body in general, and become re-acquainted with our minds. Now if the cause of the symptoms is guilt, then when the guilt is gone, the symptoms would disappear as well. BUT, symptoms can be present that do not originate with guilt. They might be chosen in the mind as a means of teaching others that the body is really nothing. There would be no internal suffering in these cases, because there is a clear awareness in that mind that it is not the body. Jesus, for example, did not suffer during the crucifixion because he knew he was not his body. The lesson in this is not to judge by form. In other words, just because there are physical symptoms, we cannot conclude that there is guilt. Now it is possible as well that a person (a mind outside time and space) has chosen to learn the lesson of the Atonement by means of what appears to everyone else to be a horrendous, tragic physical condition. We cannot see the full span of our own or another's Atonement path, so we need to be cautious in drawing conclusions about what our eyes see."

    "text_input": "Q #183: In A Course in Miracles we are asked to change our perceptions and see peace instead of chaos. But theoretically if I saw everything as loving then what is to stop me disregarding physical danger or emotional danger from others (because I am of spirit and nothing can harm me). How does one perceive correctly, taking into account our physical necessities while we are in the world.",
    "output": "I think you are confused about your responsibility, and that of the Holy Spirit's. \"Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all of the barriers within yourself that you have built against it. It is not necessary to seek for what is true, but it is necessary to seek for what is false\" (T-16.IV.6:1-2). At some point in time, we do realize that mouthing words of defenselessness while feeling completely vulnerable is not helpful. So we must begin to develop honest communication with ourselves. Focus your attention on all the ways you do not see things as loving, i.e., judgments of yourself and others, feelings of anger and hurt, disquiet of any kind. Once you are honest with yourself about what you're doing or how you are feeling, you can then bring this to Jesus or the Holy Spirit so they can fulfill their part: \"My control can take over everything that does not matter [your ego], while my guidance can direct everything that does, if you so choose\" (T- 2.VI.1:3). Bringing our ego to Jesus' truth allows him to guide us in ways that are most helpful. Needless to say, as long as we believe we are bodies, he would never guide us to do anything that is harmful or hurtful to ourselves, or others. And while the choice to bring your ego to Jesus or the Holy Spirit is an important one, an equally important choice occurs prior to this decision--that is the choice to look honestly at yourself. Because of your guilt and shame, you may think that you are keeping your \"secret sins and hidden hates\" (T-31.VIII.9:2) from Jesus, but you are really keeping them from yourself. This is why self honesty is such a crucial characteristic to develop. The simple act of acknowledging your fear, dread, hatred, etc. can work miracles."

    "text_input": "Q #184: I had a moment of clarity recently. I suddenly became aware that all my forms of specialness are based round the body and so they are all doomed to fail along with the body. Strangely this was not depressing--what I felt was mostly relief. The moment didn't last though, as peaceful as it was, and the fear returned. What I feel I want from you is reassurance that there is nothing to fear so that I can go back to the peace.  In the \"Rules for Decision\" section of A Course in Miracles, Jesus says that I can have the day I want. I consistently refuse to follow the steps he lays out though because I don't believe he will give me what I need. Can one take him at his word here? If the day I want contains my being happy and unafraid will he give me that? If the day I want contains being surrounded by people I love will he give me that? What if I feel I need other things, like food, sex, warmth and water? Will he give me them? I am frightened that Jesus, not being a body, will not because he doesn't think I need them. These are not things I think will make me happy, but they are things I do not think I could be happy without.  I understand from the story about Helen and her eyelash that it is not Jesus who gives parking spaces to me--it is my own mind. But may I still think of Jesus as giving these things to me, for a little while longer anyway? It is easier for me to accept when presented like that. Certainly I wouldn't want to have to provide my own happiness since it is so plain to me that I don't know how.",
    "output": "You certainly have put yourself in a bind! You know you don't know how to provide for your happiness but you don't trust Jesus to either. There is nothing wrong with continuing to want to see him as providing for your needs, but since you doubt that he is willing to, you really are setting up both yourself and him for failure. Because then when you feel deprived of anything, you can blame him. Jesus points out that \"only you can deprive yourself of anything\" (T-11.IV.4:1). It is we who believe we need to sacrifice and punish ourselves for the sin of separation and attack we accuse ourselves of. So long as this belief underlies our thinking, we will project evidence of scarcity and lack onto the various forms of our lives. But the goal of the Course is not to teach us how to provide for ourselves physically and emotionally, but rather how to uncover the love buried deep within our minds so that we know that real abundance--love--is ours. When Jesus tells us in \"Rules for Decision\" (T-30.I) how to have the kind of day we want, he is speaking only about content and not form. And so that is why he is encouraging us to make all of our decisions joined with him, or the Holy Spirit, rather than with the ego, which is the source of our belief in scarcity, lack and deprivation. For then our own judgments of what we need and what will make us happy will not get in the way. But while we still think we are a body, it will be difficult not to believe we know what at least some of our needs must be. Whenever you join with Jesus in your mind, even when it is in the form of asking him for help with specific needs, you have in the moment of joining set aside your belief in lack and limitation. Now Jesus in reality has nothing to do with form--it is always our minds that decide about that. Nevertheless, early in your experience with the Course, you may find that your mind translates that experience of his love into the forms of what you believe you need. And so you have the experience of Jesus helping you in the world. There is nothing wrong with that and it can be very helpful in allowing you to develop trust in him. But over time, you will begin to realize that your real need and desire is for peace, as you experienced with your insight about specialness. And so what is happening in the world of form and your body will become less of a concern and what is happening within your mind will increasingly become your focus. This certainly does not mean that your body's needs will no longer be met, for if you are releasing the need to punish yourself, your body will over time become simply a neutral instrument that functions without concern or fear on your part (W-pII.294.1). But if there are still lessons of forgiveness to be learned, your mind will continue to project the guilt out into the world as a physical problem or a bodily need. But you will now see the world, not as a prison in which you are deprived, but as a classroom in which you are being presented with opportunities to uncover the guilt buried in your mind that is being projected as scarcity and lack. And your goal will be to heal the guilt in your mind and not concern yourself with the form it takes in the world. And that is where Jesus can really be of help. For he knows that the guilt is not real and deprivation is impossible. And in that shared realization, peace is yours. For a related discussion, see #172."

    "text_input": "Q #185: If the world that I perceive is not real, does that not mean all who dwell within that world, including myself, are not real, and then would that not also mean that only God is real, and it is God who is having the dream?",
    "output": "The first three points of your sequence are correct; the world is not real, everyone in the world is not real, only God is real. What does not follow is that God is having the dream. God is not part of the dream precisely because He is real and a dream is an illusion. \"Real\" and \"illusion\" are mutually exclusive. The \"missing person\" in your equation is the mind of the separated Son who is the dreamer of the dream. This is the you the Course is addressing, and is teaching us to identify with. We have mistakenly identified with the \"figure in the dream\"--the you you think you are--the you that is not real. This has caused us much confusion. A Course in Miracles' explanation of how this has happened is that when the mind chooses to believe that separation from God is not only possible but real, it is as if the mind falls asleep and dreams a dream of separation. In this dream, the mind that is dreaming becomes identified with the figure in the dream. Everything is now turned upside down. The world becomes real to us. It is no longer perceived as the dream that it is, and we become lost in its illusions, totally unaware that we are dreaming. This is the power of denial in operation. What is denied is the choice in the mind to separate from God, and then dream this dream where God is absent and can enter not. The identity as dreamer of the dream is denied or forgotten, replaced by an identity as the figure in the dream. This identity crisis is the ego's goal. It keeps us free of responsibility for the original choice in the mind to separate, and the decision to deny the choice. The goal of the Course is to teach us that we are in fact the dreamer of the dream, whereby we have the ability to become a lucid dreamer, aware that we are dreaming, and that we also have the power to make another choice. If, as a lucid dreamer, we are aware we are dreaming a nightmare of separation that is the source of all our pain, we will eventually realize we can awaken from this dream. The Course tells us: \"You have chosen a sleep in which you have had bad dreams, but the sleep is not real and God calls you to awake. There will be nothing left of your dream when you hear Him, because you will awaken. Your dreams contain many of the ego's symbols and they have confused you. Yet that was only because you were asleep and did not know. When you wake you will see the truth around you and in you, and you will no longer believe in dreams because they will have no reality for you. Yet the Kingdom and all that you have created there will have great reality for you, because they are beautiful and true\" (T-6.IV.6:3-8). It may be helpful to relate this to the experience of a child having a dream. His parents are not in the dream, and are unaware that the child is having a nightmare. The nightmare seems real and frightening to the child while he sleeps. It is only when the child awakens that he realizes he was dreaming, and that he is safe in his bed with his parents there to comfort him, assuring him that the dream was not real."

    "output": "As earlier parts of this section make clear, each judgment we hold against another is really a deeply buried self-accusation. Perhaps most graphic is the following; \"No longer does it matter what he does, for your accusing finger points to him, unwavering and deadly in its aim. It points to you as well, but this is kept still deeper in the mists below the face of innocence\" (T-31.V.6:4- 5). The section then goes on (T-31.V.1516) to discuss how we will assume various concepts or roles for our self-identity over time (e.g., child, sibling, student, lover, spouse, parent, employee, boss)--all the while believing that we are a victim in these various relationships, treated unfairly by a world of evil that exists outside ourselves. But all the accusations we hold against others as we assume the various roles of our lives (i.e., \"the role of the accuser...in many places and in many forms\") really represent the hidden accusations of guilt and sin over the original separation thought and all its seeming ramifications that we hold against ourselves. And so as we accept and put into practice the Course's teaching on projection, it will now seem that the finger we have pointed at others is, in each case, now pointing at ourselves. But the reality of our true Self is beyond all these roles and concepts. And so Jesus reassures us, \"Yet have no fear it [each role] will not be undone\" (T-31.V.16:7). For none of the images of good or evil that we have made of both our brother and ourselves is real. And when we no longer want any of them, we will know Who we truly are (T-31.V.17)."

    "text_input": "Q #187: So what happens when one is finally able to let go of one's ego? Does one, as an individual, cease to exist? I know I am attached to my individuality. I like my life, basically. I don't want to disappear into....what? I like the world and think it is beautiful. I don't want the world to disappear. What happens when our bodies die? What happens when we awake from the dream? Do we awake from the dream when our bodies die?",
    "output": "You can rest assured that so long as you want an individual self and the world to be your reality, they will be. Jesus makes this clear in a number of passages. Speaking of the world we see, he says, \"...you invented it. You can give it up as easily as you made it up. You will see it or not see it, as you wish. While you want it you will see it; when you no longer want it, it will not be there for you to see\" (W-pI.32.1:2-5). And later in the workbook, \"There is no world apart from what you wish, and herein lies your ultimate release.... It is not pride which tells you that you made the world you see, and that it changes as you change your mind\" (W-pI.132.5:1,5). And earlier in the text, he assures us, \"Fear not that you will be abruptly lifted up and hurled into reality\" (T-16.VI.8:1). So you are not at this point looking for release--that is fine. Jesus has no judgment about that. He may question your sanity (T-23.II.13:4-13). But he does not judge you for preferring the world to his love. Most of us do not recognize or believe that this is the choice we are making. And so one of the purposes of A Course in Miracles is to help us see that we are choosing the world and our individual self, and that choice represents a choice against love and peace. Genuine love and peace can only be found in unity, not in separation and differences. If the world still holds great appeal for you, the Course will be less desirable as a spiritual path. It will teach you the value of letting go of your judgments and, as a result, of having less pain, guilt and anxiety in your relationships. But the metaphysics that is the Course's foundation for forgiveness asserts the unreality of the separation, the individual self, and the world. Such a teaching runs counter to your expressed preference for the world and at some point you may experience conflict. But the truth is, none of us would find ourselves here in the world if it were not our preference and our choice, as the passages cited above make clear. So what is most important is that you are honest with yourself and Jesus about what you want right now and how you feel. If, over time, you come to accept that the choice you are making has a cost to you, you can reconsider your decision at that point. When you are ready to release completely your identification with the ego self and the world, which is its defense, nothing really will happen. You will simply experience a profound shift in perception. Death has nothing to do with this shift anymore than birth has. The death of the body does not change the decision being made in the mind to be separate--it may in fact reinforce that choice, if the death in any way feels like a punishment or a deprivation or an escape. And then we will simply choose another lifetime to continue our experience of individuality and specialness. Everything is happening in the mind and when your mind lets go of the ego, you will simply awaken to the fact that you have only been dreaming a dream of separation. And so there is no separation, no separate self and no external world. The dream may appear to continue, but you will not take it seriously, knowing it is simply a fantasy or illusion that has no real meaning or effects. You will know you are limitless mind and not a limited bodily self. And the joy that comes from the realization that the mind is truly one will make whatever joy and beauty the world seemed to offer you before seem like a pale, lifeless shadow in comparison. See also #68 for a discussion of the relationship between the mind and death of the body."

    "text_input": "Q #188: After studying A Course in Miracles for 11 years, I'm only now beginning to understand how much I don't want to learn it. I know this really means how much I fear it, and that I might need to be more \"gentle\" with myself. But trying to take things less seriously would seem to undermine the Course's attempt to show us just how deeply we are committed to the ego thought system. Thank you for any suggestions on this, from a student who still loves being the dream figure amid glimpses that he is not.",
    "output": "Apparently, trying to take things less seriously has in fact shown you \"just how deeply we are committed to the ego thought system.\" Taking things less seriously is not as easy as it may sound. Any attempt to do so leads us to realize that we do take things very seriously. In studying the Course, we soon become aware that if we begin to take some aspects of the ego thought system less seriously we will end up taking the whole thing less seriously. In the end, rather than undermining the Course's teaching, this will actually undermine the ego's thought system. This is why we don't do it. And this is why we don't want to learn what the Course teaches. This in itself is an important and helpful realization. It means that you have some understanding of what the Course is saying about who we are (the dreamer of the dream), and more importantly, who we are not (a figure in the dream). A clear recognition of our resistance to learning this gives us an appreciation for the process and, as you say, the need for gentleness in applying the teachings of the Course. It is not surprising that it is difficult to take things less seriously. The Course does not discount how seriously we have taken our mistaken beliefs about ourselves and our world. \"No one believes there really was a time when he knew nothing of a body, and could never have conceived this world as real. He would have seen at once that these ideas are one illusion, too ridiculous for anything but to be laughed away. How serious they now appear to be! And no one can remember when they would have met with laughter and with disbelief. We can remember this, if we but look directly at their cause. And we will see the grounds for laughter, not a cause for fear\" (T-27.VIII.5:5-10). Our learning process requires that first we recognize just how seriously we take ourselves. Trying to force ourselves not to take things seriously probably won't work. The only way we can learn to do this is mentioned in the quote above. We need to learn to look at the cause of our beliefs. The cause is the decision in the mind to separate from God, and then believe it is an accomplished fact. The Course is telling us this is ridiculous, and eventually we will laugh at it. This will happen when we have let go of our guilt over having taken it seriously in the first place. Obviously we are not laughing yet. You may find it helpful to practice not taking your resistance too seriously, and not judging yourself for your love of being a figure in the dream. Our resistance and unwillingness do not change truth, or justify our fear, and we are not banished from Heaven because of them. Furthermore, full acceptance is not required for us to practice what the Course teaches. As the Introduction to the workbook tells us: \"Remember only this; you need not believe the ideas, you need not accept them, and you need not even welcome them. Some of them you may actively resist. None of this will matter, or decrease their efficacy\" (W- in.9:1-3). If you continue to remind yourself that what you see and experience in the dream is not real and has no effect on the real you, it will become increasingly easier to take things less seriously. Each remembrance strengthens belief in the Holy Spirit's thought system and diminishes our \"seriousness.\" As with God, the laughter is inevitable."

    "text_input": "Q #189: What does A Course in Miracles refer to as \"all\" in the sentence \"To have, give all to all.\" (T-6.V-A5:13)? I have heard Ken say that it doesn't mean to give everything away in this world and go live on a mountain top. What does it mean?",
    "output": "First, Jesus is correcting the ego's version, which is \"to have, take all from all.\" To the ego, the only way of having something is to get it from somewhere or someone. Therefore, Jesus tells us, \"the first step in the reversal or undoing process is the undoing of the getting concept\" (T- 6.V-B.3:1). This is directly related to our learning to prefer shared interests instead of separate, competing interests; and that by seeking to take something from someone, we will wind up as the loser, because we will have once again denied that God's Son is one and that as His creation we already have everything (W-pI.133.7). So this has nothing to do with form or with behavior; it has to do with our attitude or inner orientation: the content, not the form. It has to do with undoing our inclination to exclude others and to acquire what we want at another's expense. It has to do with looking at how we value uniqueness and specialness, and how that leads to more conflict instead of peace. We would begin to question the value of something that cannot be shared with everyone--why we would want something that cannot be shared with everyone. Again, this has to do with our attitude. Obviously, as you said, we are not being asked to buy enough for everyone in the world whenever we go shopping. Jesus is working with the premises that govern our thinking. This first lesson of the Holy Spirit, then, is essentially about undoing our concept of getting as the means of having: \"You learn first that having rests on giving, and not on getting\" (T-6.V- C.6:1)."

    "text_input": "Q #190: A two-part question regarding the 'script' of our lives:  : If I choose my parents, nationality, sex, time I live in before I'm born, what contingencies are there in my life? Many or none? Is it all spelled out beforehand so all I'm choosing at each moment is crucifixion or resurrection? What, in other words, is not written beforehand?  : What role does the right mind have in choosing all of the above beforehand?",
    "output": "We set certain seemingly unchangeable parameters for each lifetime, including those you list above. But even some of these can shift as the mind chooses: one learns as an adult that he or she was adopted; someone opts for a sex change operation, etc. Part of the ego's seductive allurement is that we do have choice at the level of form and this is the great distraction. For we believe the problem of our guilt over separation, which remains buried in our mind, can be resolved \"by making some sort of insane 'arrangement' with the world\" (T-12.III.6:5)--what A Course in Miracles calls magic (M-16.8-11). So the ego maintains the illusion of choice at the level of form, keeping hidden from us the fact that we are always choosing the same content: separation and guilt. And we never address the real underlying problem of the guilt in our mind. Now it is true that the Course teaches that everything has already happened and that linear time is not real--everything is already written beforehand (W-pI.158.3-4). But that does not mean that everything in an individual lifetime is predetermined. The pool of possible events is predetermined, but we have a moment-by-moment choice about which relationships and events we will access and review (for a more extended discussion of this, see #37). Despite all these options, the most helpful frame of reference we can adopt is to remember that, regardless of the possibilities on the level of form, the only real choice we are confronted with in each moment is the one between crucifixion and resurrection. Since we always have a right mind while we still believe in the reality of separation, we have the option of turning to our right mind about any decision we are making, including how to approach a new relationship, a new career, or a new lifetime. The distinction between before and during a lifetime is really an arbitrary one that our ego mind wishes to reinforce, making the state of our mind seem somehow qualitatively different during this lifetime from the state of the mind when this lifetime is still only an option being considered. And so, as with every choice, we can make it with either the ego or the Holy Spirit as our teacher. And as most of us do, we may vacillate between the wrong mind and the right mind, sometimes making choices based on our desire for specialness and sometimes choosing in order to learn our lessons of forgiveness. This is true, from the perspective of illusory linear time, both before and during each lifetime Again, whether we are choosing the parameters for an upcoming lifetime or the parameters within a current lifetime, the options and the process in the mind remain the same."

    "text_input": "Q #191: I would like to know your opinion on \"special relationships.\" Is every relationship in which there is love a special one? The relationship with your children for instance? Is it enough that only one in the relationship have knowledge about A Course in Miracles?",
    "output": "The Course tells us that every relationship, whether we define it as a love or hate relationship, is special. The ego uses every relationship to project guilt onto another for our decision to separate from God. Using the relationship for purposes of projection is an attack, which the Course calls hate. Every special relationship is therefore actually a hate relationship, camouflaged in some cases as \"love.\" The ego identifies every person as a body, and relates to each one as a body, which according to the Course is another form of attack on the Son of God, who is not a body. The projection of guilt and perception of body identity are fundamental characteristics of the special relationship. Although we may be unaware of them, these are the dynamics at work in every relationship. It is difficult to apply this concept to our relationships with our children because the world has glorified parenthood, and we use children and family relationships to express \"love\" as defined by the ego. The care, concern, and attention that is given to children is not love as the Course defines it; they are part of the dynamic the ego has set up as \"pseudo love,\" which is actually a substitute for God's love. This substitution is another important characteristic of the special relationship. Anyone or anything that is used in an attempt to fill the void left by our seeming separation from God is what the Course calls special. Children fit the ego's plan perfectly because they come into the world totally dependent on the care of others, having been given \"life\" by parents who will hopefully meet all their needs for growth and sustenance. Part of the parenthood dysfunction is the belief, on the part of parents, that children will meet their needs as well. This mutual dependency, in which each agrees to sacrifice in order to have their own needs met, is the \"bargain\" that the ego claims will keep everyone safe and \"happy.\" It sometimes seems to work; frequently it is beset with great pain and conflict, driven by intense feelings of guilt. The Course gives us a vivid description: \"All special relationships have sin as their goal. For they are bargains with reality, toward which the seeming union is adjusted. Forget not this; to bargain is to set a limit, and any brother with whom you have a limited relationship, you hate. You may attempt to keep the bargain in the name of \"fairness,\" sometimes demanding payment of yourself, perhaps more often of the other. Thus in the 'fairness' you attempt to ease the guilt that comes from the accepted purpose of the relationship. And that is why the Holy Spirit must change its purpose to make it useful to Him and harmless to you\" (T-21.III.1). In this, as with everything the Course teaches, it is enough that only one person in the relationship be a student of the Course. The practice of the Course's teaching requires only that the individual look carefully at all the thoughts of judgment in any relationship, and recognize the ego's purpose at work in all of them. The purpose is always to make the separation real, and strengthen our belief that we can make a world of our own that will meet our needs better than God ever could. We do not do this for anyone but ourselves. When we recognize the ego's ploys, and begin to realize that our pain is actually coming from our alliance with the ego's thought system of separation, guilt, and attack, we have the opportunity to turn to the Holy Spirit, whose thought system reinterprets everything the ego has made, and ask for help. The help is not to change anyone else in the dream, but for ourselves to accept His purpose. Although this may not bring about any change in form in our relationships, the purpose will be transformed: \"...the Holy Spirit would not deprive you of your special relationships, but would transform them. And all that is meant by that is that He will restore to them the function given them by God. The function you have given them is clearly not to make happy. But the holy relationship shares God's purpose, rather than aiming to make a substitute for it. Every special relationship you have made is a substitute for God's Will, and glorifies yours instead of His because of the illusion that they are different\" (T-17.IV.2:3-7). Eventually, as this is practiced more and more the pain of special relationships will be replaced by the peace of the holy relationship."

    "text_input": "Q #192: \"I do not choose God's channels wrongly\" (T-4.VI.6:3). This line has always had a strong emotional impact on me (it made me cry, boosted my confidence, etc.), but sometimes I think this line perhaps was meant only personally for Helen?",
    "output": "It must always be remembered that A Course in Miracles came for Helen and Bill in response to their joining together to find a better way of relating. Therefore, many of the comments-- especially in the early chapters--were meant for them; but clearly they can be seen as applying to all of us who struggle with the same issues with which they struggled. The statement you refer to, therefore, in no way implies that they were special, a meaning our egos would immediately see in it, as the ego knows only of separation. Helen did not see herself as specially blessed in any way, and very quickly corrected anyone who regarded her as special. Connecting this statement with two other key statements further clarifies the meaning: \"All my brothers are special\" and \"All are called\" (T-1.V.3:6; T-3.IV.7:12). While using the language of the Bible, Jesus clearly corrects the traditional view that singles out certain special people: \"many are called, but few are chosen,\" or groups of people: \"the chosen people.\" He is basically telling us that we are not mistaken in thinking that we are dear to him. At the beginning of Lesson 93, he describes the horribly negative self-concept we harbor deep within our minds--sometimes not very far beneath the surface. And then he tells us that we are so convinced that this is the truth about us that it is difficult for him to help us see that it is all based on nothing (W-pI.93.1-2). That explains why we would tend to think that Jesus was referring only to Helen and Bill, not us, a trend of thought he later calls arrogant. When we think that way, we ought to stop and reflect on where those thoughts are coming from, and how in feeling unworthy we are really telling Jesus he is wrong about us. Then, too, we must remember that although our experience at first may be that of being chosen, that is not the reality. As we get further up the ladder, our experience will be that we are really allowing ourselves to experience love more and more, and resisting it less and less."

    "text_input": "Q #193: The Lord's Prayer, supposedly given directly from Jesus, seems to make the world and sin real and request God's involvement in our life. From the Course's perspective, how would we explain this and what would be an example of valid prayer in the \"dream\"?",
    "output": "Since the gospels were written down approximately 50 years after the historical Jesus' death, there is no certainty that any of the accounts accurately report what the he actually said. In fact, Scripture scholars have established that Jesus probably did not say most of the things that are recorded in the Gospels. The Lord's Prayer, therefore, would not necessarily have come directly from Jesus. It is compatible with the entire teaching of the Bible, both Old and New Testaments, which, as you say, make sin and the world very real. From the perspective of A Course in Miracles, the only explanation for this is that the teaching of the Bible is not the teaching of the Course. They are not similar and can be compared only in contrast, since the Course uses terms found in the Bible but with a different interpretation. Prayer in the dream is ultimately a reminder to ourselves that we have a mind with the power to choose. In the face of any conflict or distressing situation, our prayer can be simply stated: \"brother, choose again\" (T-31.VIII.3:2). Implicit in this prayer is the recognition that we have already made a choice. It is this choice, not the situation, that is the real cause of our distress, and we can \"choose again.\" This is a very simple prayer, but to say it sincerely, with acceptance of the implications noted above, can meet with strong resistance. It requires taking full responsibility for our choices, as well as the predicaments we find ourselves in. Although this is the process involved in prayer as the Course teaches, the Course meets us on the many different levels of our learning. Because we have a need to experience the power of our own minds in symbolic form, we find prayers addressed to God our Father, or the Holy Spirit. Many of these are very beautiful \"prayers\" which actually speak to our hearts rather than to God, who does not hear prayers (T-16.VII.12). They are given to us to help us get in touch with the true desire of our hearts, and to encourage us to make another choice. This is the prayer of the heart that the Manual refers to, in contrast to the \"prayer for specifics\" (M-21.2:3). This prayer of the heart refers to what we truly desire. The Course also tells us our prayer is heard, and we that we do receive what we ask for. Our \"prayer\" is always for only one of two things--the ego's interpretation, or the Holy Spirit's. We will receive the one we truly desire. This obviously occurs on the level of the mind where the choice is made. The effect of our prayer will be experienced in the dream in the form of peace (reflecting our choice for the Holy Spirit) or in some form of conflict (reflecting our choice for the ego). The specifics do not matter. It is always the disposition of our hearts, our willingness, that is most important. We \"pray\" when we look within with willingness to recognize whose voice we have chosen to listen to. Engaging in this process indicates that we have already chosen to listen to the ego. We then have the opportunity to ask ourselves if this is truly what we want to hear, and, as stated in the beginning, we can now choose again. We will know if we are in fact listening to the Holy Spirit by the peace we will eventually experience: \"The part [of your mind] that is listening to the Voice for God is calm, always at rest and wholly certain. It is really the only part there is. The other part is a wild illusion, frantic and distraught, but without reality of any kind. Try today not to listen to it. Try to identify with the part of your mind where stillness and peace reign forever. Try to hear God's Voice call to you lovingly, reminding you that your Creator has not forgotten His Son\" (W-pI.49.2). Our \"prayer\" is this listening."

    "text_input": "Q #194: You explain in many places that A Course in Miracles is uncompromising about the fact that this world does not exist. Could you list the passages from the text and/or the workbook that explain that this is so?",
    "output": "We are listing a number of references here, and we also refer you to #111. This is an important issue, which actually is the foundation of the whole thought system of A Course in Miracles. You might also find our Glossary-Index for A Course in Miracles helpful--under \"world.\" When the main principles are identified, then you can see how they are expressed in many different ways. For example, if only what God creates exists, and God creates only what is eternal and infinite, then anything not of God does not and could not exist, i.e., the changing, limited cosmos. A sampling of statements: \"Perception is not an attribute of God. His is the realm of knowledge ... In God you cannot see. Perception has no function in God, and does not exist\" (W-pI.43.1:1-2; 2:1-2). \"There is no world! This is the central concept the course attempts to teach\" (W-pI.132.6:2-3). There are other statements within this lesson that state the unreality of the world; e.g., \"How can a world of time and place exist, if you remain as God created you?\" (9:4); \"There is no world because it is a thought apart from God, and made to separate the Father and the Son, and break away a part of God Himself and thus destroy His Wholeness. Can a world which comes from this idea be real? Can it be anywhere?\" (13:1-3). \"I am as God created me\"; \"What has been given you? The knowledge that you are a mind, in Mind and purely mind, sinless forever, wholly unafraid, because you were created out of love. Nor have you left your Source, remaining as you were created\" (W-pI.158.1:1-3). \"Sin is the home of all illusions, which but stand for things imagined, issuing from thoughts that are untrue. They are the 'proof' that what has no reality is real. Sin 'proves' God's Son is evil; timelessness must have an end; eternal life must die. And God Himself has lost the Son He loves, with but corruption to complete Himself, His Will forever overcome by death, love slain by hate, and peace to be no more\" (W-pII.4.3). \"What if you recognized this world is an hallucination? What if you really understood you made it up? What if you realized that those who seem to walk about in it, to sin and die, attack and murder and destroy themselves, are wholly unreal?\" (T-20.VIII.7:3-5.) \"There is no life outside of Heaven. Where God created life, there life must be. In any state apart from Heaven life is illusion ... Life not in Heaven is impossible, and what is not in Heaven is not anywhere\" (T-23.II.19.1-2,6). \"God's laws do not obtain directly to a world perception rules, for such a world could not have been created by the Mind to which perception has no meaning. Yet are His laws reflected everywhere [through the Holy Spirit]. Not that the world where this reflection is, is real at all. Only because His Son believes it is, and from His Son's belief He could not let Himself be separate entirely. He could not enter His Son's insanity with him...\" (T-25.III.2:1-4). \"This world is causeless...\" (T-28.II.6:1). \"They [your eyes and ears] were made to look upon a world that is not there; to hear the voices that can make no sound\" (T-28.V.5:4). \"What seems eternal all will have an end. The stars will disappear, and night and day will be no more. All things that come and go, the tides, the seasons and the lives of men; all things that change with time and bloom and fade will not return. Where time has set an end is not where the eternal is\" (T-29.VI.2:7-10). \"Can what has no beginning really end? The world will end in an illusion, as it began\" (M- 14.1:1-2). \"The world you see is an illusion of a world. God did not create it, for what He creates must be eternal as Himself. Yet there is nothing in the world you see that will endure forever. Some things will last in time a little while longer than others. But the time will come when all things visible will have an end\" (C-4.1). \"What is false is false, and what is true has never changed\" (W-pII.10.1:1). \"How simple is salvation! All it says is what was never true is not true now, and never will be. The impossible has not occurred, and can have no effects. And that is all\" (T-31.I.1:1-4)."

    "text_input": "Q #195: As an athlete, competition is how bills get paid. How do you reconcile beating an opponent and striving daily to get better at beating your opponents as, say, a boxer or football player would? I'm a musician myself and if I allow my skill level to drop below a certain point I lose work. So how do we deal with the challenges of competition and everyday survival and not be aware of dualism?",
    "output": "The focus of our work with A Course in Miracles is not on getting beyond our awareness of dualism; it is in becoming more aware of which teacher we have chosen to guide us in our daily life: the ego or Jesus, and therefore whether we are learning how to reinforce our belief in separation or to undo it. Since there is no hierarchy of illusions, we can learn our lessons of forgiveness in any occupation at all. Competition permeates just about everything in this world, because the world is nothing but the outside picture of the ego thought system of competition in our minds. The ego is in a perpetual state of competition with what it senses as a threat to its very existence. Hence, \"kill or be killed\" describes practically every dimension of physical and psychological existence in the world that is rooted in that thought system. Your role as a musician (the form), thus, can now be seen as a classroom in which--if you choose Jesus or the Holy Spirit as your teacher--you can learn how to undo the separation you ordinarily perceive between you and your colleagues (the content). So you would practice and do whatever you need to do to maintain your competence (the form), but you would do it with Jesus or the Holy Spirit (the content). Your purpose would not be to beat others for a position-- although the form would look like that. Your purpose would be to learn that your interests are not separate from anyone else's, and that gaining or acquiring something at another's expense is truly valueless. Thus you could learn how to compete for first chair in the orchestra--for example--while at the same time learning that the only thing of real value is perceiving yourself and every other person in the orchestra as part of the one Son of God. You would go about it differently, in other words. Your attitude or the content in your mind is what would have changed. Ultimately, it makes no difference whether one person is a better musician than another. In principle, we can practice the Course in any role whatsoever. \"There is no order of difficulty in miracles. One is not 'harder' or 'bigger' than another\" (T-1.I.1:1-2). So it is perfectly possible to learn the Course while playing football or being a boxer. There have been many examples of professional athletes who played their sport in a \"gentlemanly\" manner, and were still ranked among the best. Finally, we always need to guard against judging our own or another's spiritual progress based on form, as it is impossible for us to see in its totality our own or anyone else's Atonement path. Perhaps being a defensive lineman on a football team is the role a mind has chosen in which to learn the valuelessness of victory or the insignificance of the body. In principle, we cannot rule this out. Analogously, the Bhagavad Gita tells the story of Krishna advising Arjuna to be the best warrior he can be, because that is his dharma. \"How can the immortal die?\" Krishna reminds Arjuna, who was troubled by his having to kill others."

    "output": "Your question seems to be open to at least two interpretations. You may mean that you have assumed the victimizer role later in life in your relationships as an adult. But you may also mean that you have reinterpreted your victim experiences as a child and have chosen to see yourself as having some responsibility, even control, in those situations so that in some sense you have victimized your abusers (e.g., unwanted pregnancy, difficult childbirth, chronic childhood illnesses). Or perhaps there is yet another meaning you intended. But regardless of your specific meaning, the answer is basically the same. When we see ourselves acting as the victimizer, we are always feeling at some level that our attacks are justified as a defense against the victimization we have suffered at those times when we have been more helpless, less powerful. Our desire is to seize power as a protection against those outside forces so that what has happened to us in the past can not happen again, even at the risk of seeing the sin and guilt in us as well. But always, at least at an unconscious level, we are continuing to identify with the victim role for, as A Course in Miracles says, \"All defenses do what they would defend\" (T-17.IV.7:1). Whether we are arrogating power in the present or reinterpreting the past to claim that power in retrospect is all the same--our goal is to defend ourselves against feeling vulnerable and at risk. But we never question the assumption that we are vulnerable and at risk, which can only come from a case of mistaken identity--seeing ourselves as this limited physical self. This dynamic is described in the section \"Self-Concept versus Self,\" which comes near the end of the text. In talking about the face of innocence, Jesus observes, \"This aspect never makes the first attack. But every day a hundred little things make small assaults upon its innocence, provoking it to irritation, and at last to open insult and abuse. The face of innocence the concept of the self so proudly wears can tolerate attack in self-defense, for is it not a well-known fact the world deals harshly with defenseless innocence?\" (T-31.V.3:3-4; 4:1). We all defend against the sin and guilt of separation buried deep in our minds with a variety of strategies. To understand how these strategies work, we must recognize that the goal with each is to keep ourselves mindless. That is, we keep our focus on the world we seem to live in and our reactions to it, rather than ever getting in touch with the real guilt buried deep in our mind, which has nothing to do with the external world. Being abused as a child is one part of the strategy, but striking out against others as a defense against the powerlessness we feel over having been abused is simply another. But once we uncover the truth that they are flip sides of the same ego coin, we can now be open to another choice, at a completely different level. Victim and victimizer are both false roles we assume to keep the separation alive and real in our mind. But when we look on both of them as equally untrue, the truth of Who we are--the innocent Son of an All-loving Father--can at last dawn upon our minds."

    "output": "To quote from the clarification of terms of A Course in Miracles: \"The term 'soul' is not used except in direct biblical quotations because of its highly controversial nature. It would, however, be an equivalent of 'spirit,' with the understanding that, being of God, it is eternal and was never born\" (C-1.3:2-3). The term \"soul\" can also be equated with mind in the Course, the split mind. Jesus frequently refers to our spiritual process as a journey on which we have embarked, and that it surely encompasses more than one lifetime. We can say in this sense that our \"souls\" move on."

    "text_input": "Q #199: Yesterday I experienced something that probably could be termed existential fear; fear without any external cause, but so intensive that it made me physically sick. I was able to look at it for a second or two and go beyond it and sense a great release. These brief moments brought a lot of pain followed by a feeling of freedom, so that I tried to evoke this cycle again and again. Today I realized that sensing this fear was very important, but I cannot do it myself any more, I cannot go through this threshold alone. Also, I realized that I never seriously asked Jesus or the Holy Spirit for help. They do not exist within my reach. How can I ask for help if I see them as total abstractions (opposed to how I see myself--specific individual!)? I wonder if in such situations it would be possible to seek for help from other people without getting my ego involved?",
    "output": "The experience you describe, especially since it included a release from the fear, is a helpful one. And the fact that you experienced release means you were not going through this process alone, whether or not you consciously invoked the Holy Spirit or Jesus for help. Your ego mind will want you to dismiss their accessibility to you, especially after such experiences as you describe, so that you will not trust that you have help already available. You may see Jesus and the Holy Spirit as total abstractions, but they can be as specific in your mind as you want and need them to be. You only need to ask them. Jesus himself, at the end of the workbook, assures us, \"Of this be sure; that I will never leave you comfortless\" (W-pII.ep.6:8). There is also nothing wrong with seeking help and support from another specific individual person as long as that is how you perceive yourself. You would want to be sure you ask someone who is open-minded and nonjudgmental and who can recognize the value of what you are experiencing--and that need not be a student of A Course in Miracles. But a caution to consider, that you don't make repetition of the experience a goal in itself. The lessons of forgiveness can take many different forms, and this kind of experience is only one of them. If it will be helpful and you are willing, more opportunities will present themselves. But in the meantime, any of the more specific forms of fear-- which may show up as anxiety, anger, pain, stress, depression, etc.--are just as valuable in the process of healing your mind and releasing the fear."

    "text_input": "Q #200: I am in my first year with A Course in Miracles. I was sexually molested as a child. The severe shame I feel from this has made relationships difficult. With each new failure to keep or maintain a relationship, they seem to become progressively more difficult. I don't mind being in the constant process of forgiving the perpetrators. But my life struggle seems to be in sustaining forgiveness of myself. Is there any way I can address this specifically in my renewed relationship with God?",
    "output": "It is your ego that has convinced you that the shame you feel now is the result of those traumatic and shameful abusive experiences of your childhood. That way, the problem remains in the past, never really capable of being undone. But you are not alone in thinking this way. This is the purpose of the world, to keep our focus away from the real problem in the mind, the original and only source of guilt and shame, and on events in our lives that have happened to us and cannot be reversed. This is not to say that those childhood experiences were not horrific or that you don't continue to be haunted by thoughts related to those experiences. But what the Course offers you now is another way in the present of looking at all of that so that it need not maintain the grip on your life and your mind that it has up until now. The guilt buried deep in our mind over the thought that we would want to and could separate ourselves from love is the real source of all of our shame. And it is a shame so severe that we believe that we do not deserve to be loved, that a lifetime beginning with abuse by those who are responsible for us is a fitting punishment for our \"crime\" of assaulting love. We carry the belief that we are somehow fatally flawed and that is the real cause of our shame. But we never go back and look at that source of shame in our mind, where with the gentle support of Jesus, God's symbol of love in our mind, we might begin to question the validity of that original self-accusation. Instead, we shift our focus to the world of bodies and the shame associated with being helpless and abused by others over whom we have no power or control. And then this seems to be the shame that poisons our whole life, and all the relationships we embark upon in search of the love that is missing that we yearn for. But the good news of the Course is that the problem is not where we are seeing it, in the world of bodies, but rather in our minds, where the solution--forgiveness--is as well. And so this is where your renewed relationship with God and His representative, Jesus, and his Course, offers hope. For as you are willing to uncover the deeper ontological guilt and shame that your lifetime of personal shame is pointing to, looking at it with Jesus' love beside you, you will gradually allow yourself to recognize that there is nothing to be ashamed of. For with his love there with you, you will begin to recognize that you have not abandoned or betrayed love, and love has not abandoned or betrayed you.

    "output": "The journey of our \"return\" is a process of walking backwards, starting from the place where we think we are, which is in the body, in the world, in the dream. Though the original choice to separate from God is indeed unremembered, we seem to be experiencing the very real effects of that choice. Looking clearly and directly at the effects will indicate the true nature of the mistaken choice of believing in the reality of the separation. Our return begins when we are willing to look at any situation differently. Any person, event, condition or situation that seems to cause us pain, discomfort, or lack of peace is an opportunity for us to question what is really going on. A Course in Miracles tells us that the conflict experienced here in the dream is really caused by the guilt in our mind which is being displaced from our mind and projected onto the body or the world. The purpose of the projection is to free us of the responsibility for having made the choice to separate. The ego, on the other hand, tells us that persons and events outside of us are to blame for our misery. We have been victimized by outside agents and cannot be held responsible. Through the process of forgiveness we learn to identify the cause of our problems as a choice in the mind rather than to blame others. This is one level of returning to the point at which the error was made. In this way, the people we hold grievances against are cleared of responsibility; thus they are forgiven for what \"they did not do\" (T-17.III.1:5). When we have been able to practice forgiveness with everyone, and every situation in our lives, and have disidentified sufficiently with the ego's belief in separation, we will identify fully with the mind rather than the body. We will no longer believe in victimization, but in the power of our mind's ability to choose. This will free us to make a different choice. Instead of the error of believing that the separation was real and has had serious consequences, we will laugh gently at the absurdity of such a thought. This is the final return to the \"point at which the error was made.\" We will then awaken from the dream of separation. Meanwhile, every time we are willing to recognize any situation, or the dynamics of any relationship, as the direct result of a choice made in our mind, without projecting blame onto others, we are strengthening our belief in our true identity as mind, and weakening our belief in the ego's tale of separation and identity with the body. We are thus led to the point of final choice, and the decision to return no more to the darkened world of illusion and separation."

    "text_input": "Q #202: I am a professional who works with kids. I have wondered what are some basics of A Course in Miracles that you all talk about when it comes to working with children, as a parent, teacher, counselor, coach, or whatever role is in use. I use \"what do you want to come out of this?\" Unfortunately, most kids are not conscious enough to answer that question with much wisdom. I also emphasize the role of \"choice.\" What else?",
    "output": "We addressed this issue in #179 in the context of parenting. It is always a good thing to help children (as well as adults) to accept responsibility for their behavior, and to help them realize that choices are available to them; but the concepts and principles of the Course are far beyond what children and most adolescents are capable of grasping. Children must first learn to become strong, healthy egos in order to function effectively and to cope with the many challenges in world. A basically sound level of psychological stability is necessary before anyone can \"safely\" begin to deal with the concept of the world and individuality as illusions. Immature or psychologically fragile people can be thrown into a panic, or far worse, if they are inappropriately confronted with such topics. The best way to teach the Course to children is to demonstrate it in our own lives. The focus should always be on the content in our minds--watching for, and then bringing to the love of Jesus, all of our ego thoughts and dynamics: for example, our need to control, dominate, or cannibalize (psychologically) others; our need to manipulate and use others to get what we want and then dispense with them. When we humbly acknowledge that we have been wrong in our choice of teachers, and then choose the teacher of forgiveness in our right minds, we will automatically manifest the message of the Course in our lives. The words we say do not matter, because if we are centered in the love of Jesus, then whatever we do or say will be loving and the most helpful to the children in our care. Children will connect with the source of our words or actions, and consequently they will feel safe and accepted regardless of what they do. When discipline is called for, if we have let go of our ego for just an instant, our behavior will be conducted in a manner that is appropriately firm and effective, but not punitive, retaliative, judgmental, condescending, nor triggered by anger or by fear. Again, the message the children will get--after their normal period of pouting--is that they are cared for and accepted, even though what they just did was not acceptable. We all can attest to the fact that the teachers and adults who stand out in our memories of our childhood are those who were kind and caring and accepting of us, or were just the opposite. The words they said have probably been forgotten-- except for those perhaps that manifested acceptance or rejection. Children immediately tune into the message being transmitted through the adult's words and behavior. Jesus asks us to be like him, to take him as our model. And therefore the way we teach our children is to be a model for them of our right minds. A helpful paragraph to study in this regard is under \"The Function of the Teacher of God\" in the manual (M-5.III.2)."

    "text_input": "Q #203: A group of friends and I are reading A Course in Miracles, and we want to know whether the lessons must be strictly done daily, or if you may stay with some of them for a week or two, until you grasp them deeply?",
    "output": "The only specifications for the Workbook practice are given in its Introduction. It does not say not to repeat a lesson, it only says: \"Do not undertake to do more than one set of exercises a day\" (W-in.2:6). It is therefore not out of keeping with the Workbook instructions to repeat a lesson. If it is a particularly meaningful or difficult lesson, it might be a good idea to stay with it for a couple of days. However, there is a risk in thinking that a lesson needs to be done perfectly, or even \"grasped deeply\" before moving on to the next lesson. This would be a trap, because it is unlikely that many of us will ever do one of the lessons perfectly. If we could, we would have reached such an advanced state of spiritual growth that we would not need the lessons at all. The best thing is to try to do what the lesson asks as best you can, being aware of the resistance that comes up. Resistance is what makes the lesson impossible to remember; it is behind our forgetting the repetitions, and our difficulty in understanding the lesson. It is important to recognize this, as a demonstration of our unwillingness to learn the thought system the Workbook teaches, and of our refusal to allow our minds to be trained \"to a different perception of everyone and everything in the world\" (W-in.4:1). If we mistakenly believe we can master a lesson in a few days, we are underestimating our attachment to the ego's thought system, and this will hinder our progress rather than help it. The important thing is to be sincere in our attempts to study and practice what the Workbook teaches, aware that we are full of resistance, and willing to forgive ourselves for our often mediocre efforts. As long as we continue to study and apply the lessons as we are instructed, we will make progress. It may be helpful for your group to occasionally reread the workbook instructions together. It keeps us on track to go back to the beginning once in a while."

    "output": "It all depends on your definition of the word happiness. If your definition is \"a state of well- being and contentment\" based on getting what you want, whenever you want it, no matter what the cost, or to whom, then the answer is no. If, however, your definition is \"a state of well-being and contentment\" based on the knowledge of who you truly are, then the answer is yes. As you can see, one definition relies on external sources, while the other relies on internal sources. Imagine every grievance you now have completely washed away. Imagine \"gliding\" through your day, with no impingement from outside sources. Imagine freedom from conflict, of any kind. Imagine knowing you are without sin and released of guilt. Imagine finding the innocence you thought was surely lost. Imagine everyone you meet as a brother you dearly love. Such a life comes from the peace of mind you will have once forgiveness has become perfected within you. This \"happiness\" is the goal of the Course."

    "text_input": "Q #205: I may be wrong in this interpretation, but A Course in Miracles seems to be saying that none of us will enter into Heaven alone. Does this mean that every soul that thinks it is separate must accept and live the Atonement before anyone goes to Heaven? What happens to the souls that have not accepted the Atonement when the body is laid aside?",
    "output": "Yes, A Course in Miracles does say that \"no one can enter Heaven by himself\" (W- pI.134.17:7). But this does not mean that \"every soul that thinks it is separate must accept and live the Atonement before anyone goes to Heaven.\" Jesus is correcting our faulty thinking that we are separate, autonomous individuals, and that we can, for example, condemn others without having that judgment affect ourselves. Thus, preceding the above quotation, he says \"In everything you do remember this: No one is crucified alone\" (W-pI.134.17:7). Similarly: \"Brother, you need forgiveness of your brother, for you will share in madness or in Heaven together. And you and he will raise your eyes in faith together, or not at all\" (T-19.IV-D.12:7-8). The point of the teaching is that we are joined as one Sonship, so that we are mistaken anytime we think: I am worthy of passing through the gate of Heaven, but this other person or group is not and never will be; or, this other person is worthy and I am not. Jesus is helping us restore our minds to their original state as Christ, the one Son of God. He is using our language to get us beyond our usual way of perceiving, which is always grounded in separation, division, individuality, and linear time. The process is not linear. There is no \"waiting.\" That is how we would envision the process from our perspective in time and space; but the process is entirely outside our temporal framework, and therefore not something we can fully understand. There is only the illusion of many unhealed minds. There is only one mind that is in need of healing, and that is yours. If you can keep that as your focus as you practice the Course, you will indeed learn its lessons and integrate its message. Finally, it is not necessary to lay the body aside in order to accept the Atonement. The body would just be properly perceived, i.e., as a thought that has never left its source in the mind. Jesus knew he was not his body, and therefore never suffered. Things happened to his body, but they did not happen to him. That is why he asks to take him as our model. He did not perceive himself as victimized. His mind was healed. Lesson 226 describes this from a different angle, but it is the same idea: \"If I so choose, I can depart this world entirely. It is not death which makes this possible, but it is change of mind about the purpose of the world. If I believe it has a value as I see it now, so will it still remain for me. But if I see no value in the world as I behold it, nothing that I want to keep as mine or search for as a goal, it will depart from me. For I have not sought for illusions to replace the truth\" (W-pII.226.1)."

  {
    "text_input": "Q #206: A Course in Miracles seems to suggest that we watch our thoughts every day. Can you give examples of how to put into practice forgiveness on a daily basis?",
    "output": "In general, practicing forgiveness involves looking at your ego thoughts without judgment, and becoming increasingly aware of the price you are paying to hold onto these ego/wrong- minded thoughts. The kinds of thoughts Jesus asks you to watch for are thoughts of judgment or condemnation; thoughts of anger/rage/annoyance; thoughts of vulnerability, victimization, fear, guilt, anxiety, depression; special love or special hate thoughts; any specific thoughts that keep you feeling separate from others. The lessons in the workbook give specific instructions about how to practice searching your mind for these thoughts, and then what to do once you become aware of them--this varies according to the theme of the day's lesson. Some examples: (1) If you are angry or annoyed with someone, you might simply remind yourself that your anger is not really about what you think it's about--\"I am never upset for the reason I think\" (Lesson 5). Then you might continue with: I rejected the love of Jesus again, judged myself for it, felt guilty over it, and then rather than smile at such foolishness, I listened to my ego and projected the guilt onto X. That is why I am feeling angry. Regardless of what this other person has done, my anger is an interpretation. Now I have a choice. I can simply ask for help to let go of my guilt and strive to see shared interests, or I can continue to blame this person for my being upset and feel that my anger is justified. And if I choose to continue to judge and blame, that's okay. I will never feel peaceful or happy for very long if I do that, but that does not make me sinful or unworthy of Heaven's Love. In Lesson 134, Jesus asks us to \"briefly consider all the evil things you thought of him [the person at whom your anger is directed], and each time ask yourself, 'Would I accuse myself of doing this?'\" (W-pI.134.15:3). If you find yourself anxious or fearful about your own or a loved one's well-being (e.g., physical, psychological, financial problems, or any form of victimization), ask for help from the Holy Spirit or Jesus to see the problem as it is, not the way you have set it up (T-27.VII.2:2). In other words, you could remind yourself again that you must be looking through the ego's eyes, which are programmed to see innocent victims; because if you had chosen the Holy Spirit or Jesus as your Teacher, you would not be anxious or fearful, regardless of what is going on. Perception is always interpretation. The miracle \"merely looks on devastation, and reminds the mind that what it sees is false\" (W-pII.13.1:3). So you look on devastation--you do not deny what your eyes are seeing nor how you are feeling--but then you just remind yourself that you have chosen to ask the ego instead of Jesus to interpret what you are looking on. A wonderful way of going about this is described in the last paragraph of Chapter 5 in the text, which concludes with a series of statements Jesus asks us to think of whenever we are not wholly joyous. It begins with \"I must have decided wrongly, because I am not at peace\" (T-5.VII.6). Forgiveness always involves our admitting that we are wrong, and that we are willing to make a different choice. We need not make the other choice; but we must at least acknowledge that we are wrong in how we are seeing things. When our fear lessens over a period of time, we will gladly and quickly make the right choice as soon as we become aware of our wrong-minded thinking. If you are caught in a special relationship, feeling completely dependent on something or someone, and terrified of being without this source of comfort, pleasure, assurance, companionship, conflict, etc., then once again you can start by being honest about what is going on. Jesus asks for complete honesty with ourselves and with him: \"Watch carefully and see what it is you are really asking for. Be very honest with yourself in this, for we must hide nothing from each other\" (T-4.III.8:1-2). The honesty would come in your acknowledging that you are not yet ready to accept the love of Jesus in your mind as your only reality; and therefore you have latched on to something outside your mind to supply the lack, and satisfy your needs as you have defined them. Not judging yourself for doing so would help you move along in your process of undoing your guilt. Being completely honest with yourself about the purpose of the relationship with the other person, object, or conditions is an essential part of the forgiveness process. When you focus on the purpose of the relationship, you are helping yourself prepare for the shift in purpose from the ego to the Holy Spirit, when you are ready to ask for His help. In other words, right now you are seeing yourself as limited and needy--not as God created you-- and you are seeing this other person, substance, etc., as there to fulfill your needs, which constitutes an attack. The separation is thereby being reinforced. That is the purpose of the ego; so whenever you identify with the ego, because you are too fearful of the Love of God, that is what you will do. That does not make you a sinner, however! Heaven's Love cannot be changed by our insanity."

    "text_input": "Q #207: Does the very fact that we have questions and need answers just play into the hands of the ego and perpetuate it? But, also, isn't it unrealistic to live under the premise of A Course in Miracles that we don't know what anything means and we need do nothing, when all we ever do is question and want to do something?",
    "output": "Yes, it is true that our questioning and need for answers perpetuates the ego. There is a powerful section in the text that discusses this: \"The Quiet Answer\" (T-27.IV). There Jesus explains why this is so: \"All questions asked within this world are but a way of looking, not a question asked ... The world asks but one question. It is this: 'Of these illusions, which of them is true?' ... Thus is all questioning within the world a form of propaganda for itself\" (T-27.IV.4:1,4,5; 5:3). But he does not say not to ask questions; he just wants us to ask an honest question, which can occur only when, for an instant, we have set aside our arrogant presumption that we know what our problems are, e.g., our diminishing savings, our diseased body, our disabled car, our devastated environment, etc. Practicing the Course does not mean that we would not attend to these areas of our lives; it means, rather, that we would realize that we are not upset or in distress for these reasons. Our distress--our only problem--is our willingness to continue to believe that we are truly separate from the Love of God; and our defense against our ever changing our minds about that--lest we forego our special identities as individuals--is to see a multitude of problems outside our minds and then ask Jesus or the Holy Spirit to join with us in doing everything possible to solve those problems, instead of asking Them to help us to change our minds about the thought system we have chosen to guide us. In this context, then, it is not unrealistic to live under the Course premises. In fact, we would be far better off and far more peaceful if we did. Those premises are simply re-orienting our thinking; they are helping us to step back from what we are so convinced is reality, so that we can acquire a different perspective on our lives and all of our seeming problems. If we stepped back with Jesus, as he asks that we do, we would see with him that all of our problems are made up; their purpose is to serve as defenses against our ever getting back to the truth that is concealed in our minds. Once we are willing to view our problems that way, we would approach them entirely differently. But as long as we think we know what everything means and act automatically on that basis, we will be stuck forever in an unending cycle of problems that are never totally solved, or are solved and then immediately replaced with other problems. The ego's strategy to keep us mindless would have worked. So Jesus is training us to recognize that we have already chosen a set of premises on which to base our lives, and that it has resulted in unhappiness, frustration, and death. He is therefore teaching us that there is another choice available to us in our minds, which will lead us back home to eternal life and peace in God. The starting point in this reversal is our humble acknowledgment that we have been wrong about everything, and that it would be in our best interests to do nothing on our own, and to ask for help to see all things as he does. If this is done correctly, with gentleness and with trust, we can continue to carry out all of our responsibilities and obligations in the roles we have chosen, so that no one would notice any difference in us, except that we would be more peaceful and we would smile more frequently."

    "text_input": "Q #208: T-2.VI.4:9 says, \"Before you choose to do anything, ask me if your choice is in accord with mine.\" When I first began studying A Course in Miracles I thought this statement meant that before we did anything in this world we were to ask Jesus whether or not we should. Now, with some growth, I don't really know what the statement means (or much of anything else for that matter.) Can you elaborate?",
    "output": "The Course teaches us that since we have a split mind, there are two ways of perceiving in the dream: the ego's and the Holy Spirit's. They are referred to as our \"teachers\" or as \"voices\" in our mind. It also tells us that everything serves one of two goals: the ego's or the Holy Spirit's. Every choice we make, therefore, is in accord with one of these two perceptions, and serves one of these two goals. The statement you quote is asking us to be aware, in everything that we choose to think or do, which \"teacher\" we are listening to, and what purpose, or goal, our choice serves. This refers to the choice we are making in the mind, not in form. Choosing with the ego will always reinforce the belief that the separation, the world, and the body are real, and will result in some degree of conflict. The ego's goal is to keep us in our deep sleep in the world of illusion. Choosing with the Holy Spirit will always bring peace, and strengthen our awareness that we are mind, not body. This choice leads us to the mind, so that we can learn to make the only real choice--accepting the separation thought as real or not real. This process has nothing to do with the \"choice\" we seem to be making in the world of form. Needing to make choices and decisions in the world is a helpful reminder to us that we are always choosing between the lies of the ego and the light of the Holy Spirit. The other important factor is that we must choose, there is no in between: \"Vision or judgment is your choice, but never both of these\" (T-20.V.4:7). In a statement such as the one you quote, the Course is asking us to ask ourselves whether we are seeking to further our progress on our journey home to God, or whether we are seeking to reinforce our identity as a separate self. In a later chapter we are told: \"In any situation in which you are uncertain, the first thing to consider, very simply, is 'What do I want to come of this? What is it for?' The clarification of the goal belongs at the beginning, for it is this which will determine the outcome\" (T-17.VI.2:1-3). In other words, \"whom am I listening to?\" The outcome of peace or conflict reveals who the teacher is, and also reflects what we truly want. The ultimate outcome brings us closer to the decision not to deny God or, to remain entrenched in the illusion of separation. It is important to remember that A Course in Miracles is never referring to form, and is always addressing the mind, not the body which is the figure in the dream."

Sometimes I do feel Jesus' presence, both in meditation and in other everyday situations. Now instead I felt the presence of the Dalai Lama. I had been reading a book by him the day before, so coming to think of him should not have been surprising. But it scared me--I didn't dare to explore this further. After that I decided to take it easy with practicing----not doing lessons, only meditating morning and night. But then a couple of days ago, while watching a movie, I was reminded of Marianne Williamson, and felt her presence. I didn't want to explore this either. Both incidents I think of as not true in the sense that I do not think that either the Dalai Lama or Marianne Williamson were really there.  : Is this kind of experience something you have run into? What does it possibly mean? How can one handle it?  : If I feel this need, which I do, to dismiss these \"presences\" as fantasies, why should I not just as easily dismiss the presence of Jesus? I mean, I don't, not in truth. But I still feel that dismissing one experience reflects on the other, and I'm not sure how to handle it.",
    "output": "Your experiences are not the problem, but your interpretation that they are somehow unnatural and undesirable is what is causing you your problem. Your wily ego is only doing what any self- serving ego will want to do-- undermine any experiences that may reflect a different reality. And, of course, distract you from practicing the Course and its workbook lessons. If, as the Course teaches, we are all thoughts or ideas (T-15.VI.4:5), and minds are all joined (e.g., T-18.VI.3:1; T-28.III.3:1; W-pI.19.2:1), then everyone is present to us all the time. What is artificial and unnatural is the belief that we are bodies, separated by time and space. But to question that assumption is to begin to question the basic assumptions of the ego thought system that keep this world in place and ultimately keep us mindless. And so whether you experience the presence of Jesus, the Dalai Lama, Marianne Williamson, or someone else, if you have accepted the guidance of the Holy Spirit, you will know that, as symbols of love, they are all the same, for we are all one. In the words of one of those workbook lessons you have recently been avoiding, \"One brother is all brothers. Every mind contains all minds, for every mind is one. Such is the truth\" (W-pI.161.4:1-3)."

    "output": "Our minds are split between the part that identifies with the ego thought system of separation (wrong-mindedness) and the part that identifies with the Holy Spirit's thought system of forgiveness (right-mindedness). We are constantly choosing between the two thought systems, although we generally are not aware of making this choice. That is the point of the training in the Course: first, to help us catch the thoughts that precede our experience, which, in the workbook lessons, Jesus refers to as the process of mind searching, where we would observe what is going on in our minds. Then eventually, we would be able to catch ourselves choosing either the ego or the Holy Spirit as our teacher. This is a process that continues throughout our lives. You perhaps are referring to the fear that we experience when we ask for help to change our teacher from the ego to Jesus or the Holy Spirit. That could be perceived as a struggle in which we are attracted to the healing love in our right minds, but are still reluctant to let go of everything else. We always are identified with one or the other, though, and over a period of time we would become more and more clear about which one we have chosen. We go back and forth between our right mind and our wrong mind, but there is no neutral state. If we are observing our inner state with the ego, then we would be fearful, judgmental, or self-glorifying. If we are observing our inner state with Jesus, we would be peaceful, non-judgmental, and patient, knowing that we are in the process of undoing something that never happened, and therefore we would not take any of our thoughts all that seriously."

    "text_input": "Q #211: Is it possible to get a disease if you have no knowledge of its existence, and therefore no fear of it?",
    "output": "Yes, it is. And if you think about it, you can see that it happens all the time, from the very first cases of new diseases such as AIDS or SARS, before they are identified in the media, to illnesses that affect children congenitally or very early in life, before we would see them as having any \"knowledge\" of the disease. So how does this happen, in light of A Course in Miracles' teachings on how we choose our illnesses? All diseases and illnesses in the body are the effects of a decision made in the mind (W-pI.136.2- 5), not the brain. Like every other decision about what happens to us in our lifetime, these decisions are made outside of time and space. The brain that we believe--incorrectly--is the seat of consciousness and decision-making is only an effect. Much of what is contained in the mind remains out of our conscious awareness, but at a deeper level we do know all of its contents. It is our fear of the power of our mind however that keeps it all buried (T-2.VI.9), so that our defenses can work and we do not seem to be responsible for the things that happen to us--we can see ourselves as victims of forces beyond our control. In that way, the pain that comes from our choosing the thought of separation seems instead to come from what others do to us. And our guilt over separation remains buried and protected, along with the thought of separation. Having said this, we also need to be clear that the goal is not to make the unconscious conscious so that we can make better choices for our body's health and well-being. It is not really fear of the illness itself that causes us to choose it--we actually want the illness for its value as a defense. Our goal is to learn over time to forgive ourselves for the illusory guilt over separation. For it is this guilt that we believe calls for punishment, which in turn demonstrates that the guilt and separation are serious and real. And that punishment can assume many different forms, disease being just one among many. So the problem is not the punishment, what ever form it may take, but our mistaken belief in our guilt. And that is what we want to make conscious. For that is where the only real healing can occur. For a related discussion, see also #117."

    "text_input": "Q #212: I have a question about judgment. Let's say I walk by a home which has dogs behind a fence and the dogs bark at me and I recognize they believe I am a threat; yet I do not feel resentful, but wish they knew I mean them no harm. Am I still judging them? Is there a difference between a \"mechanical judgment\" and a judgment based on emotion? Is a  \"mechanical judgment\" the same as resentment, even if I feel no malice? How should I view such distinctions about judgment?",
    "output": "The kind of judgment that A Course in Miracles focuses on, almost exclusively, is the judgment in which we condemn ourselves or another person in some way, or the judgment that presumes that we know everything and therefore can reach valid conclusions about everything. If you find yourself insisting that you are right about something, or feeling superior or inferior, better or worse than someone else--any comparative judgment along those lines--then you have gotten involved with the kind of judgment that needs to be addressed through the process of forgiveness, because your perception is grounded in separation. If you do not feel resentment, if you have no investment in the dogs' accepting your invitation to join with you, and you are feeling only kindness and compassion towards them, then you have not judged. Simply sizing up the situation, i.e., that the dogs are threatened by you even though you mean them no harm, is not the kind of judgment that Jesus wants us to be vigilant about. We all are engaged in judging all the time: for example, judging what outfit is best in terms of the weather forecast; which route to take in order to arrive at our destination on time; which doctor to go to, etc. We cannot avoid judging, and Jesus never tells us not to judge. His emphasis is always on changing our teacher from the ego to him or the Holy Spirit, which would then put us in a position where judgment through us rather than by us can occur (M-10.2:7). This would mean that we would be free of all attack thoughts and thoughts of separation, and we would not be perceiving our interests as separate from everyone else's."

I know that the hatred I feel for her is a projection of the guilt and self-hatred in my mind, and I know that we are both a part of a larger whole. I know that this situation is allowing me to see the hatred in my mind. I have asked Jesus for help to see her differently, but nothing happens. I then ask for help with my resistance to seeing her differently and sometimes I have a shift, but the hatred comes back later. It feels like a solid rock in my heart. I can feel my resistance to letting it go. I know this process takes time and I am continuing to work with it, but meanwhile I am having trouble containing my hatred and hostility toward her on the level of form. Help!",
    "output": "You have a good intellectual understanding of at least part of the process, but there is another step or two you need to consider. You keep asking for help to change your perception of this other person, but that is not the real problem. The change you want help with is in your perception of yourself. For the hatred that you continue to displace outside yourself onto this other person is really directed at yourself. But until you allow yourself to acknowledge and accept this, you will continue to try to direct the hatred outside yourself and will be unwilling to see the other person differently. Once you have acknowledged where the real problem lies--with the guilt within your own mind--the other person will have served the Holy Spirit's purpose of leading you back within yourself and will no longer be your concern. You hate yourself for what you accuse yourself of doing. You believe that you have attacked and destroyed love out of total self-interest, leaving yourself abandoned, hopeless, and bereft of love. And it is with this self-hatred that you really need help. Turning to that presence of love within--Jesus or the Holy Spirit, using symbols of A Course in Miracles--will have to begin to undo your self-accusation. For how could you have destroyed love if it is still there within you? And so, through joining with that love, you will begin to question the justification for your self-hatred over destroying love. That is the shift in perception with which you need the help, for you can't make it on your own. And as the self-hatred within your own mind begins to dissolve, you will no longer need to project it. And then you will see those outside of you as simply caught in their own attempts to project their own self-hatred outside themselves. But rather than reacting from your own guilt, if you have released it, you can only respond with compassion and kindness. If you fail to look within, you will not be addressing the source of the resistance to releasing your judgment and condemnation. The key is, whatever you first see within yourself is what you will then see outside yourself, and so your focus for change only needs to be within."

    "text_input": "Q #214: When A Course in Miracles refers to the \"many thousands of other forms\" of the universal curriculum in the manual, what does it mean, exactly? Since there are not that many religions, does it count such \"paths\" as music, or the love of nature, as possible ways home?",
    "output": "\"Many thousands\" is not meant to be taken literally, it simply means \"a large number.\" It is also not necessarily referring to religious paths in an inclusive way. Religion may be a path for some, it may be a deterrent for others, and it may even be used as an attack. The important message in this section is that there is only one outcome-- God; only one content in our learning--undoing our belief in the thought of separation from God, but many, many forms, for accomplishing this. In fact, any form can reflect this choice made in the mind. What actually occurs is a decision in the mind to no longer choose the ego, which is a choice not to deny God. This choice is then manifest in the dream, in all the forms that make up an individual's life situation. It begins with an awareness that there are no separate interests. This can come about in \"thousands\" of different ways. A good example of this is Helen Schucman and Bill Thetford's decision to \"find a better way\" of relating with their colleagues at Columbia Medical Center together. They were not consciously seeking a spiritual path to God. They were truly no longer interested in continuing the discord and conflict in their work environment, and, they were sincere in their decision to seek together. This decision was made in the mind and became manifest for them in the dream in this form, and ultimately in the form of A Course in Miracles. The section in the manual that you are referring to speaks of this in the definition of the teacher of God: \" ... somehow, somewhere he has made a deliberate choice in which he did not see his interests as apart from someone else's\" (M-1.1:2). It is this content that is the path to return home to God, regardless of the form it may take in the dream. It is very important to make this distinction between form and content in order to understand the rest of the description: \"He has entered an agreement with God even if he does not yet believe in Him....They come from all over the world. They come from all religions and from no religion. They are the ones who have answered. The Call is universal. It goes on all the time everywhere\" (M-1.1:6; 2:1-5 italics added). Clearly then, neither religion nor belief in God are required for one to be on the path to God. \"Many thousands of other forms\" can actually be restated as \"any form,\" because the form does not matter. It merely reflects a decision made in the mind. When the decision for God is made completely: \"There is no path that does not lead to Him\" (T-31.IV.11:7). On the other hand, however beautiful, or religious a form may be, without this content it will lead nowhere."

    "text_input": "Q #215: The Song of Prayer says that praying for material things is not what prayer is (S-II). This is only a call for hiding our guilt and a call for enemy (our own). Then is the correct way of praying a prayer of gratitude only? How do we deal with our internal desires? If our only goal is knowing God, how do I pray? Should I be in silence? Praying with others is then both looking to God? How do I deal with wishful thinking?",
    "output": "This beautiful scribed piece The Song of Prayer came in response to the way in which students of A Course in Miracles were using the Course. Many students thought that the Course was telling them to ask Jesus or the Holy Spirit to heal their bodies, fix things, solve problems in the world, and get them what they wanted. So Jesus teaches us in The Song of Prayer what true prayer is. He tells us, first, that it is not wrong to ask for material things; and in fact, as long as we think we are individuals living in the world, we cannot avoid praying that way (S-II.2:3). Prayer, he says, is like a ladder that we are climbing, and as we make our way up, our prayer will take a different form, because our needs will change. We will have less and less guilt as we practice forgiveness, and \"without guilt there is no scarcity. The sinless have no needs\" (S-II.3:5- 6). Thus, at the top of the ladder--when we are advanced teachers of God--we will not experience lack of any kind, we will not perceive separation, and therefore our prayer will be just a song of gratitude. But that is at the top of the ladder. On the lower rungs of the ladder, we experience all kinds of needs and desires. That is normal. We need to be gentle about that and not deny them. If we are honest, and we acknowledge that they are coming from a faulty perception of ourselves, we will not be held back by them. Asking for specifics is not wrong; and feeling guilty about the fact that we have needs and desires is never helpful, nor is fighting against them. We need only say \"That is where I am right now; and when I am less fearful, I will allow more love to come in, and I will not experience lack or scarcity.\" It is so important to remember that this is not a course in sacrifice or asceticism. This is a slow process, a gentle one, and we do not jump from the bottom of the ladder right up to the top. There are many steps in between, and if we are doing the best we can wherever we are, nothing more is ever asked of us. As we practice forgiveness, the form of our prayer will change of itself. Our prayer on the lower rungs is always to ourselves, that we would ask the help of Jesus or the Holy Spirit to look gently and without judgment at our ego thoughts, and to see our interests as shared with everyone else's. When we have \"enemies,\" we have already seen our interests as separate from, and in conflict with, others. That is when we need to ask for help to have our own minds be healed through forgiveness. When our need to have an enemy is recognized and then healed, we will have advanced closer to our true state of oneness, and then praying with someone will simply be a joyous acknowledgment of our Oneness as Christ, and the Oneness of Christ and God. Asking-out-of-need will no longer have any meaning."

    "text_input": "Q #216: During the 12 years that I have been a student of A Course in Miracles, I have seen a very unsettling pattern. I achieve a temporary state of being that I have yearned for, experiencing real happiness, absence of pain, a wondrous sense of connectedness. Then something really tiny happens in time and I suddenly experience being invaded. Before I know it, all the happiness and sense of balance and love are totally gone. The guilt that follows is more unsettling, and any return to the previous state of mind has become impossible, resulting in a feeling of deep loss. I seem to flow into states of mind of either bright or gentle light, to find myself suddenly thrown back into darkness. Even the darkness emits rays of light. The whole of the pattern is like traveling though a series of experiences that cannot be explained in terms of the world: from black to white and back to black. The effect of the experiences however is to lose respect for myself and others, since my attitudes seem to be swinging to diametrically opposed points of the 'compass'. My question then is: if the goodness I think I experience can be punctured so easily, how real is it, really?",
    "output": "The pattern you describe is not really an unusual one, although the specific form it is taking may be somewhat unique to you. Until we accept the Atonement for ourselves (T-2.V.4:4; T- 9.VII.2; T-14.III.10:1-2), we will continue to alternate between our right mind and our wrong mind. The real problem is not the vacillations you experience but your judgments of them. Certainly, the shifting is likely to be experienced as unsettling, especially while you see yourself as at the mercy of the returns to darkness. What will be helpful to recognize, even if it is just intellectually at first, is that it is your own fear of the light and peace and happiness that plunges you back into the darkness. Jesus knows that this will happen to all of us, observing that \"as the light comes nearer you will rush to darkness, shrinking from the truth, sometimes retreating to the lesser forms of fear, and sometimes to stark terror\" (T-18.III.2:1). There is a decision that you are making, buried deeply in your unconscious, to invite in \"something really tiny\" to disrupt your experience of happiness. For if you allow yourself to continue with this experience indefinitely, all boundaries around the self you think you are will dissolve and you will no longer identify with that self. And that \"loss\" of self is terrifying to any ego-identified mind. Fear and judgment and guilt are the ego's favorite antidotes to experiences of peace and love, for they reinforce our identification with the separate self. After all, it is only a separate self with its self- imposed boundaries that can experience \"being invaded.\" A key in all of this is to recognize that the state of happiness is not something that you need to \"achieve\" and that your yearning for it only denies the power of your own mind to choose against it. If you can ask for help in uncovering your own fear of the light, and begin to observe your vacillations without judgment, without imposing the categories of desirable and undesirable (for all polarities are from the oppositional ego thought system), the power that these negative experiences seem to hold over you will begin to subside. As we travel along the path of forgiveness, we will allow ourselves glimpses of the real unchanging happiness that comes only at the end of our journey. But only when we truly know that we are not the self we now think we are, only when we know we are not in this world and so can not be its victim, will we be open to the real happiness that never changes and the real peace that can never be disturbed."

    "text_input": "Q #217: Given that the prose of A Course in Miracles is not always logical, as in a scientific text, and that the reader must be willing to \"decipher\" so to speak intentional ambiguity--even apparent contradictions--in its message, I have problems sometimes even understanding basic tenets of its teachings. To wit, Lesson 128, \"The world I see holds nothing that I want.\" Should I take this literally or not? If so, should I take this to mean that I have nothing to learn or benefit from existing on this plane? Do I not benefit from seeing kindness, humility, compassion in fellow Sons of God? If, as is stated in paragraph 2, sent. 3 \"The only purpose worthy of your mind this world contains is that you pass it by, without delaying to perceive some hope where there is none\" why don't we all just commit mass suicide and \"move on\" to His palace, so to speak? If not taken literally, it appears there is a built-in conundrum of being told to \"move on,\" yet being trapped in this three-dimensional existence. Could you kindly elaborate?",
    "output": "This is one of those statements that Jesus means quite literally. When he says that passing the world by is the only purpose worthy of our minds, he is simply stating a fact, because he holds our minds in much higher esteem than we ourselves do. And when he says there is no hope in the world, he again is simply stating a fact--we are setting ourselves up for repeated failure and depression if we continue to try to find our happiness in the world. None of this is intended to coerce us or shame us into giving up the world, although the ego would want us to perceive his statements in that light. It is that Jesus simply can offer us no compromise that in any way honors or validates the ego and its effects, when he sees through all its duplicitous deceptions and knows the desolate and desperate outcome that following its dictates must bring to us. That is only kindness on his part, even if we don't perceive it that way yet. Jesus points to the truth, but he always acknowledges the power of our minds to decide for ourselves whether or not to accept his words. And he does not judge us if we do not (T-8.IV.6). So Jesus is not telling us that we must give up the world--he knows we're not yet ready to let it go, although not for the reasons we think we still want it. It's just that from his perspective, which he is trying gently to lead us toward, the world, as an illusory projection of an illusory thought of guilt and attack in the mind, can have no value in itself. Its only value comes from the purpose that we give to it. And so while we believe our reality is on this illusory plane of existence, the world can serve the purpose of providing us our lessons in forgiveness, for it is made of the projected guilt in our minds, now seen outside ourselves. You have suggested there is value in seeing a brother's acts of kindness, humility and compassion, and that is consistent with the Course's view that, while we think we are bodies, they are the means we seem to have for communication with each other. But nevertheless, seeing your brother's acts as kind or humble or compassionate is an interpretation you give to his intentions and not anything intrinsic in the behaviors themselves. Someone else may observe the same behaviors and perceive them in a completely different light--the point being that it is our intentions that affect how we see the world. The only real communication occurs between minds, contrary to what our experience seems to tell us (T-8.VII.2-4). Always, Jesus' goal is to lead us away from a focus on the world and back to the mind, where everything is happening, since ideas do not leave their source (T-26.VII.4:7-9; W-pI.132.10:3). As for mass suicide as a way to leave the world, the Course makes it clear that death is not an answer, since \"life\" in the body in the world is not the problem--guilt in the mind is (see #135 for a much more in depth discussion of suicide from the Course's perspective). And so it always to the mind and its beliefs that Jesus attempts to direct our attention. For there is no trap except the one we have set and ensnared ourselves in, by our own false beliefs about who we are. And by practicing forgiveness--of the world and of ourselves--we can, over time, release ourselves from the chains of guilt we seem to have made to imprison ourselves."

It was put in by Jesus specifically to alleviate this friend's anxiety about visions of light that he was finding quite frightening; thus, \"Do not be afraid of them\" (W-pI.15.3:3). (See Absence from Felicity, under \"Bill's Journal.\") Although the reference suggests that all students may have these \"light episodes,\" it was not meant to be a criterion of progress with the Course.

    "text_input": "Q #219: How does A Course in Miracles view the issues of demon possession which some religious organizations treat as real? Does the Course really claim that evil does not exist? Does the Course claim that there is no battle between Good and Evil? And, I am sure it states somewhere in the Course, if my memory is correct, that we do not heal but God does. How then does the Course explain faith healers? I am referring to the legitimate cases supported by the Catholic Church, cases involving individuals that have the stigmata. If the crucifixion is not important then why would these people be afflicted with the wounds of the crucifixion?",
    "output": "One of the fundamental differences between Christian theology and A Course in Miracles is the Course teaching that sin is not real. In Christianity, the belief that sin is real is at the root of its entire belief system; it is synonymous with evil. These are, therefore, mutually exclusive teachings, and the beliefs and practices that follow from them are also mutually exclusive. In Christianity, the idea of sin is given different expressions in form, one of which is demon possession. In Christian thought, both sin and evil represent a will in opposition to God's. This is the nature of sin. The Course, on the other hand, teaches that there is no sin, and no opposition to God's Will is possible: \" ... sin is not real, and all that you believe must come from sin [e.g. demon possession] will never happen, for it has no cause. Accept Atonement with an open mind, which cherishes no lingering belief that you have made a devil of God's Son. There is no sin\" (W-pI.101.5:2-4). \"What is opposed to God does not exist ... \" (W-pI.137.11:3). Clearly what does not exist cannot do battle with what is real. According to the Course, only God is real. What appears to do battle in the world is the ego's made-up idea of what is \"good\" conflicting with the ego's made-up idea of what is \"evil.\" This is the battleground that is home to the ego thought system, but the Course tells us that it is not real. The Course teaching in this regard can be summed up: sin is not real, and so there can be no demon personifying sin; evil does not exist, and so there cannot be a battle between good and evil. For a Christian believer, the crucifixion and the wounds of the crucified Jesus are very real. Inspired by devotion to these beliefs, a person with a very deep desire to share the sufferings of the crucifixion as a way of identifying with the historical Jesus could experience the physical manifestation of the wounds of the crucifixion, known as the stigmata. However, even the Catholic Church acknowledges that these physical marks can be caused by an intense psychological state, not divine intervention. This neither negates nor proves the person's devotion. The stigmata has been experienced by persons who were psychologically imbalanced, as well as by those, such as St. Francis of Assisi, who are believed to be a saints. As with everything, the Course brings our focus to the content, never the form. All form, stigmata included, can be the result of the ego's choice to separate, or, the choice to join in the mind with the Holy Spirit, Who reflects God's Love in the dream. The Course does not say the crucifixion was not important; it reinterprets it: \"The message the crucifixion was intended to teach was that it is not necessary to perceive any form of assault in persecution, because you cannot be persecuted\" (T-6.I.4:6). Christianity teaches that God's innocent Son, Jesus, died to atone for the sins of humanity, and thus reopened the gates of Heaven that were shut when Adam and Eve committed the original sin. The Course teaches that the gates of Heaven were never shut, and there is no sin. God's one Son is made up of the entire Sonship, including Jesus (not exclusively Jesus). This one Son cannot be harmed, cannot suffer, and cannot die. All this is true, according to the Course, because the separation never happened, and the world and the body are not real. The events that occurred in the life of the historical Jesus have been interpreted by those who wrote down the Gospels, and by the leaders of religious institutions in accord with their belief system. We who identify with our bodies and believe in suffering and death bring these beliefs to our view of the crucifixion of Jesus. We assume that what would be true for us, if we were crucified, was true for him--that he felt betrayed and victimized, suffered agony, and died. Since Jesus did not identify with the body, and knew his true identity as a Son of God, this was not his experience of the crucifixion. The Course teaches that true healing is of the mind, and only of the mind. This is accomplished through forgiveness, and leads to the undoing of the belief in the separation. This healing will result in peace, and may or may not have any manifestation in form. If true healing of this nature occurs, whatever happens in form is irrelevant. The mind that chooses to believe in the separation and the reality of the body can also choose to make the body sick. The Course is teaching us that another choice is also possible--the mind can choose against sickness. When a person seeks help in healing from a faith healer and the body is healed, it is because a choice for healing was made in the mind. The person then joins with the faith healer in the shared purpose of healing. This is true even when no physical contact occurs (M-5.II.2-4; III.1-2). The choice in the mind of the individual is the only explanation for any healing that occurs. The ultimate healing is awakening from the dream of separation, which is accomplished by undoing our belief in separation. Nothing really happens except that we will no longer be asleep, and will know ourselves in our true identity as God's one Son. This is what is referred to when the Course says: \"Healing does not come directly from God, Who knows His creations as perfectly whole. Yet healing is still of God, because it proceeds from His Voice and from His laws\" (T-7.IV.1:4-5). What proceeds from His Voice and from His laws is the truth of who we are. It is healing in the sense that the mind will no longer be made sick or insane by the thought of separation."

If God is just, why would he make an innocent man die in order to forgive me? Why couldn't he just forgive us in the first place? What does A Course in Miracles say about this?",
    "output": "The Course reinterprets the crucifixion, as well as the idea of sin and forgiveness. You were taught the meaning of the crucifixion that Christianity holds sacred, as were all Christians. It is the story of redemption according to Christianity. The message the Course teaches is not based on the forgiveness of sin, to the contrary: \"...the content of the course never changes. Its central theme is always, 'God's Son is guiltless, and in his innocence is his salvation.'\" (M-1.3:4-5). There is no need for forgiveness from God, much less for redemption through crucifixion. Forgiveness, as taught by the Course, is a process of undoing the belief in separation. It is the means by which we learn to no longer identify with the ego, which eventually leads to our awakening from the dream of separation. It has nothing to do with sin, because as the Course tells us, there is no sin: \"God's Will for you is perfect happiness because there is no sin, and suffering is causeless\" (W-pI.101.6:1). Since the thought of separation is an illusion, and God knows only our wholeness as His one Son, He would not \"make an innocent man die in order to forgive\" anyone. He would be a cruel God indeed if He required the death of His Son to appease His anger. The Course tells us that not only does God not require crucifixion or sacrifice, He does not even judge His Son: \"God does not judge His guiltless Son. Having given Himself to him, how could it be otherwise?\" (T- 11.VI.7:6-7). Clearly it is not possible to follow the thought systems of both Christianity and A Course in Miracles, for they are not compatible, nor comparable teachings. It may be helpful for you to read the sections \"The Message of the Crucifixion\" (T-6.I) and \"Atonement without Sacrifice\" (T-3.I) for the Course's teaching on the crucifixion and innocence."

    "text_input": "Q #221: As I understand it, all things of form in this world, both animate and inanimate, are part of the Sonship, and all parts of the Sonship need to be in the real world for the Second Coming to occur. I know there really is only one mind, but within the illusion of separation there seems to be many split minds. Also, since I need only be concerned with the healing of my own mind, there seems to be a direct relationship between my body and my mind. Does each thing of form in this world of separation have a mind that needs to be healed? How can this be? I know some form of this question has been asked before, but I still don't get it.",
    "output": "Yes, A Course in Miracles teaches that there really is only one mind, but we have the illusion of there being many split minds. The Second Coming is the collective return to awareness of our reality as the one Son of God; it is the complete healing of the mind of the Sonship. This is extremely difficult to understand. In fact, it is impossible to understand if you are identified with your individual existence as a human being, because that identity was set up by the ego to block all understanding of the mind that is outside time and space, and which contains the key to understanding the origin of our existence as separated, fragmented beings. Very little in the Course will make sense if you try to relate it to your experience in the world. We all try to do that, of course, because that is our only reference point for understanding anything. That is why Jesus starts us out on that level, but if we stay on that level, where we still think of ourselves as physical/psychological beings in the world, we will not get very far with the Course. Once again, that is because we always try to understand it from a perspective within time and space, and Jesus is teaching us that that perspective was made to block us from getting back to our minds. It was made to proliferate problems and mysteries that would grab our attention and then occupy our attention completely, so that we would never realize it is all a defense against the truth. Jesus is outside this limited perspective entirely, and he is training us--through the exercises in the workbook--to gradually let go of our way of perceiving, and replace it with his. As we get further along the path of this thought-reversal, these types of questions will disappear, because we will identify less and less with our separated existence, and therefore we will have first-hand experiences of a shared identity. We will be more attracted to oneness than to division and separation."

    "text_input": "Q #222: For some time now I have been studying the \"human relations\" techniques as taught by Dale Carnegie in his best selling books and famous seminar. Carnegie teaches that I should always talk in terms of others' interests, that I should never tell others they're wrong (but should call attention to their mistakes indirectly), and that the only way to win an argument is not to have one. I had avoided using these techniques until quite recently because I had considered them to be quite manipulative. In the language of A Course in Miracles, I believed it could even be stated that such techniques are attempts to murder other people because they are attempts to control others and get from them what I want. But over the last few weeks I have been using these techniques consistently, and I have been stunned at how well they have worked!  It recently occurred to me that Carnegie's human relations techniques ultimately reveal the investment most of us have in maintaining our specialness and our separateness. In fact, such techniques seem to be geared toward helping others reinforce their own specialness and separateness as well. But there have also been times I realize when I could not have dealt in a civil manner with some people without using the Carnegie techniques. For some people (myself among them, I'm sure), the idea that they are not special or separate is a fearful idea. Could it be that in some cases the Carnegie techniques could actually be a form of forgiveness, just as taking medication for an illness is a form of forgiveness?",
    "output": "What you are recognizing is a fundamental teaching of the Course: that purpose is everything (T-4.V.6:8-11; T-24.VII.6:1-3). One of the most significant contributions of the Course to the world's spiritualities is that, rather than advocating denial and rejection of the ways of the world, it teaches that we can use what the ego has made for separation and attack to serve a different purpose--forgiveness. The key is to be willing to allow the specific forms to serve the Holy Spirit's purpose rather than our own (T-6.V-A.2:4-5). You have recognized that tools of manipulation and murder in the hands of the ego can become the means for seeing both your brother and yourself in a different light. But first, you must have made a decision to see both of you differently--as having shared rather than separate interests. Your intent has shifted from having your own needs met through controlling your brother to recognizing at some level that you both have the same need to be forgiven, to be seen in the light of true charity. So now, what was made to reinforce separation and specialness becomes a means for undoing them. As always, the value lies not in the specific technique or form, but in the purpose you are giving it. The issue of purpose is addressed further in #57."

    "text_input": "Q #223: I would like an understanding of \"Entering the Ark\" (T-20.IV). This section seems to indicate that we have one special person with whom we work out our salvation, whereas my understanding is that every seemingly separate individual out there is our brother and so we must see the face of Christ in every living thing. I am in a marriage where my wife does not study A Course in Miracles and, in my perception, is afraid of what it is teaching us. I have also encountered a Course teaching institution that tells us we must have one special buddy with whom we can really study and work out our salvation. Can you resolve this confusion for me?",
    "output": "You seem to be raising two related questions: the first is whether there is only one relationship or many in which we must practice forgiveness; the second is whether we can really practice the Course and learn our forgiveness lessons if our learning partner is not a student of the Course. For the first, you are no doubt referring in particular to the sentence in \"The Ark of Peace\" that says, \"To each who walks this earth in seeming solitude is a savior given, whose special function here is to release him, and so to free himself\" (T-20.IV.5:3). Jesus then adds, \"In the world of separation each is appointed separately, though they are all the same\" (T-20.IV.5:4). You are correct, as this second sentence suggests, in observing that forgiveness must come to rest upon every seemingly separate brother until we see them as all the same. But it is also usually the case that, at any point in time, there is one particular person with whom we are struggling, who provides our most challenging lessons in forgiveness. Who this other is may or may not change over time. But even though the faces may change, the underlying lessons will remain the same, until we are willing to look at and then release the guilt that we have projected on to them because we have not wanted to acknowledge it is in our own minds. So every relationship provides opportunities to practice forgiveness, but those that seem to push more of our buttons are the greater symbols of our own buried guilt and so provide the maximal opportunities for learning our lessons. Jesus speaks in the manual of these different levels of learning opportunities in the context of teacher-student relationships (M-3). As for your second question, a careful reading of the section you refer to should make it clear that Jesus is only talking about how we perceive our learning partner and not about what specifically happens at the level of behavior or form between the two of us. It is our ego that wants to bring the focus to what we do with our partner at the level of bodies. According to the Course, relationships exist only in the mind and not between bodies in the world (T-28.IV.3). And so my healing in any relationship is completely unrelated to how you as my learning partner may or may not participate in the study and application of Course principles. If I were dependent on your involvement in any way HYPERLINK \"http://facimoutreach.org/qa/questions/questions20.htm#Q92\", I would be at the mercy of your choices, and not simply dependent on my own internal decision about how to perceive you. Now in some cases, it may be helpful if a partner is also studying the Course and there are opportunities for sharing and discussing on the level of form. But this can in no way be necessary for my salvation or Jesus would be selling us the same bill of goods that the ego has been trying to pass off on us from the beginning--victimization of myself by another would be alive and well and inescapable. Furthermore, whether you as my learning partner are in your right mind or your wrong mind in any of our interactions, if the Holy Spirit is my Guide for how I perceive you, my response will always be the same. For, accepting the Holy Spirit's judgment rather than my own, I will know that you are only either extending love or giving a call for love, and my response is always the same--I allow myself to be an instrument of the Holy Spirit's Love (T-12.I). My resistance to accepting the Holy Spirit's perception of you in any aspects of our relationship simply points to those areas where my forgiveness lessons remain unlearned. And that is how you, as my learning partner, are really my savior, for you direct me to the unhealed thoughts of darkness in my mind, so that now I can make a different choice about how to see myself."

    "text_input": "Q #224: Does the concept that this world was over and done in the same moment mean that everything in this world is predestined, that we have no power to make happen what we want?",
    "output": "From a traditional viewpoint of predestination, according to A Course in Miracles, what happens in the world is not predestined. The scripts of our lives have been authored by the \"decision maker,\" not by God, and they do not follow a temporal sequence, upon which predestination is based. A quick reminder: the decision maker is that aspect of the split mind which chooses either the ego or the Holy Spirit as its teacher. While we experience ourselves in time, and review mentally the scripts that have already gone by (W-pI.158.4), we do have the capacity to choose--at any given instant--which teacher will guide us through our daily lives. And remember that this \"we\" is not the self we call ourselves by name, but rather the decision maker in our mind, which is outside of time and space. If you want to \"stretch\" the definition of predestination, you could say that there is one of the Course teachings which would fall under this category, as stated here: \"The acceptance of the Atonement by everyone is only a matter of time. This may appear to contradict free will because of the inevitability of the final decision, but this is not so. You can temporize and you are capable of enormous procrastination...but the outcome is as certain as God\" (T-2.III.3:1-3,10). And finally, while it may not seem this way, we all have the power to make happen what we want: \"Besides your recognizing that thoughts are never idle, salvation requires that you also recognize that every thought you have brings either peace or war; either love or fear\" (W- pI.16.3:1). Take a good look at you life, and realize that whatever the circumstances--now, in the past, and to come--are a result of getting what one wants. This is hard to come to grips with since most of us, at least at one point or another, have experienced painful lives. And yet this is exactly what the ego wants. And we, being identified with the ego, are getting exactly what we want. The good news is that once we totally shift our allegiance from the ego to the Holy Spirit, we will get happiness and peace, which is secretly what we have wanted all along."

    "text_input": "Q #225: I am reading A Course in Miracles for the second time and I am having trouble with Lesson 135. Does it mean that if someone physically attacks you or verbally attacks you, you should just do nothing? Should you allow someone to physically \"beat you up\"? I don't think this is what it means. I just want to make sure I am interpreting this correctly. Does the practice of martial arts conflict with the Course's teachings?",
    "output": "You are correct with regard to Lesson 135 \"If I defend myself I am attacked.\" It does not mean that you should allow yourself to be beaten up or abused, or to watch someone else being abused without intervening. This is one of the most misunderstood and misapplied concepts in the entire Course. It is important to remember that the Course is never talking about behavior, and that the practice of the Course should never exclude common sense. The Course is always focusing on the content in our minds. Thus, you can be in your right mind and forcibly stop another person from hitting you, or you can be in your wrong mind and do that. You can be in your right mind and do nothing, or you can be in your wrong mind and do nothing. If we can get past our ego for an instant, then anything we do or do not do would be \"right.\" Throughout the Course, Jesus is always teaching us that our thinking flows from either the ego's thought system or the Holy Spirit's, whichever we have chosen. Thus in this lesson he is specifically teaching us that whenever we perceive ourselves attacked and we feel a need to defend ourselves, we have reinforced a self-concept of fear and vulnerability, which means we see ourselves as a body, not as God created us. Only if we are afraid would we have need of defenses. That is helpful information, for it lets us know which thought system we are identified with. But we cannot correct our faulty self-concept simply by allowing ourselves to be abused or violated in some way. That would not advance us spiritually, just as removing all locks from our doors and canceling insurance policies would not advance us spiritually. As long as we experience ourselves as bodies, then we need to respond to and respect our bodily needs, both physical and psychological. Jesus is speaking to us from his perspective as a healed mind, which knows with certainty that bodies and this world are totally illusory. He is simply saying that we, whose minds are not healed, should pay careful attention to the thought system we have chosen to identify with, and then ask his help to look through his eyes to see what this world is really like, and what its purpose is. Then we would have a basis for choosing differently. He is helping us realize that there is an inherent fear in everyone, and that it is coming from our minds, not from hostile elements in the world or the body, which are all part of the ego's strategy to keep us mindless. A defense against the fear and guilt in our HYPERLINK \"http://facimoutreach.org/qa/questions/questions35.htm#Q179\"  HYPERLINK \"http://facimoutreach.org/qa/questions/questions35.htm#Q179\"minds HYPERLINK \"http://facimoutreach.org/qa/questions/questions35.htm#Q179\"  HYPERLINK \"http://facimoutreach.org/qa/questions/questions35.htm#Q179\"is HYPERLINK \"http://facimoutreach.org/qa/questions/questions35.htm#Q179\"  HYPERLINK \"http://facimoutreach.org/qa/questions/questions35.htm#Q179\"not HYPERLINK \"http://facimoutreach.org/qa/questions/questions35.htm#Q179\"  HYPERLINK \"http://facimoutreach.org/qa/questions/questions35.htm#Q179\"ne HYPERLINK \"http://facimoutreach.org/qa/questions/questions40.htm#Q202\"cessary, because they are made up by the ego. We need only ask his help to correct our mistaken choice to identify with the ego thought system of sin, guilt, and fear. And we know that we have made that mistaken choice every time we experience ourselves as vulnerable and attacked. Again, that does not mean that we do not protect ourselves in whatever way is appropriate in the world, including the use of martial arts. Finally, Jesus does not mean in this lesson that we should never make plans; he means only that we should consult with him first, because as unhealed minds we have no idea of what is in our best interests, or in anyone else's best interests. We must even be vigilant about presuming to know what our problems are, lest we fall into the ego trap of telling Jesus or the Holy Spirit how They should solve our problems. Our energies and efforts would be much better placed in asking for help to forgive, for that alone will remove the barriers to our truly hearing the Voice for Love, Whose wisdom would gently guide us in all our words and actions. Guilt is the problem, forgiveness is the answer. We need never get more specific than that."

    "text_input": "Q #226: If our lives are determined by a decision made outside of time and space, i.e., a choice about which teacher to listen to, then what is the sense of trying, with our personality self, to change anything? Why even do the workbook as that is done with the small self? I guess I am asking what role does the self I believe I am play, in the big scheme of things?",
    "output": "Hey, it's not as hopeless as all that! But the first thing you want to understand, even though it is not your experience, is that nothing is attempted or done by the self in the world that we think we are--it's nothing but a shadow of thoughts in the mind. Everything HYPERLINK \"http://facimoutreach.org/qa/questions/questions9.htm#Q37\"  HYPERLINK \"http://facimoutreach.org/qa/questions/questions9.htm#Q37\"is done by HYPERLINK \"http://facimoutreach.org/qa/questions/questions9.htm#Q37\"  HYPERLINK \"http://facimoutreach.org/qa/questions/questions9.htm#Q37\"the mind--all power rests there. It's just that we have deceived ourselves about who we are and so think that we are the shadow rather than the light without which there could be no shadow. So everything we find ourselves doing in the world is a shadow or projection of a choice we have made in our mind, often unconsciously, as to which teacher to listen to. And for a long time, since we don't know there is any teacher but the ego, even our choice for the ego is forgotten. And that, of course, has been the ego's goal, for we now seem to be mindless. We believe we do our thinking with the brain--a masterful deception (W-pI.92.2)--and are no longer aware that we have a mind, even though awareness is only of the mind. And if we don't know we have a mind, it's going to be a lot more difficult to change it, which of course is also the ego's goal. Consider the example you give of doing the workbook lessons. They are not really done by the self I think I am--my experience of reading and practicing them in the world is a reflection of a choice I have made in my mind, which has then been projected out as behavior performed by my illusory self in the world. All learning takes place in the mind. But while we are still too fearful to see ourselves as mind, we will continue to experience everything as being chosen and carried out by the self we think we are in the world. What is helpful about our seeming experience in the world is that it can be used as a barometer to help us recognize which teacher we have in fact turned to in our mind. The choice to do the workbook lessons, made in the mind, is in most cases a decision to turn away from the ego and to turn toward the Holy Spirit. So learning is going on--it's just that it's not my self here that is learning--that self is only ever an effect and never a cause of anything. But again, while our reality as mind is too fearful to accept, we will experience the learning as if it were happening on this plane by the little self we think we are. So by all means continue to do the workbook lessons. And practice forgiveness in the classrooms of your seeming life here. These are the opportunities Jesus is asking us to give to him so he can help us change our minds while we still think we are bodies, until such time as guilt no longer has a hold on our minds and we no longer need the body and the personality self as a defense against the guilt."

    "text_input": "Q #227: A Course in Miracles mentions the existence of a specific brother. Should that be interpreted as the partner in the current relationship that the reader is involved in? It seems to me that the Course clearly states that happiness is linked to the development of this relationship. Is that correct?",
    "output": "Jesus was \"speaking\" to Helen Schucman and Bill Thetford about their relationship and other relationships in their lives, and so the teaching and discussion is expressed in that context. Jesus was trying to help Helen realize how much happier and more peaceful she would be if she let go of her judgments of Bill and other specific people in her life. But when practicing, we can use anyone at all, whether living or not, currently in our lives or not. It is not always the case that the relationship you are currently involved in is the one you need to work on most, although it could be. There might also be some powerful unresolved issues with a child, a dead parent, a sibling, or some other relative, a friend, or even a public figure. Usually someone comes quickly to mind when we are doing the exercises in the workbook or applying what we are reading about in the text. It does not really matter, though, because this is all about the content in our own minds, and all relationships are in the mind. The content is always the same, regardless of the form of the relationship. All of our relationship problems stem from our projected self-hatred, guilt, and agonizing sense of lack. If we were to heal any one relationship totally, we would have healed them all, and we would be completely happy, because, once again, the content is always the same, time is not real, and all minds are joined."

    "text_input": "Q #228: In A Course in Miracles, Jesus says that: 1) We are all part of a single formless being which has been created by another formless being; 2) Time concepts are illusory. Isn't before a time concept? How is it possible for a being to create another being and not come before it?",
    "output": "It is helpful to realize that whenever Jesus in the Course attempts to convey anything about creation and our true reality in God, he must use words and concepts that will have to fail in the end to do anything more than suggest a state that we cannot comprehend. For it is not possible to describe what is beyond description, and what is unlimited and infinite can not be defined in finite terms. Jesus must use the language of perception to talk about what is beyond perception, beyond time and space. But the Course also has a purpose in attempting to explain the unexplainable. And that is to provide a correction for the mistaken concepts and beliefs of the ego thought system. Grounded in a perceptual duality, these concepts and beliefs assert, albeit now unconsciously, that we have separated from God, usurped His power to create, and in fact are the creator and source of all existence (T-11.in.1:6-8; 2). And so the correction Jesus offers also uses dualistic words, such as Father and Son, which imply both spatial and temporal dimensions to the relationship. But these words are used only to undo our belief that we can be the cause of ourselves, returning to God the role of Source of all being. That Jesus does not mean these explanations literally becomes apparent when we read passages which attempt to provide insight into the true nature of God and reality, a reality beyond time and space, in which there are not two separate beings called God and Christ. So, for example, Jesus observes, while still using the dualistic language of the ego thought system, that \"God...makes no distinctions in what is Himself and what is still Himself. What He creates is not apart from Him, and nowhere does the Father end, the Son begin as something separate from Him\" (W-pI.132.12:3-4). And time-based concepts, such as before and after, or first and last, simply do not apply to God in the usual sense. God \"does nothing last, because He created first and for always. It must be understood that the word 'first' as applied to Him is not a time concept. He is first in the sense that He is the First in the Holy Trinity Itself. He is the Prime Creator, because He created His co-creators. Because He did, time applies neither to Him nor to what He created\" (T-7.I.7:3-7; italics added). If you are not satisfied with what must be a dissatisfying account for what can not be understood by us, take comfort in the fact that you are not alone. In attempting to describe the nature and condition of true creation, Jesus concludes, \"To no one here is this describable. Nor is there any way to learn what this condition means. Not till you go past learning to the Given ... is it understood\" (T-24.VII.6:8-10). And so, we simply can accept with humility that we do not understand. But the good news is that, despite our belief that we need to understand, we don't have to understand in order to find our way back home (T-18.IV.7:5-7). We can practice our lessons of forgiveness, confident that if we do our part, the rest will be ours when we are ready to accept it. For additional discussion of the dualistic nature of the Course language in relationship to its non- dualistic metaphysics, see #85."

I have had hypothyroidism for the past 24 years or so and have also been diagnosed with depression. I do believe in the absolute faith in God and His truth. Do I stop taking my medications? I realize that I have an underlying fear of the consequences of untreated hypothyroidism. Can my faith remove these conditions? Is the healing referred to here physical, spiritual, or otherwise. I feel very lost about this.",
    "output": "Please do not stop taking your medications. That is not the goal of this workbook lesson. Jesus would never ask us to give up anything in the world of form that still seems to help us feel better, that controls our bodily symptoms and reduces our pain and fear (T-2.IV.4:5-10; 5). He is only trying to get us to look beyond our tacit assumptions about sickness and cures. Specifically, the purpose of this lesson is to help us begin to understand that it is not the body that is sick or that should be our focus for healing. Rather it is the mind that believes that separation and guilt are real. That is the idea behind the lines: \"Atonement does not heal the sick, for that is not a cure. It takes away the guilt that makes the sickness possible. And that is cure indeed\" (W-pI.140.4:4-6). And later in the lesson, \"Let us not try today to seek to cure what cannot suffer sickness [the body]. Healing must be sought but where it is [in the mind], and then applied to what is sick [the mind], so that it [the mind] can be cured\" (W-pI.140.7:1-2). This idea is asserted with great clarity in the text: \"The body needs no healing. But the mind that thinks it is a body is sick indeed!\" (T-25.in.3:1-2). This lesson is not attempting to bring about any change in our behavior, such as having us stop our medications. Rather, we are being invited to open up to a different way of thinking about what is sick and why. And once we begin to accept that illness is in the mind and comes from our unconscious but illusory belief in guilt--guilt over thinking we have separated ourselves from and attacked our Source--we can then begin to understand that healing simply involves a process of undoing these beliefs--what the Course refers to as forgiveness. So keep taking your medications, but at the same time, invite Jesus in to look with you at the guilt in your mind that has led you to believe not only that you are a body, but that you deserve to suffer. Jesus accepts neither of those beliefs about you, but you still do, and so you need his guidance. As a point of clarification, the Course's meaning of faith is different from traditional uses, such as in faith healing. God does not heal our sickness--the Course is not asking us to place our faith in Him to take away all our illness and pain. By faith, the Course is referring to the allegiance we give to either the ego or the Holy Spirit to guide our thinking, with the inevitable outcomes that follow putting our faith in each teacher (T-13.IX.2:3-6). Place your faith in the ego's interpretation of yourself and others and you are guaranteeing yourself guilt, fear, pain, illness and death. Place your faith in the Holy Spirit's interpretation and you are guaranteeing yourself peace, love, joy and life. And to place your faith in the Holy Spirit means that you are willing to replace judgment and attack upon yourself and others with the healing balm of forgiveness. For related discussions on healing and illness, see also Questions #57, #128 and #142."

I wonder if others have asked this question before, but have not been answered yet?",
    "output": "It is not necessary to begin the workbook again. You can always go back and do a lesson again or concentrate on a specific concept that you skipped over; but that does not mean that you should start all over again. Jesus does not expect us to do a lesson perfectly before we move on to the next one. He is far more aware of our resistance and fear than we are, so he knows we will misinterpret what he says, not do everything he asks, and when we do it, we will do it imperfectly. He is interested only in our willingness and humility as we practice the lessons. The middle of Lesson 95, in particular, discusses the attitude we should have when we run into problems in our work with the lessons.

    "text_input": "Q #231: My question pertains to the world we see as an illusion. Is it safe to say that if we find \"enjoyment\" here we must keep in mind it is still only an illusion, otherwise we become attached to it in a negative way? Does this sort of parallel what the scriptures say that we are not of this world but only in this world? This makes for a tug of war within us because when we seem to desire something, we ask: which part is doing the desiring? At that point, can we justify the desire by keeping in mind that it really does not matter because it is only illusion and then go on and enjoy? Is justify the wrong word? Are we on the right track with this reasoning?",
    "output": "Your reasoning is partially correct. Anything we desire in the world of form is only an illusion, but we should not dismiss our seeking or desiring it too quickly. Although A Course in Miracles does not ask that we relinquish enjoyment in the dream, it does ask that we recognize the real motives for our pursuit of pleasurable experiences. It tells us that we are seeking to fill the void left by our seeming separation from God with substitutes for His Love that never fully satisfy us. This is at the root of all our seeking in the dream. The Course uncovers our motives in the hopes that we will learn not to seek outside ourselves for what will never truly bring us happiness. As long as we make the mistake of believing that the cause of our \"enjoyment\" is something or someone external to ourselves, we will seek in vain, in keeping with the ego's maxim: \"Seek but do not find\" (M-13.5:8). The Course tells us that the only enjoyment possible in the dream is a peaceful state of mind, and that is achieved only by the choice to join with the Holy Spirit in the mind, and accept His interpretation of every experience or relationship we have. That is not to say that we cannot enjoy a pleasurable experience in the world. The point is that if our mind is at peace, it does not matter whether we are enjoying a beautiful concert or are stuck in hot traffic--our peacefulness remains undisturbed. This is not the same as indulging our desires for pleasure by saying it is all an illusion and it doesn't matter. If we were at the point in our spiritual journey where we truly believed that this is all an illusion, we would not need A Course in Miracles to help us see how real we think the world is, and, we would not be in pursuit of enjoyment in the world. Meanwhile, all the things in the world we do seek are important reminders of how attached we are to our identity as bodies and the ego thought system, which makes separation and the world very real. Both negative emotions (pain) as well as positive emotions (enjoyment) which are evoked by our experiences are our \"proof\" that the world is real. We are learning to be aware of how desperately we seek this. The only part of our mind that desires anything, no matter how lofty it may seem to be, is the ego \"Appetites are 'getting' mechanisms, representing the ego's need to confirm itself. This is as true of body appetites as it is of the so-called 'higher ego needs.' Body appetites are not physical in origin. The ego regards the body as its home, and tries to satisfy itself through the body. But the idea that this is possible is a decision of the mind, which has become completely confused about what is really possible\" (T-4.II.7:5-9). The Course is a mind training process because we are so confused, have taught ourselves upside down thinking, and do not know what makes us happy: \"You no more recognize what is painful than you know what is joyful, and are, in fact, very apt to confuse the two. The Holy Spirit's main function is to teach you to tell them apart. What is joyful to you is painful to the ego, and as long as you are in doubt about what you are, you will be confused about joy and pain\" (T-7.X.3:4-6). This does not mean we should feel guilty for seeking enjoyment. It is no different than any of the other things we do to take care of ourselves in the illusion. While we still believe in our identity as bodies, we will find \"enjoyment\" in the world. Though the ego uses this to support the belief that the separation is real, the Holy Spirit can use it as part of His classroom to teach us that there is no satisfaction in this world, and that our only true happiness is found in God. We may also have experiences that are truly joyful because they reflect a choice in the mind to identify with the Holy Spirit. As we continue to practice what the Course teaches, we will eventually have truly joyful experiences that reflect the choice made in the mind to identify with the Holy Spirit. This joy comes from the content in the mind rather than anything in form."

    "text_input": "Q #232: The ego thought system teaches us that being a mother or a father is something noble. In other words, having children is \"good.\" But as far as I understand, A Course in Miracles has something else to say about this. Is this just another illusion? Maybe something \"wrong,\" because it makes us believe in this world and reinforces our bonds to this reality?",
    "output": "Jesus does not say that there is something \"wrong\" in being a parent; nor does he say it is something noble. Any role in this world is part of the ego's plan to make its world the only reality. So in that sense, parenting is part of the whole illusion that there is life outside Heaven. Any role in this world is a substitute for our true role as God's one Son, Christ. Parenting in particular, though, may have more guilt associated with it--even though there really are no degrees of guilt--because of its connection with producing \"life,\" i.e., bringing babies into the world. Within the ego thought system, this is a way of competing with God, a way of saying that we are just as powerful as He is, and therefore that He no longer is needed. The ego now can produce life, and end it. Many religions bless this process by describing it as co-creation, i.e., human parents are the co-creators, with God, of life. In A Course in Miracles, however, life is the pure abstract oneness of Love in Heaven. All bodily life and parenting is therefore illusory. Given the Holy Spirit's purpose, though, the role of parent can become a classroom in which a person can learn how to be a loving, kind, compassionate authority figure while carrying out the responsibilities of a parent appropriately and conscientiously. The lesson of shared interests can be very effectively learned, while the parent keeps the boundaries between parent and child clearly defined. (Questions #179 and #202 might be of interest to you.)"

    "text_input": "Q #233: In answering #79, you quoted a statement that I would like you to elaborate on and explain: \"Everyone makes an ego or a self for himself, which is subject to enormous variation because of its instability. He also makes an ego for everyone else he perceives, which is equally variable.\" Does this mean that I am responsible not only for my own thoughts and actions, but also for the things you do to me, and that I choose the manner in which you play them out? Is this included in the script I write--exactly, in detail, how you will treat me?",
    "output": "To make sense of this passage, we need to be clear that Jesus is speaking to the dreamer of the dream and not to the figure in the dream that we mistakenly identify as ourselves (T-27.VII; VIII). At the metaphysical level, we have assigned all the roles and actions to all the figures in our life--our waking dreams--just as we have done in our sleeping dreams at night. But most of us are not in touch with this initial level of decision-making. These are all the possible ego scripts, written by the single, collective mind before the fragmentation into billions of separate, individual minds seemed to occur. At the next level of seemingly fragmented, independent minds, we reach agreements with other minds about how we will play out our respective dream roles, that is, which scripts we will review. And, while we choose from the ego-based scripts, these are always some variation on the theme of victim and victimizer. We select the events of our life in conjunction with other minds, but again we have no conscious memory of making the choices, an essential repression for our victim defense to work (for a further discussion of this, see #37). The above passage, however, can also be considered from a more immediate psychological level, which is relatively easy to become conscious of and so more practical to work with. We simply recognize our propensity to attribute ego motivations to others, based on our interpretations of our own ego needs. Your purpose may or may not be to manipulate me in any given situation, but I will ascribe ego intent to your actions and act as if my interpretation is valid. Jesus makes it very clear that this kind of analysis is hazardous to our own peace of mind (T-12.I.1-2). And he also gently reminds us of the unreliability of our observations of others: \"Remember how many times you thought you knew all the 'facts' you needed for judgment, and how wrong you were! Is there anyone who has not had this experience? Would you know how many times you merely thought you were right, without ever realizing you were wrong?\" (M- 10.4:1-3). Yet we continue making \"an ego for everyone else\" as a way of seeing the guilt of the ego thought system outside of ourselves rather than accepting responsibility for its existence within our own mind. So Jesus' purpose is to lead us to recognize not only what a barrier our projections are to our own happiness but \"the tremendous release and deep peace that comes from meeting yourself and your brothers totally without judgment\" (T-3.VI.3:1)."

    "text_input": "Q #234: Since everything in this world of form is the fragmented Son of God, and the Son's purpose is forgiveness and accepting the Atonement for one's self, how would anything non- human (A Course in Miracles is written specifically for humans) work on that? How does a mountain, a chair, a book, a machine, a tree, an amoeba, a grain of sand, a hurricane, etc., learn a spirituality? Does my choosing to appear as a human with the ability to learn mean I am choosing to have the ability to wake up now rather than later? Since every Son of God in the Sonship has to wake up before oneness is achieved, won't we be waiting an infinity for the inanimate things and the lower creatures on the \"evolutionary scale\" to perceive all this or is it even possible?",
    "output": "It would be very difficult, if not impossible, for us to understand how non-human entities can learn a spirituality. But there must be one, because the Sonship will return to its natural state as spirit, as one Son. We are at a distinct disadvantage, though, because our reference point is always our own \"human\" experience in which we see ourselves at the top, or close to it, on the \"evolutionary scale.\" This reference point is purposefully established--by the ego--so that \"reality\" can be viewed hierarchically--\"the great chain of being,\" as it is commonly labeled. Thus we try to understand everything from this ego perspective, which is designed to conceal the true nature of reality. We are falling right into the ego's trap, in other words, when we situate the Course's teachings in the human framework. Surely, there is no other framework or context in which we can work; but it is essential that we realize that it is an ego setup to keep us from ever getting back into our minds beyond our spatial-temporal experience. That is what Jesus is helping us to do, so that we may share his vision of everything. Getting bogged down with questions such as these, which are good ones, would further the ego's purpose of validating our existence. If we practice forgiveness day in and day out, we will be shedding our limited view and moving closer to where Jesus is. Our interests then would shift as well, and more than likely, we would not be preoccupied with these issues, intriguing as they are."

    "text_input": "Q #235: #116 asks whether God intervenes in this world of form for us. Your answer was beautifully stated but was left wanting in my opinion. By its very title, A Course in Miracles, Jesus is telling us that He will indeed intervene in this mad dream we're having. There is no problem that cannot be answered by a miracle, whether it be in finances, health or emotional turmoil, or anything in between. That is the whole reason Jesus took the time to come to us in this form. All the work we do to undo our ego identification results in the undoing of all our problems. Every problem is answered. Our Light shines away all the darkness. So to put this in a question form: why is not more emphasis put on the realization of one's happiness by following the Course?",
    "output": "Why not more emphasis on finding happiness through the Course, you ask? Because none of us wants the happiness that the Course offers us. We all want our definition of happiness, which means having our personal needs met, whether they be financial, health, emotional or whatever. But that is not what the Course offers. It is inviting us through the practice of forgiveness to let go of all our judgments and grievances until, at the end of the process, we also release our identification with this personal self that we believe has all these problems and needs. The happiness the Course holds out to us comes from awakening from the dream of pain which we call our lives here in the world, a dream in which there is no hope of real happiness. But we don't want that. And so Jesus says he must first teach us the difference between joy and pain, between freedom and imprisonment (T-7.X; T-8.II.4-5). Otherwise we will continue to seek pain, believing it is joy, and strive to maintain our imprisonment, insisting it is freedom. We need a lot of help, but not with the \"problems\" of the world. To answer your unstated question--neither God nor Jesus intervenes in the world. Nor do they intervene in our minds. To intervene and fix problems at any level would be to make the error of separation real (T-26.VII.12). And the correction, which the Course calls the Atonement principle, says the separation never in reality happened. So it would make no sense for God or Jesus to intervene in our insane world. We made up all of our worldly problems so that we could cover over and not have to look at what we believe is the real problem--the guilt in our mind over separating from God. The only help we need is with changing our minds about that guilt and, although we can't do this on our own, Jesus tells us he can't change our minds for us. He can only show us what we have made real and its consequences, in the world and in our minds, in the hope that we will recognize our insanity and be willing to make the same choice he has already made (T-2.VI.4; T-2.VII.1; T-3.IV.7; T-5.II.9:1-11:1; T-8.IV.4-6). The thing is, none of us really minds being unhappy, so long as we don't think we're responsible for that unhappiness. We want a world and relationships with problems that victimize us so that we don't have to see that our choice for separation and individuality is the real cause of all our pain. And until we can recognize and accept that fact, we will have no interest in the happiness that following the Course offers us. We will find real happiness by following Jesus' teaching, but not because all of our problems in the world will be resolved as a result of his intercession. We have no problems in the world that need resolving. Yes, all the darkness will disappear in the light of who we are--and that includes not only all of our problems in the world, but the world itself and the self we think we are within the world, as well as the guilt within our mind that is the source of all of our projections into a world of form. Because for most of us, that thought is fearful, Jesus assures us in many places in his Course that the path is a process and we will progress along it at our pace, as we are comfortable (e.g., T-16.VI.8:1-3). But at least now we can understand our resistance to practicing his teachings of forgiveness. As Jesus reminds us, \"Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all of the barriers within yourself that you have built against it. It is not necessary to seek for what is true, but it is necessary to seek for what is false\" (T-16.IV.6:1-2). For further discussion of why God does not intervene in the world, see #42."

    "text_input": "Q #236: One of the things I find hardest to accept about A Course in Miracles is its apparent dismissal of humanity's \"higher strivings,\" as embodied, especially, in art and science. Clearly what the Course understands by our \"creations\" is something entirely different from \"creativity\" in the artistic or scientific sense. The latter, it would seem, generates nothing more than illusion within illusion (shades of Plato?), rather than pointing Man to a higher and more beautiful reality. Does this mean that artists and scientists should pack it in, and the rest of us dismiss their efforts as part of the big ego-distraction?",
    "output": "You raise an important question, one that has troubled many students and observers of A Course in Miracles. On the one hand, it is indeed possible to concentrate on learning and practicing forgiveness while setting aside for a while this dimension of the Course's theory. On the other hand, this issue cannot be ignored if one is to attain a comprehensive understanding of what the Course is saying about our world and ourselves. Examining this issue in the light of the two levels on which this Course is written, along with the distinction between form and content might help with your concern. Although it is true that artistic and scientific \"creativity\" \"generates nothing more than illusion within illusion,\" this does not mean that \"artists and scientists should pack it in, and the rest of us dismiss their efforts as part of the big ego-distraction\"--any more than the fact that the body is part of the ego's plan to attack God means that surgeons, chiropractors, dentists, physical therapists, etc., should \"pack it in.\" The Course would indeed not be the practical, gentle, and kind course that it is if this were what it advocated. First, throughout the Course, Jesus is trying to help us see things from his point of view, to step outside the entire world to view its origin in the thought system we maintain in our minds, and to see what we have given up in exchange for our individual, separate existence, so that we may have a better basis for understanding and evaluating what we have. He appeals to us in many ways to recognize that even the best of what we have in this world is unimaginably minuscule when compared to the glory that we rejected in our choice to prefer separation over oneness. Jesus consistently teaches us that nothing in this world, or of this world, is of God, and therefore it has no reality. On this level of absolute truth, which we call Level One, all human activity is futile and meaningless. The only genuine creativity is in Heaven, in the extension of infinite Love: \"True giving is creation. It extends the limitless to the unlimited, eternity to timelessness, and love unto itself. It adds to all that is complete already ... by letting what cannot contain itself fulfill its aim of giving everything it has away, thus securing it forever for itself\" (W-pI.105.4:2- 5). Moving from Level One of the Course to Level Two--which is the level of teaching in which Jesus communicates in a framework that is meaningful to us, and which he can use to start us back up the ladder our choice to be separate led us down (T-28.III.1:2)--he tells us that we have a split mind, and that when we left Heaven (an impossibility of course), we took with us the memory of all we left behind, but buried it far beyond awareness. Since it is still there in our split minds, however, it can be evoked. Practicing A Course in Miracles is one way of bringing this memory back into awareness. In fact, anything at all may be utilized toward this end, including the work of artists and scientists. But it is not the form that is decisive, although the form may be the starting point. It is what the form reminds us of that is relevant, its content, in other words. The perfection of Michelangelo's statue of David, for example, can transport one from the physical realm to the non-physical, abstract perfection of God's creation in Heaven. The same inspiration can come from viewing a distorted body, however. It is entirely conditional on the viewer first choosing to shift from the wrong mind to the right mind, from identifying with the ego to identifying with the Atonement principle, that the separation never happened in reality. From another angle: since our minds are split, we are not totally insane; and therefore we are sometimes motivated by selflessness, defenselessness, and a willingness to see our interests as shared with everyone else's. Thus, the efforts of a scientist or doctor to relieve pain and reduce human misery can serve as a reminder of our ego-free state in our right minds, the reflection of our pure innocence and oneness as Christ. Jesus would never simply dismiss our efforts as meaningless in and of themselves--whether they be the \"higher strivings\" of humanity, or the humble efforts of a street cleaner to keep the neighborhood looking nice. Jesus looks only at the purpose, which can transcend self-centeredness, self-aggrandizement, or be limited solely to them. The value of our activities is associated only with their purpose, which is always the result of a decision made in our minds to see either shared or separate interests. We therefore can serve each other best by being reminders of the truth and flawless beauty of our immaculate Identity as Christ, which is reflected in our right minds, and which we witness to by our willingness to see all people as the same. Again, this may come through the work of scientists, artists, poets, or welders in a factory. It is always a matter of content, not form."

Let me not see it as a sign of sin and death, nor use it for destruction. Teach me how not to make of it an obstacle to peace, but let You use it for me, to facilitate its coming\" asks us not to use our perceptions as obstacles to peace but as facilitators of peace. Correct?  Does this mean even war? Is it possible that war, which we have chosen to hurt ourselves and others with, can become the means for our salvation?",
    "output": "Yes, you are correct. In fact, this prayer is a very clear statement about the process of forgiveness as taught in A Course in Miracles. As soon as we become aware of disquiet within, we recognize that we have judged wrongly and ask the Holy Spirit to judge the situation (or person) for us. It is in this way that our perceptions, which caused the disquiet and obstructed our peace, become facilitators of our peace. Your uncertainty is met with an unequivocal response of yes, this means even war. Any behavior in this world can become the means for our salvation: \" ... His use of what you made, to heal instead of harm\" (T-25.VI.4:1). This is why the focus of A Course in Miracles is not on behavior, but rather on changing our thoughts. Or more specifically, on changing with whom we think. Trying to change our behavior (or that of another), is actually trying to usurp the function of Holy Spirit: \"Correction is not your function. It belongs to One Who knows of fairness, not of guilt. If you assume correction's role, you lose the function of forgiveness\" (T-27.II.10:1-3). Once again, a very clear statement. Any ambiguity which arises in our practice of the Course must come from our fear of disidentifying with the ego, as Jesus could not state any more clearly the necessary steps for peace to be in our awareness. This being said, before \"going to war,\" one must be really clear that the ego is not involved."

I read and reread the \"Sickness is a defense against the Truth\" lesson 136. I have so much extra information in the form of Excerpts and Ken Wapnick audio. I am aware that the ego is doing this to keep me off balance and have me constantly identify with the body, making it very, very real. I wake so early and just lie there and try to stop the negative thoughts coming through. I ask the Holy Spirit to undo everything I have done to bring this on. I ask Jesus to take my hand and help me. But I always wind up falling in with the ego, and getting so angry that it makes my life much more difficult. It keeps me so worn out that it makes it difficult to remember to keep listening for the still, small voice. If only it were a big, booming voice.",
    "output": "You do not mention whether or not you are taking measures to help with your insomnia on the level of form. This is of course the place to start the healing process, since we do believe we are bodies and, as you say, we take the body very seriously by making it real. One can be faithful to the Course process of recognizing the ego at work, while using whatever remedies may help in treating the illness. As with so many of our problems the ego gets us coming and going. As you point out, your insomnia serves the ego in several ways--as an initial distraction, as a way of causing conflict, and as a great way to drown out \"the still small voice,\" not to mention the guilt at having engaged so vigorously with the ego in the whole process. It is indeed an exhausting situation which certainly exacerbates the effects of insomnia. Have you tried listening to your ACIM audios? If they don't put you to sleep, this would then be a useful way of spending the time you are awake, and would defeat the ego's goal of distraction and conflict. If, with this little willingness to hear the message of the Course during these early morning hours, you are no longer interested in trying to get to sleep, maybe the ego would give up using insomnia as a weapon. It is a particularly ingenious weapon since A Course in Miracles is teaching us how to awaken from the dream, and the ego chooses the \"lack of sleep\" as an attack device. In the ego's arsenal insomnia becomes the victimizer. Using the body in this way is the usual ego strategy designed to produce feelings of victimization, seemingly dissociated with the mind. The Course, on the other hand, tells us that the problem originates in the mind that made a choice to identify with the ego's world of separation and specialness prior to the insomnia and the ensuing anger. Although magic works to bring the problem into the dream in form, it does not work to bring about the correction. The Holy Spirit's help relies on our willingness to take responsibility for this choice in order to have the error undone. The negative thoughts you mention will not disappear without this willingness to take responsibility. Very often the honest recognition of saying; \"I am in this predicament (insomnia, or whatever) because \"I want to be an angry victim\", takes some of the punch out of it. At least it clears up some of the clutter in our confused minds and makes way for the beginning of healing. Feeling guilty about it will only add to the ego's scheme. What the Course advises with regards to the laws of chaos applies to the ego's goals in your insomnia, as with all ego schemes: \"Let us, then, look upon them calmly, that we may look beyond them, understanding what they are [ego lies that have no real effect], not what they would maintain [that the separation and the body are real]\" (T-23.II.1:4). \"Calmly\" is a very important word here; it means looking without judgment, without adding more guilt to the ego's fire. This process of looking honestly is how we wake up to the truth the Course is teaching us, and in this waking we find our rest: \"Rest does not come from sleeping but from waking\" (T-5.II.10:4)."

    "text_input": "Q #239: I have a question regarding the March 2003 Lighthouse article. The beginning, about \"regime change,\" made sense to me, and had me laughing. But at the end I was frustrated--I didn't know how to formulate how to act, or what actions to support. If the only sane response is forgiveness, does that mean we shouldn't try to stop people who are hurting others? Can we stop them lovingly? What if we have to kill them to stop them--can that be loving?",
    "output": "The answer to your questions lies in understanding the teachings of A Course in Miracles on forgiveness, which is not the same as the ego's version of forgiveness. Forgiveness, according to the ego, rests on seeing sin, and then forgiving it. It then esteems some \"sinners\" as deserving of forgiveness, and some as not. The important thing for the ego is making the error real by believing some harm has been done by one part of the Sonship to another, and that its effect is real. These beliefs are in full operation in a situation, such as the war in Iraq. It is a perfect opportunity to see the ego thought system in action--not on the battlefield of the Iraqi desert, but in our mind, which is where forgiveness is needed. It is also a perfect opportunity for forgiveness, as stated in the Lighthouse article. Forgiveness, as taught by the Course, begins by looking at the world, and events like the war in Iraq, paying attention to all the judgments and feelings that come up in us, and recognizing their source, which is the mind: \"It [the world] is the witness to your state of mind, the outside picture of an inward condition\" (T-21.in.1:5). The real war, therefore, is in our mind. The judgments and feelings are projections of the guilt in our own mind which is caused by our choice to identify with the ego's belief in the separation. The mind then becomes a battleground, and the war in the world merely reflects the conflict in the mind. Since this is an activity of the mind, it needs correction on the level of the mind, not on the level of form. As a student of the Course our part in \"ending the war\" lies in this forgiveness process. The next step in the Course's forgiveness process is the recognition that no true harm is done by the war: \"There is nothing to forgive. No one can hurt the Son of God\" (T-14.III.7:5-6). Any perceived damage is based on the belief that the separation and the body are real. Though in truth they are not, our belief makes them real in our awareness. As we watch the devastation of war on television we realize how much we do perceive damage and we do believe the body is real. All our reactions to the war come from this belief, along with so many other beliefs about how the world should work, who is responsible for the war, who are the victims, and on and on. The list of misperceptions is very long, particularly in an extreme example, such as war. It is this belief system that causes our upset, not the events of the war. And it is this belief system that brings about war in the world in the first place. That is why the real solution to war is forgiveness, not negotiation, or any specific action. However, while we turn within to see the turmoil in our own minds and seek help to undo our misperceptions, it is still possible to take action in the world. Just as we continue to take normal care of our bodies as we learn to undo our belief in them, so too we can do whatever we think may be helpful to resolve conflicts in the world. The decision is not whether or not to act, or what action to take, but with whom we make the decision: \"And make no mistake, nowhere in A Course in Miracles does Jesus suggest that we not act in the world; only that we not act alone\" (The Lighthouse, Vol. 14, No. 1, p. 5). Is the purpose of taking action to reinforce the ego's belief in victims and victimizers, taking sides with those who are \"good\" against those who are \"evil\", or are we willing to ask the Holy Spirit to help us see that everyone in the war is a brother calling for help, rather than a sinner, and that their truth remains inviolate no matter how insane their ego behavior is? Whatever form the action takes will then reflect the belief system of the teacher we have chosen: the ego or the Holy Spirit. Choosing to accept the Holy Spirit's perception is the only loving response in any situation, including war. When these steps are taken it is possible to stop an aggressor from physically hurting someone else without attack. If the only way to do this is by killing another, and if a person has clearly chosen to identify with the Holy Spirit, not the ego, in principle the killing can also be done without attack, without judgment, and without guilt. There are probably very few people who would fall into this category. It may indeed be more loving to stop someone from killing another (although not necessarily), but that would only be clear if you are coming from the right mind, having chosen the Holy Spirit, and not from fear. In applying the principles of the Course to any situation in the world the only important thing to remember is the content of the mind, not the form. The mind is what we are being trained to be aware of, and it is the mind that is in need of healing. A last consideration, but certainly not the least, is the Course teaching that there is no death: \"There is no death because what God created shares His life. There is no death because an opposite to God does not exist. There is no death because the Father and the Son are One\" (W- pI.167.1:5-7). It is when we perceive ourselves and others as separate that the Son of God is \"murdered.\" It follows that a person who claims to support peace and brotherhood, but is filled with judgment against political leaders responsible for war, inflicts a death penalty on the Son of God, while a soldier who fully identifies with the Holy Spirit's perception and knows his oneness with all brothers, can perform his duty, which includes killing, with the Holy Spirit's love that flows through him. This is possible only by joining with the Holy Spirit in the mind: \"He brings forgiving dreams, in which the choice is not who is the murderer and who shall be the victim. In the dreams He brings there is no murder and there is no death\" (T-27.VII.14:4-5)."

To reinforce the thought system of sin, guilt, fear, differences and specialness?

The Course process does not involve any fusion of polarities--that would be more in line with the Jungian approach of reconciling opposites, where both poles are afforded reality, but a higher level of experience is arrived at by their integration. In the Course, even such seeming dualities as love and fear, or light and darkness, are not really opposites for, as the Course observes at the very beginning, \"The opposite of love is fear, but what is all-encompassing can have no opposite\" (T-in.1:8). Fear and darkness have no reality and so there is no possibility to integrate them with their \"opposite.\" Rather, we need to step back and look at the fear and the darkness with the Holy Spirit until, over time, we come to recognize their illusory nature. And in that recognition is the realization that there is nothing to overcome. There is no war to be waged against duality. All that is needed is a shift in perception that produces a totally different perspective, from above the oppositional battlefield. As for your specific experience of a powerful \"goddess\" energy, the Course would make no specific judgment except to have you ask yourself: Was this experience of power in any way associated with seeing yourself in opposition to anyone else, as having separate interests, such as a female-male split? If so, it would have reflected an alignment of your thinking with the ego thought system. If however, the experience was one of shared, mutual possibilities for yourself with everyone else, excluding no one, it would be a reflection of right-minded thinking. For it is your interpretation of that experience of power that determines what you have used it for, as we noted above."

    "text_input": "Q #241: Jesus, for me, is a symbol of God's Love in my mind, that I use interchangeably with that of the Holy Spirit, for looking at the blocks (grievances) in my mind. I do not proselytize A Course in Miracles, and indeed feel that everyone must choose their own spiritual pathway. Recently however I read where someone on the internet suggested that any one using the Course or Jesus, had formed a special relationship with both. I do not see it that way. Could you give me your opinions on this?",
    "output": "As long as we have any belief that the separation is real, and as long as we identify with the body to any degree, all of our relationships begin as special: \" ... every relationship on which the ego embarks is special\" (T-15.VII.1:7). In A Course in Miracles, the term \"special\" refers to the belief that since we are separate individuals in bodies, we are incomplete, and have need of persons, things, and events outside of ourselves to be made complete. In other words, anyone who perceives any need in themselves (this means just about everyone) brings specialness to all their relationships. Only those who have accepted the Atonement for themselves do not relate with specialness. The fact that Jesus (or the Holy Spirit) is perceived as different, in that he symbolizes the memory of God's love in the mind, makes him special. In truth, we are not only one with the symbols of the memory of God, we are one with God at home in Heaven. Only this is not special. For the sake of clarity, it might be helpful to substitute the word \"separate\" for special. Wherever perceived separateness or differences are, there specialness is. It is the inevitable outcome of belief in separation. When the Course says \"The Holy Spirit knows no one is special\" (T- 15.V.5:1), it means no one is separate, also meaning not in need of anything or anyone. When we identify fully with the Holy Spirit in our minds, we will no longer have a special relationship with Him, with Jesus, or with the Course, because we will no longer perceive ourselves as separate. Meanwhile, we still perceive ourselves as incomplete, and in need of help to accept the Atonement for ourselves, and, we establish special relationships with everything. Again, \"For every relationship on which the ego embarks is special\" (T-15.VII.1:7). Only by recognizing this can the special relationships become a classroom the Holy Spirit uses to transform them. We initially turn to the Course and to Jesus out of a sense of need. This does make them special. It is necessary to recognize this so we can allow our relationship with them, along with everyone else, to be transformed. If we deny this, we deny ourselves the opportunity to look at the beliefs that underlie our sense of need and incompleteness, thus withholding them from the power of healing. In the end, we will learn that we have no need. Until then, remember that \"This course is a beginning, not an end\" (W-ep.1:1). Jesus knows we come to him with our specialness intact. In fact, he tells us we must forgive him: \"Forgive me, then, today. And you will know you have forgiven me if you behold your brother in the light of holiness. He cannot be less holy than can I, and you can not be holier than he\" (W-pII.288.2). As long as we perceive ourselves as different than Jesus--separate from him--we bring specialness to our relationship with him, and need to \"forgive him\" for our mistaken beliefs."

    "text_input": "Q #242: I am confused by A Course in Miracles' use of the word conditions. We are not to ask for help with the \"release of fear,\" but rather to ask \"for help in the conditions that have brought the fear about.\" Would you say it's also appropriate to ask for help in bringing \"proper learning conditions\" about?...for help in bringing about the conditions for peace? ... for help in bringing about the conditions for love?...etc. I assume it's talking about conditions of mind.",
    "output": "Yes, the term conditions always refers to a choice made in our minds, which accounts for our lack of peace, for our not being aware of love's presence, etc. The point of the passage you are referring to (T-2.VI.4) is that Jesus was helping Helen and all of us to learn to take responsibility for our thoughts and feelings, so that we can get back in touch with the power of our minds to choose. We essentially chose to repress this power and become mindless instead when we gave our allegiance to the ego. So Jesus is saying that it really would not be helpful to us in the long run, if he simply took our fear away from us, without our having learned that it is there only because of our ongoing choice to prefer separation to oneness (the conditions that led to the fear). He tells us several paragraphs later: \"You may still complain about fear, but you nevertheless persist in making yourself fearful. I have already indicated that you cannot ask me to release you from fear. I know it does not exist, but you do not. If I intervened between your thoughts and their results, I would be tampering with a basic law of cause and effect; the most fundamental law there is. I would hardly help you if I depreciated the power of your own thinking. This would be in direct opposition to the purpose of this course. It is much more helpful to remind you that you do not guard your thoughts carefully enough\" (T-2.VII.1:1-7). So Jesus is emphasizing the importance of guarding our thoughts very carefully, just as the entire workbook comes back over and over again to the importance of our being vigilant about our thoughts. That is what he wants to help us with: looking at how willing we are to keep ourselves separate and special, how willing we are to see others as the sinners and ourselves as innocent victims. These are the conditions that result in our fear and our lack of peace, etc. Thus is it very appropriate to ask for help in bringing about the conditions that would facilitate our learning, and that would bring about the conditions for peace and love, etc. If we were to look with him at all of our ego thoughts, and then let them go, fear and guilt would vanish forever, and then the love that had been blocked by the fear would be our only reality. All fear and guilt rest on our willingness to choose against the love of Jesus and for the ego, which ensures our survival as separate individuals. Finally, if we ask him to help us look at our choice to keep him away, then we have already begun the process of correcting that choice. That is the kind of help that would benefit us most."

    "text_input": "Q #243: Some verses in the New Testament seem to speak of an \"unpardonable sin\" against the Holy Spirit. What is A Course in Miracles' view of those passages?",
    "output": "The Course always views sin as part of the illusory ego thought system. It has no basis in reality. Therefore there are no pardonable or unpardonable sins, parallel to the principle that there is no hierarchy of illusions. The ego attempts to keep sin real in our minds because that is what keeps its own existence real. Without a notion of sin, there would be no need for dynamics to cope with its effects. Jesus talks about this in the Course by teaching us that we have done nothing in reality that would warrant the label sin. What we would be inclined to call sin--our attack on God by separating from Him--is simply a \"tiny, mad idea,\" easily corrected by making the choice to accept the Atonement principle, which states that the separation never happened; and therefore there is no such thing as sin."

But since we think we are here as individuals in a world, Jesus talks to us on that level in order to help us begin the process of awakening from the dream we call life. In that context, Jesus says that our goal is to achieve a state of abiding peace in our minds, which is the natural outcome of the practice of forgiveness. \"Happiness,\" he says, \"cannot be found apart from Your joint Will [with God]\" (T-11.V.12:4), which is reflected in our choice to see our interests as shared with everyone else's, not separate from them. We might say that no happiness the world offers can match the happiness we would experience when we experience the oneness and sinlessness of God's Son."

The Glossary-Index for A Course in Miracles by Kenneth Wapnick defines Atonement as \"the Holy Spirit's plan of correction to undo the ego and heal the belief in separation.\" The term at-one-ment is not used in the Course. The Course tells us \"the sole responsibility of God's Teacher is to accept the Atonement for himself\" (M-18.4:5), meaning to no longer believe that the separation is real. The term oneness in the Course refers to the unity of the Father and the Son in Heaven, and is reflected in the dream by joining with another through forgiveness. Neither of these principles of the Course's thought system is expressed by the term at-one-ment."

    "text_input": "Q #246: I've been studying and practicing A Course in Miracles for almost six years, usually on a daily basis. It has helped me a lot, but I still need help to understand and deal with addictions. According to my ego, I am addicted to alcohol and cigarettes. According to God, I am His beloved daughter. How to deal with this? Don't tell me to stop hearing my ego, it sounds like a green light to addictions. I feel there's a deeper ground to think about. Professional advice seems to reinforce sickness, guilt and sacrifice. The Course tells me I don't have to do anything, to put it in the Holy Spirit's hand. But I need further help in letting it be, in opening myself to a lesson I don't quite understand, in not paying so much attention to the world's point of view. Please, let me know if there is something in A Course in Miracles, or elsewhere, I am overlooking.",
    "output": "First, it is difficult for us to understand the nature of the specific lessons we have in our lives. We cannot see the whole picture in our minds, because we are still so fearful of regaining that part of our identity that we have split off and concealed from ourselves. In one sense, though, we don't have to know why we chose the conditions we did, because the remedy the Course provides is so clear. Whatever the condition, the only relevant issue is whether we choose to have Jesus or the ego guide us through it. If we choose Jesus or the Holy Spirit, we will wind up feeling more peaceful, regardless of whether the condition changes or not; and we will be more inclined to be gentle and kind with ourselves and others. If we choose the ego, we will wind up feeling more guilty or hopeless; we will continue to have thoughts of self-blame and self-pity, and to hold others responsible for our plight. We will remain preoccupied with the body and will be anything but peaceful. Putting yourself in the Holy Spirit's hands, as the Course views this, involves accepting responsibility for whatever state you are in, and letting go of any thoughts of blame--either self- blame or blaming others--and then adopting a kind and gentle attitude towards yourself. The lesson the Holy Spirit or Jesus would help you with is learning that peace of mind is not conditional on physical/psychological health, or on anything external to your mind and Their loving presence in your mind. As you concentrate on learning that lesson, the thoughts that oppose it would come to the surface, and you would then bring those ego thoughts to the loving presence in your mind, where you could choose either to hold on to them or let them go. The patience and gentleness would be manifest in your assurance that when you are ready to let go of the addictions, you will, and that holding on to them is not something sinful, nor something you need to be ashamed of. Nothing we do with or to our bodies can have any affect on the love that is held for us in our right minds. Thus, putting yourself in the hands of the Holy Spirit does not mean that it is then up to Him to do something about your addictions. Rather, it means that you have made a decision to use the Holy Spirit's way of looking at what is going on instead of the ego's way of looking, which will always leave you believing that you are a vulnerable, victimized body. Finally, the choice to seek professional help many times can be a loving response to the call for help that is behind the self-hatred and guilt; it can be an expression of kindness toward oneself as a way of undoing that self-hatred. You seem to imply, however, that you have tried traditional methods of treatment, and that they have not been helpful to you. We have addressed this in previous questions asked of us: #30, #57, and #119. In case it might be of help, we are summarizing the explanations the Course gives us that can be applied to conditions such as addictions. Although the term is never used in the Course, an addiction is nothing more than a special relationship, and there is a great deal in the Course about special relationships. Addictions frequently are the result of overwhelming feelings of self-hatred and guilt. The pain is so great that it must be neutralized in some way. Overindulgence in alcohol and cigarettes (or any number of other forms--food, sex, wealth, luxury, etc.) is often chosen as a means of dulling this pain. Abusing your body through addictions can also be a way of punishing yourself for being such a \"bad\" person, a belief that your self-hatred and guilt testifies to. It could also be a means of punishing someone else: you could be pointing an accusing finger at someone and saying, \"It's your fault that I am an addict. You made me this way.\" Paraphrasing a line from the text: Behold me brother, at your hands I am an addict (T-27.I.4:6); also, \"I am the thing you made of me, and as you look on me, you stand condemned because of what I am\" (T-31.V.5:3). We all have a need to get rid of the pain of our self-hatred and guilt, and so we would even be willing to suffer intensely just so that we could blame it on someone else. The payoff is that we would feel like the innocent victim of what someone else did to us. As with any form of sickness--physical or psychological--being addicted reinforces the belief that the body is real, and can be victimized. When we are preoccupied with the body in any or all of these ways, we more than likely have made a prior decision to keep from our awareness our true identity as spirit. Any form of preoccupation with the body is a defense against the truth. The truth about ourselves can be so frightening to us--when we allow it into awareness even for a split second--that we then do whatever would most effectively banish that truth from our awareness. So we make ourselves mindless in the sense of being at the mercy of some force not under our control. Our real beauty and strength as God's Son can be so frightening to us that we substitute an identity of weakness and dependency, and then repress the real origin of it and attribute it to some factor in our own body, another's, or some condition in the world. To sum up then, the real issue is: Now that the addiction is there, what do I do about it? And as Jesus reminds us, we need only think in terms of purpose, or \"What is it for?\" (T-17.VI.2:2). We know that to the ego, the purpose of addictions is to reinforce guilt; and to the Holy Spirit the purpose is changed to a means of undoing guilt. \"The Son of God can make no choice the Holy Spirit cannot employ on his behalf, and not against himself\" (T-25.VI.7:5). So it comes down to discerning whether you are choosing the ego or the Holy Spirit as your teacher."

    "text_input": "Q #247: Many denominations of \"traditional\" Christianity prohibit homosexual relationships, while promoting heterosexual ones. With A Course in Miracles being provided within the context of Christianity, are \"same-sex\" relationships similarly prohibited?",
    "output": "To begin with, the Course comes in a Christian context, but it is not simply another form of Christianity, or another denomination. Second, the Course says nothing about this issue. It neither forbids homosexual relationships nor promotes heterosexual ones. In fact, it says nothing about any form of behavior, because that is not its focus. The focus of the teaching is always on our thinking and our beliefs, which are the source of our behavior. One of its major teachings is that the world and the body, along with the multitude of issues connected with them, serve mainly as smokescreens to keep us from looking into our minds, where the source of all our problems and dilemmas are located. That is the purpose of the world and the body. Ultimately, of course, both are illusory. So the focus of the Course is always on correcting the thinking going on in our minds that leaves us preoccupied with what is essentially illusory. That is where the help is needed, and therefore that is the whole orientation of the Course. In brief, then, when we choose against the ego's thought system of hate and separation, and for the Holy Spirit's thought system of love and shared interests, our behavior would always be an expression of that love and oneness with which we have identified. Finally as with anything in our lives, the only relevant aspect is purpose: \"In any situation in which you are uncertain, the first thing to consider, very simply, is 'What do I want to come of this? What is it for?' The clarification of the goal belongs at the beginning, for it is this which will determine the outcome\" (T-17.VI.2:1-3). Thus, both homosexuality and heterosexuality can be used either to reinforce guilt (the ego's purpose) or to undo guilt (the Holy Spirit's purpose). That is why directing our attention to our choice of teachers is absolutely central to our work with the Course. Concentrating on that will help to keep things simple."

    "text_input": "Q #250: In Kenneth Wapnick's book Forgiveness & Jesus, he says on page xv in the Preface: \"Jesus and the Holy Spirit do not operate in the world, and certainly do not send people as if they were operating a giant chess board, moving us around according to the evolution of the plan of salvation.\" However, the manual for teachers of A Course in Miracles says: \"There are no accidents in salvation. Those who are to meet will meet, because together they have the potential for a holy relationship\" (M-3.1:6-7); and then later it says, \"Remember that no one is where he is by accident, and chance plays no part in God's plan\" (M-9.1:3). This indicates that meeting certain people is part of God's plan, and as I have understood the Course, the Holy Spirit is operating in the illusion to help us, just as the Course is made within the framework of the illusion. Meetings are part of God's plan--there are no accidents--so how can this be interpreted?",
    "output": "There are no accidents because everything has already happened, and we are simply reviewing mentally what has already gone by: \"The script is written. ... we but see the journey from the point at which it ended, looking back on it, imagining we make it once again; reviewing mentally what has gone by\" (W-pI.158.4:3-5). In \"The Little Hindrance\" Jesus tells us: \"To you who still believe you live in time and know not it is gone, the Holy Spirit still guides you through the infinitely small and senseless maze you still perceive in time, though it has long since gone. You think you live in what is past\" (T-26.V.4:1-2). So people are in our lives only because that is what our scripts involve. We have no recollection of our having written these scripts (a metaphor, of course), which is part of the ego's strategy to keep us from remembering that we are decision-making minds. You might wish to consult Kenneth's A Vast Illusion: Time According to \"A Course in Miracles,\" which is an in-depth study of this intriguing part of the Course's theory. We are inclined to view what the Course says from our perspective, which is that the world and linear time are real. And that is why we would think that the Holy Spirit and Jesus actually do things, such as direct us to specific people so that we can learn our lessons of forgiveness. But that could not be, since there is no world, and time is not real, either. It is helpful to review the levels of language in the Course, and why Jesus speaks to us as if our experience in the world and linear time were real. Earlier answers to questions have developed these topics, and we refer you to them for further study: Questions  #72 and  #116."

    "text_input": "Q #251: With world conditions the way they are, I am reminded of a section in Robert Skutch's book, Journey Without Distance (p. 60), regarding Helen's asking Jesus what A Course in Miracles was for, and the answer she received: \"The world situation is worsening to an alarming  degree. People all over the world are being called on to help, and are making their individual contributions as part of an overall prearranged plan. Because of the acute emergency, the usual slow, evolutionary process is being by-passed in what might best be described as a 'celestial speed-up.' \"Helen could sense the urgency that lay behind this 'explanation' ... and strongly sensed that what was being conveyed to her was that time was running out.\" What does this mean exactly? What is the absolute worst that could happen? Even if we destroyed every living thing on the planet wouldn't we still be alive in spirit? Is there, in reality, anything to worry about?",
    "output": "First, a clarification of the \"celestial speed-up.\" This was Helen's personal experience; it was a way for her to understand the unsettling experiences that were occurring in her life at that time (1965), without increasing the fear that was already present. She had not yet come across the theory of time as totally illusory, which Jesus would explain much later; that would have been far too upsetting to her in those early months. And so the content of Jesus' message was expressed in a form that was meaningful to Helen and with which she could be reasonably comfortable. Most likely, Helen would not have expressed the meaning in that form years later, after she had seen the complete picture. Forgetting about this form/content distinction has led many students to take Helen's \"celestial-speedup\" explanation literally. When the unreality of time is brought into the discussion, it is obvious that there could not literally be a need to speed things up. The situation in the world can worsen and be cause for concern only if the world is real, and time also is both real and linear. (See Absence from Felicity: The Story of Helen Schucman and Her Scribing of A Course in Miracles, pp. 464-65) Secondly, destruction of any kind can emanate only from the ego thought system. Just because Planet Earth might no longer exist does not mean that we would have returned to our true Identity as spirit. The pain in our minds tortured with self-hatred does not disappear simply because the planet has been blown up. If we (\"Who is the 'you' who are living in this world?\" [T-4.II.11:8]) destroyed the planet, we might be very much \"alive,\" but in the guilt of our wrong minds, not in the innocence and purity of spirit, as Christ. We would still be caught up in the dream of sin, guilt, and fear, and their projection. In other words, as minds, we would be perceiving a destroyed planet, and our guilt, which we have not let go of, would then manifest in some other form. Understanding that the world is not real and that we are not our bodies is a step in the right direction--a major step; but our healing is not yet complete. It is very comforting to be assured that the world and bodies are not real, because we would no longer fear that the end of the planet is the end of \"us.\" That dimension of our terror subsides, fortunately, which then frees us to move to the next step, which is experiencing ourselves as decision-making minds that are constantly choosing to identify with either the ego's or the Holy Spirit's thought system. We must look at our investment in upholding the purpose served by our belief in sin, guilt, and fear. Ultimately, we must reach the level of readiness to let go of all sense of individuality, consciousness, and specialness before we return to our existence as spirit. The interim stage, though, is the right-minded awareness that we are the dreamers of the dream. This is the stage in which we consistently choose to perceive everything from \"above the battleground,\" confidently assured that all destruction and suffering, all pleasure and excitement, are but the outcome of a mind dreaming it has separated from the Oneness of Heaven."

Does this mean that there is a \"redeemer\" figure in different worlds in every dimension of  time? I've heard of this idea many years ago, but still know nothing about it. So as well as Jesus appearing in different forms in the Sonship's dream of living on another world, could this also mean A Course in Miracles has, or will appear in other forms, in other worlds also, not excluding the fact it could also come again into this world in another, even more sophisticated form!",
    "output": "You've got it! Rather than seeing time in a linear way, picture it holographically (the entire history of the whole physical universe contained within each of our minds), and you can better understand how it is that a \"redeemer\" figure can be in all places at all times. As the Course states: \"The tiny tick of time in which the first mistake was made, and all of them within that one mistake, held also the Correction for that one, and all of them that came within the first\" (T- 26.V.3:5). There is a hologram of \"error,\" which contains every possible \"sin,\" and the ramifications thereof. There is also a hologram of \"Correction,\" along with its ramifications (redeemer figures, spiritual teachings, etc.). At any time, at any place, we are choosing one of these two holograms. Gloria and Kenneth Wapnick deal with the nature of the separation and the Course's view of time in Question 16 of The Most Commonly Asked Questions About A Course in Miracles: \"...when the thought of separation is projected \"far away\" from the mind of the Son, it is expressed in the dimension of time: The past, the seeming present, and the future do appear to reflect the huge gap of billions of years the ego wishes to introduce between the mind's decision to be separate from God and the Holy Spirit, and the Son's experience of himself as a body. When the thought of separation is experienced between an individual and another person--i.e., closer to his experience of himself--then it is known as space, the physical gap we experience between ourselves and others in our special relationships. To state this another way, time (and therefore space as well) was specifically made by the ego to keep cause (the mind and its thoughts) and effect (our pain and suffering) separated.\" And yes, this does mean a more sophisticated form of teaching may appear in the world, and this is dependent upon the Son's mind being more fully healed. As healing takes place, and a clear understanding and appreciation of the ego's strategy is accepted, higher teachings are then possible."

    "text_input": "Q #253: I understand that we made the world outside to appear real, based on error. Also, in A Course in Miracles it mentions that every time a problem arises we do not look at the problem itself (which will make it \"more real\"). Instead, we look within. It is like saying if worldly things (including obligations) are all unreal, then we can simply \"drop it\" or \"let go\" (let God). It is like saying--forget about taxes, or bills, or the whole world, because they are not real. However, in the Course Jesus teaches, or at least mentions, how to look (outside or inside) without judgment (because there is nothing to judge). Please share your kind guidance to clarify this delusion. A: A Course in Miracles is a spiritual path designed as a learning program. In this context, the world, and all the circumstances of our lives, become the classroom for learning and applying the Course principles. Everything in our lives is therefore very important to our learning, and is not meant to be merely \"dropped.\" It is meant to be examined, reinterpreted and transformed.",
    "output": "Although in truth the world is an illusion (W-pI.155.2:1), it is very real to those who perceive themselves as separate from God, which includes most of us. In order to apply the principles of the Course to our lives, it is important not to confuse levels of teaching. The Course does not ask us to stop doing any of the things we do in the world as bodies. This is not a Course in behavior--it is a Course in mind training. A Course in Miracles is addressing the mind, and is concerned only with the content of the mind. Dealing with a perceived problem in the world is not what makes the error real. It is believing that the perceived problem is the cause of our upset and has an effect on the truth of who we are which makes the error real in our awareness, though not in truth. When the Course asks us to look within, it does not say ignore or disregard the problem as it is perceived in the world. In fact, it tells us we must look at what we have made: \"No one can escape from illusions unless he looks at them, for not looking is the way they are protected. There is no need to shrink from illusions, for they cannot be dangerous ...The \"dynamics\" of the ego will be our lesson for a while, for we must look first at this to see beyond it, since you have made it real. We will undo this error quietly together, and then look beyond it to truth\" (T-11.V.1:1-2,5-6; italics added). Thus, the steps involved in applying the Course's teaching begin with seeing the problem as we have made it up in the world, dealing with the problem in the normal way (i.e., paying taxes and bills), while learning to recognize that the problem is made up as a smokescreen for the real problem, which is the choice in the mind to take the thought of separation seriously. Recognizing the purpose the ego assigns to the world's problems is what the Course means by \"looking within.\" Since we believe the world with its bills and taxes is real, we do have judgments which need to be acknowledged because they reveal our hidden beliefs in scarcity, victimization, etc. This is part of the process of looking within. The world and our feelings are showing us the \"dark secrets\" (T-22.VI.9:5) our minds contain. They cannot be dispelled if we are unaware of them. In the same way, belief in the body cannot be undone by denying it and then ignoring the specific conditions of life in a body. Not paying bills or taxes would certainly bring on an avalanche of other problems. The exacerbated situation would reinforce the ego's smokescreen, and would not facilitate healing. Only when the real problem--belief in separation--is recognized can we turn to the Holy Spirit in our minds to seek the real solution--undoing the belief in separation through forgiveness. Once this is accomplished, we will be ready to believe that the world with all its \"problems\" is not real, and move beyond it to the truth."

    "text_input": "Q #254: My question has to do with judgment. Since I have been studying A Course in Miracles, I have been very careful to see everyone beyond the body, as myself, as the Son of God. I know they are exactly the same and sinless just like me and I don't let their, or my, behavior cloud this knowledge. With this filter always in the forefront of my mind, is it wrong to make observations about myself and others, and then label the behavior? For example, my mother was acting selfishly and with prejudice in my presence; or admitting to myself that I was acting selfishly and with prejudice. It seems impossible not to have some kind of physical reaction to what is in front of us, whether a person or a situation. I am not judging them badly; I am just noticing something and then letting it have no effect on my thoughts about them or me.",
    "output": "You are on the right track. The thrust of our practice is to \"deny the denial of truth\" (T- 12.II.1:5), which means we must first observe the ego, and then choose to deny that it has any power to affect the reality of God's Son. This world is the manifestation of a choice within our minds to attack and reject the Love of God; therefore it would be impossible not to see expressions of hatred, specialness, selfishness, and fear all around us all the time. Jesus is teaching us that we need to bring these perceptions to him, and then ask his help to look at them with him, so that we will get beyond judgment and condemnation. He ultimately wants us to be able to experience ourselves and everyone else as the same. Our starting point, though, is looking honestly at how attracted we are to seeing differences, to judging, and to condemning others for their faults and sins. We would not be experiencing ourselves as bodies in the world if we were not attracted to that. It is second-nature to us; but it is not sinful. So that is where the process of healing must begin. Then we can learn that beneath our hatred, fear, selfishness, and all of our neediness, is a call for mercy, and a plea to be told that we are wrong about ourselves. We are all the same on both of these levels. As we learn how to approach everyone and all situations from that perspective, we will become kinder and more compassionate, and we will share Jesus' vision of ourselves and everyone else. This is not accomplished through denying our reactions and our observations, however. Our reactions and observations are the classroom into which we invite Jesus, who will then teach us how to share his loving, kind perception."

    "text_input": "Q #255: I am from Brazil, and have been practicing A Course in Miracles for the last 21 years. I have gone through it about three times completely, and I am going through it again now. This time I have felt the real presence of the Light, of the Christ that exists in me when I do the exercises; the absence of the physical body, the real joy of being. But, on the other side, my life is so complicated now, and it seems that the multiplication (things to do, people to care for, responsibilities of the day-by-day life, with all those magic things to organize, calculate, pay for, etc.) is getting to an unbearable state. It seems that the ego is trying to make my way difficult. What do you think? What can I do to reach, constantly, all the time, the state of mind that we get when doing the exercises--of total peace and joy? A: It is difficult to know the specific reason for your life becoming more complicated. It could well be a reaction to your getting closer to letting go of your ego; but there really is no way of knowing that for sure. That does not really matter, though, because the solution would always be the same. The solution is to focus on the purpose, which you can discern by the results. In other words, the increased complications have resulted in your loss of inner peace and joy; therefore, that must be the purpose of these recent occurrences. That really is all you have to know. Somewhere in your mind, you (the decision-making part of your mind) became afraid of being peaceful, and so you came up with a way of \"protecting\" yourself from that peace and all that it represents. The preferred defense of most of us is to become preoccupied with our lives as bodies. That quickly does away with any thought that we might be something else. All that you need to do is to take responsibility for the state you are in and bring it to Jesus or the Holy Spirit in your mind, which means that you would not judge yourself or feel bad about it. When you no longer need the defense, you will just deal with your obligations and responsibilities the best you can, with the love of Jesus guiding you. They would no longer be experienced as \"unbearable,\" because you would see them as classrooms in which you are",
    "output": "learning that the peace and joy in your mind has nothing to do with anything external. If you truly knew that everything of the body and the world is intended to keep you from finding out that the source of all your distress is a choice you are making in your mind, then you would eagerly turn to Jesus or the Holy Spirit to help you give your experience a different purpose. \"The world was made that problems could not be escaped\" (T-31.IV.2:6). Rather than seeing them as burdens, your day-by-day responsibilities could be seen as the means you are using to restore to your awareness the love that is your true and eternal Identity. Each interaction could then be regarded as an opportunity to learn that your interests are not really separate from anyone else's, despite the appearance of major differences. The specifics of each situation (the form) then become less important than the meaning (the content), which is to undo your belief in separation, and accept back the identity we all share as one. Your day-by-day life is your \"laboratory\" in this sense. It was originally intended to keep you from the truth; now with the help of Jesus or the Holy Spirit, it becomes the means of your return to God."

    "text_input": "Q #256: In my relationship with my boss, I am having difficulty knowing the difference between the right and wrong mind. I try to practice the principles of generosity, tolerance, and patience described in the manual for teachers, but we have communication problems regarding my salary. My earnings change at his whim, making me feel powerless and underpaid. I am afraid that I will lose my job if I ask for what I think is really my due. Though money is not everything to me, I read in the Psychotherapy pamphlet that an unhealed healer may demand money where the Holy Spirit might guide otherwise. I seem to be afraid of everything and always at fault somewhere. Is this the pain of a special relationship? Can you tell me if I am trying to be too good? Am I trying to apply the principles of A Course in Miracles with the ego, fearing the true guidance of the Holy Spirit? Do I suffer from an inverse form of poverty, which expresses itself in false generosity?",
    "output": "In studying the Course, it is important to remember that it speaks to us on different levels. We are learning to undo the ego thought system with which we have identified, while learning an entirely new way of perceiving. We seem to have a foot in two worlds and this can be very confusing. The wrong mind sees the problem as outside of the mind caused by an external agent, in this case your boss. The right mind recognizes that the cause is in the mind and the world of form is the effect. It does not blame any situation on anything outside of the mind. An easy way to distinguish which part of the mind has been chosen, is to ask if you are attributing the cause of your upset to something outside of yourself. This is a simple way of distinguishing the wrong mind from the right mind. Recognizing that the cause of any upset is a choice in the mind is the beginning of right minded thinking. It is not the whole story, but it is a beginning. Since we still believe we are separate, individual bodies in the world, we have to deal with the world and our relationships accordingly. We continue to do whatever we must do to meet our perceived needs in the body. There is nothing wrong with working out an agreement with your boss about your salary. You can be honest about what you feel would be a just wage, and perhaps request a schedule for changes so your salary doesn't fluctuate unpredictably, if that is possible. This is no different from any of the things we do to take care of the body. The Course does not give any guidelines for behavior on the level of form. Rather, it is teaching us to expose the thoughts and judgments we hold about ourselves and others in our minds, so the mind can be healed. Only then will the characteristics of a teacher of God, described in the manual, flow naturally from the healed mind. They are not meant to be \"exercised\" or \"practiced\" while there are underlying beliefs that oppose them. The practice of the Course rests in finding all the hidden beliefs that are in operation in your relationship with your boss, and with everyone. These are the beliefs in separation, scarcity, and victimization that do in fact make all our relationships special. The way to undo the specialness is to expose the beliefs by recognizing them and bringing them to the Holy Spirit to be transformed. We are not being asked to practice holy qualities that we do not in fact possess, such as detachment from material wealth or other \"virtuous\" mind sets. We are not being asked to be \"good\" at all (by the way, neither are we expected to go out of our way to \"bad\"). We are asked only to look at our beliefs with a willingness to have them transformed. That is not always as easy as it seems, because we have such a desire to hold on to them. We are asked to become aware of our attachment to these beliefs and how much we do not want them to be changed. We cling to them in spite of the guilt and pain they cause. Actually it is because of the guilt and pain that we do cling to them. This is what the Course refers to as the attraction of guilt: \"The sick attraction of guilt must be recognized for what it is. For having been made real to you, it is essential to look at it clearly, and by withdrawing your investment in it, to learn to let it go\" (T-15.VII.3:1-2). This is the guidance the Holy Spirit gives. There is no imposition of His thought system, and no behavior in the world that is required. Behind all concerns about money, poverty, and injustice is the feeling of lack and deprivation that comes from the belief that our separation from God has truly been accomplished. That is the fundamental belief that the Holy Spirit is inviting us to question. It is the belief that underlies all the conflict with your boss. While you work with your boss toward reaching an agreement about your salary, you can apply the teachings of the Course by being very honest with yourself about what you are feeling, and the thoughts of judgment that occur to you. These thoughts and feelings represent the choice to identify with the ego's thought system in the mind, which is where healing is needed. When they are brought to the light of the Holy Spirit they are gradually transformed and replaced with His peace. Only then will the issue of more or less money be irrelevant, and generosity, tolerance, and patience will replace all fear. Until that point is reached, honesty with yourself about your perceived needs, and honesty with your boss in searching for an agreement is the best place for practicing the Course. Believing that an agreement is possible is already a recognition that to some extent you and your boss do not have separate interests. And that is the beginning of healing."

    "text_input": "Q #257: In #128, you state that by practicing forgiveness, one could stop taking medication for antidepressants. While this may ultimately be true, I have seen the physical and mental anguish that accompanies depression, and I believe that someone, if they are clinically depressed, would be a much better student of A Course in Miracles while taking their antidepressants than by not taking them. Clinical depression wrecks the brain's ability to function. Yes, it seems to be related to an overemphasis on guilt and punishment--yet when in this condition, one's ability to function or think clearly is severely impaired. As long as we perceive ourselves in a body, should we not seek medical attention to make us think and behave clearly? Is it not easier to address our real problems in a state of sound mind? In fact, knowing that one might solve their depression through total forgiveness might even cause more depression when one fails and remains depressed. Is it not true that what we do here on earth, in our physical bodies, is an illusion? Is a body that takes anti-depressants any different from a body that does not? Aren't they both  illusions? There is no hierarchy of illusions. Is seeking spiritual help to make us a better \"body\" --i.e., no antidepressants, really a worthy spiritual goal with the Course?",
    "output": "Oh no, you misunderstood! The \"flip\" answer \"Forgive\" at the beginning was qualified in the rest of the response. The goal, as you say, is not to stop taking the antidepressant, any more than it would be to stop eating or sleeping. The Course never advises us to change our behavior, only our mind (T-2.VI.3:4). The things you say are true and are in line with the point being made in the answer to Question 128. It makes much more sense to continue taking the antidepressant and to get in touch with the implicit judgment about taking the medication, than to have a goal of getting off the medication. It is true that forgiveness is the way to move beyond any of the world's magic, but so long as we see ourselves as bodies, we will depend on magic--including breathing oxygen!--to keep the self we believe we are alive and functioning. Only at the very end of the forgiveness process, when we have accepted the Atonement for ourselves, do personal needs disappear, and with them the need for any form of external interventions. But that is not the goal of the Course. Peace is (T-8.I.1:1-2). And that can be found at any step along the way through the healing practice of forgiveness. Besides perhaps reading the answer to Question 128 again in light of the above comments, it may also be helpful to look at Questions #57, #142, and #229."

    "text_input": "Q #258: I have been trying to forgive a major person in my life for some time now, both prior to starting A Course in Miracles and, with more focus, since beginning it. As a result, there have been times when I seem to have let go of much of my grievance, but then something triggers the hurt, and it all comes raging back again. Sometimes it feels like I'm just lopping off the top of this poisonous weed of grievance, rather than pulling it out by the roots. What advice would you have in such a situation? Should I see forgiveness as a process, or is it an either/or, once and for all decision? And if the latter, how do I finally make it? A: Your metaphor for how you are pulling weeds is an apt one. You're not yet getting to the root of the problem so long as you keep your focus on the other person, for that is playing into what Jesus refers to in the Song of Prayer pamphlet as \"forgiveness-to-destroy\" (S-2.II). The ego's version of forgiveness is to make sin real in someone else and then attempt to \"forgive\" it. As you're finding, this just does not work. But that of course is always the ego's goal--\"Seek, but do not find\" (T-16.V.6:5).",
    "output": "The Course, in contrast, is attempting to lead you towards an experience of true forgiveness in which you recognize that \"what you thought your brother did to you has not occurred\" (W- pII.1:1). In the metaphysical sense, this is true at the level of the actual behavior you are holding against this other person, since we are the dreamer of our dream and we assign the roles to the figures in our dream. But the more practical level to understand Jesus' meaning is to recognize that it is your interpretation of what this other person has done that is the cause of your anger and your grievance, and not what the person actually has done (M-17.4). You are blaming this person at some level for robbing you of your peace, love, joy, security, etc. But no one can deprive us of any of these experiences unless we have first chosen to give them away (T- 4.IV.3:3). So the good news is that we don't have to change what the other person has done, which, of course, we can't do anyway. We only need help with changing our interpretation of what has happened. How do we do that? What most of us are not in touch with is that we carry within our minds a huge burden of unacknowledged guilt that unconsciously controls our interpretations of all our interactions by dictating that we seek and find guilt in everyone but ourselves (T-19.IV-B.i.12). The source of our guilt is the mistaken belief, which we cling to, that we have established a separate individual existence apart from God, at His expense. And the cost to Him has been His total annihilation. Guilt at such a horrendous offense is unimaginable, and so our defense is to project it outside of our minds. Our anger at someone else then is always our attempt to justify seeing the guilt of separation outside of us, thus obscuring the projection we are making (T-6.in.1:2). All of us are trying to do exactly the same thing. We are all walking around with intense guilt, covered over with a seething rage that is our attempt to deny the guilt within and see it outside. We may try to put a nice, socially appropriate face of innocence on all of this (T-31.V.2), but the anger, and the guilt fueling it, are always bubbling just below the surface. And there they will remain, affecting all our interactions, sometimes subtly, sometimes not so subtly, until we are willing to do the challenging and difficult work of looking within, past the anger to the guilt buried beneath it. So forgiveness then really has nothing to do with the other person, which explains in part our resistance to practicing it. For, rather than justifying our anger, if we really want to heal, Jesus is asking us to recognize that our grievances are nothing more than a cover for our guilt. Anger then becomes a signal that there is a dark place within our mind. And Jesus helps us see that our guilt, like our anger, is not what it appears to be. It only seems real and heavy and serious while it remains shrouded in darkness. Its unreality becomes apparent when we allow the light of true forgiveness to shine upon it. This is the release we seek and yet, while we remain identified still with our ego, it is also a cause for fear. We resist looking within, preferring to hold on to our anger and to continue to project our guilt, because these are the layers of defense that we unconsciously see as protecting our individual self (T-21.IV.1-3). And so beneath the anger and the guilt is fear--fear that if we forgive we will disappear, that God will seize back the life we stole from Him. For all these reasons, forgiveness will be a process for us, as you suggest, and not simply a once-and-for-all decision--until the very end of the process, when we are ready to let go completely of our ego identity. The more we are willing to uncover our own guilt and allow it to be healed, the more we will come to recognize that those against whom we have been holding our grievances are only in need of the same release that we have been seeking. And their guilt is no more real than our own. With that recognition, we can experience real forgiveness, for the interpretation of what has happened between us is now the Holy Spirit's and no longer our own. For further discussions of the process of forgiveness, you may wish to look at Questions #44 and #69i."

    "text_input": "Q #259: This question has two parts. The first starts from an observation. As I have been advancing through the workbook, I have often found that the daily lesson corresponds uncannily with a need or preoccupation which has only just begun to make itself felt in my mind--as though some subtle synchronicity were at work between the unfolding Course and my own",
    "output": "changing inner state. (This has also happened on occasions when reading the text). Do you think this is a frequent experience among students of A Course in Miracles? Maybe my first question goes some way to answering my second, but I'll ask it anyway. In the workbook, Jesus frequently tells his student about how he or she is responding at that particular point. For example, in Lesson 123, he says, \"Today let us be thankful....There is no thought of turning back, and no implacable resistance to the truth. A bit of wavering remains, some small objections and a little hesitance ... \" (W-pI.123.1:1,3-4). But how can Jesus make such general pronouncements when referring to thousands of individuals, each with their own way of responding to and progressing with the Course? A: With regard to the first question: Occasionally, we have had students relate experiences similar to the kind you described, but we have no way of knowing how common this type of experience is. Many students have said that when they were reading certain parts of the Course, they felt that Jesus was speaking very personally to them. Second, as we know, most of what is written in the Course was given specifically to Helen Schucman and Bill Thetford for their personal spiritual process, and so the wording reflects that context. Jesus was helping Helen, in particular, with undoing what was left of her ego; so he would include comments, observations, gentle rebukes, emphatic directives, etc., that pertained to her personal process. At the same time, though, the Course can easily be understood as reflecting the more general pattern of spiritual advancement that applies to everyone. An excellent example of this are the six stages in the development of trust described in the manual for teachers (M-4.I.A). This discussion of the development of trust is meant to give us a general sense of what occurs during the process of undoing our ego. It is not surprising that you would experience the kind of synchronicity that you describe. Recall that (a) time is not linear or real; (b) the content of the split mind never changes: the wrong mind is 100% ego-- innumerable ways of expressing the one content of separation and sin, guilt, and fear; the right mind is 100% Holy Spirit--innumerable ways of accepting the Atonement through forgiveness; (c) having acceded to the ego's strategy of making ourselves mindless, we are not aware of the full dimension of the content or dynamics in our minds. And we surely are not aware of the full content of each lesson Jesus gives us. Thus, what we actually experience is almost always just a minuscule portion of what is going on in our minds, and is almost always in a defined form, rather than its original abstract nature--the tip of the iceberg, to switch metaphors. To simplify, as Jesus does, there is \"only one problem, one solution\" (W-pI.80.3:5); and we are either calling out for love or extending love. Therefore, our readiness and openness to learn from Jesus reflects the call for love in our minds, and it has already been answered. We would experience this process as something new that is happening as we read words in the workbook, when all it is is our mind's decision to stop blocking the truth that is always there. It is a perfect match, you might say, between our call for love and the answer to that call, experienced in the only way that would be intelligible to us at that moment. It is a process that happens in our minds outside time and space; but because we are still identified with a body that seems to exist in time and space, that is how we will experience it. Jesus did not know \"ahead of time\" how his students would respond and what they would be ready for at any given instant. To think that is to make time real. The process is experienced in time, because that is the only form in which we (the decision-making part of ours minds) can accept the truth about ourselves. We are still too invested in our identities as separate, special beings, and too frightened to get beyond them. That is quite normal, and as we continue to practice forgiveness, we will be drawn more and more to the love that inspired the words of the Course that are so meaningful to us."

    "text_input": "Q #260: \"The curious belief that there is a part of dying things that may go on apart from what will die, does not proclaim a loving God nor re-establish any grounds for trust. If death is real for anything, there is no life\" (M-27.4:1-2). Please explain the verse. Does the body \"die\" or is that only illusion?",
    "output": "Death is an illusion, but so is birth, aging, and losing vitality, as the beginning of this section states (M-27.1:2). If \"there is no life outside of Heaven\" (T-23.II.19:1), then the body neither lives nor dies. Jesus is really talking about the thought system of death with which we identify when we choose the ego as our teacher instead of him or the Holy Spirit. If we choose the ego, we will believe that the separation from God really happened, and that will lead us to believe that we are bodies that were born and will eventually die. The ego will try to soften the cruelty of its thought system of death by saying that even though we have to die, part of us (our souls) will survive the death of the body. But Jesus is teaching us that there can be no compromise in this at all. \"If death is real for anything, there is no life\" (M-27.4:2). God did not and could not make death, any more than He could make fear. \"Both are equally meaningless to Him\" (M-27.4:9-10). This is a Level One statement. The ego's god is responsible for fear and death. And so Jesus is teaching us that when we identify with the ego (Level Two), death will be a reality for us, and many people will believe that God is merciful because He takes our souls to Heaven after we die. So the process of A Course in Miracles is to ask for help from Jesus or the Holy Spirit to begin to disidentify with that thought system, and to perceive death as just a thought in our minds that we have chosen to make real. \"Ideas leave not their source,\" as Jesus reminds us numerous times throughout his Course. We can gradually begin to get comfortable with the thought that nothing happens to us when the body \"dies,\" because we are decision-making minds outside time and space that have just chosen to believe that we are autonomous bodies, as a defense against the truth that we are the one Son of God, Who never truly left His home in Heaven."

If this is the case, you will have to forgive him before the process is completed, and so he will \"show up\" in one way or another.

    "text_input": "Q #262: Could you please further explain \"Swear not to die, you holy Son of God!\" (T- 29.VI.2:1). Someone told me that it means that we literally don't have to die. We do die, but we don't have to die by the conventional means; we can simply choose to de-materialize. Is this true? Also speaking about death of the body, why do many enlightened beings such as Jesus, Ghandi, Peace Pilgrim, to name a few who have only peace and love in their minds, choose to die violently? I thought what is in the mind will manifest in the world. Wouldn't their death be a peaceful passing? I guess you could argue that they physically didn't feel pain, but as far as an example to others viewing their life, why wouldn't the peace pervade unto their last breath to teach what is within is what happens without, and also to lessen the fear of death to their brothers who want to live as they did. A: In our answer to 87, in which we commented on this passage, we stated that we have already pledged our loyalty to the ego thought system, in which death--including ours--is the central reality. We have already taken this oath to believe that God's Son is not as He created him, invulnerable and eternally present within the Being of His Father. It is part of the bargain we made with the ego, so that our individual separate identities would be preserved. In this passage, therefore, Jesus is asking us to undo that bargain. He is not talking about the physical process of dying. He is talking about our decision to support what the ego says is reality, rather than what the Holy Spirit says is reality. We refer you also to #135, in which we discuss the topic of death in the context of the all- important distinction of form and content, or purpose. We are always choosing at every instant to identify with either the ego's or the Holy Spirit's thought system. And so, in that sense, death is no different from any other thought in our minds. It can be directed by either of those thought systems. It is up to us as to how we shall die: as guided by the ego or by the Holy Spirit. The overriding emphasis in A Course in Miracles is on the mind's decision-making capacity to choose a teacher. Jesus is interested always and only in whether our thinking is blocking his love or accepting it. The form of the body's \"death\" is not relevant to our spiritual progress. The content in our minds is. Focusing on purpose and form and content can also help to answer your question about the death of enlightened beings. Most of the time we do not know the reasons behind people's choices, and we should be very cautious about judging solely on the basis of form, or what we see with our eyes. \"Nothing so blinding as perception of form\" (T-22.III.6:7), Jesus reminds us. What appears to us to be \"violent,\" therefore, may not be experienced by their minds that way. For example, when you experience yourself as having been victimized, you (as a decision-making mind) have interpreted an occurrence in the world; you (as a decision-making mind) have given a meaning to that occurrence or event. Jesus knew he was not his body, and so if nails were hammered through his feet, he would not have experienced himself as a victim of someone else's cruelty. He no longer had an ego, and so he could not experience himself as vulnerable in any way. Moreover, he would have seen the call for love beyond the people's anger. So to say he chose a violent death might be how we would interpret the event, because we have a need to see it that way, but it would not be how he experienced it. He teaches us about this in Chapter 3 \"Atonement without Sacrifice\" (T-3.I) and also in Chapter 6, \"The Message of the Crucifixion\" in which he says:",
    "output": "\"There is a positive interpretation of the crucifixion that is wholly devoid of fear, and therefore wholly benign in what it teaches, if it is properly understood. The crucifixion is nothing more than an extreme example. Its value, like the value of any teaching device, lies solely in the kind of learning it facilitates. It can be, and has been, misunderstood. This is only because the fearful are apt to perceive fearfully ... You are free to perceive yourself as persecuted if you choose. When you do choose to react that way, however, you might remember that I was persecuted as the world judges, and did not share this evaluation for myself\" (T-6.I.1:5; 2:1-4; 5:2-3). Finally, Jesus helps us rise to his level by asking of us: \"Teach not that I died in vain. Teach rather that I did not die by demonstrating that I live in you\" (T-11.VI.7:3-4). The Course helps us to learn that our perceptions are interpretations informed either by the projection of guilt in our wrong minds, or inspired by the love in our right minds."

No one can get in touch with an ancient moment of actual separation from God, because there is no actual separation from God. The only explanation for our seeming existence in the world is that we are dreaming a dream of separation. Even here in the dream the ancient memory is not accessible: \"Time really, then, goes backward to an instant so ancient that it is beyond all memory, and past even the possibility of remembering\" (M-2.4:1). It is a dream in which the choice to make the thought of separation real is being continually relived. In this sense, there is only one thought of separation. Each time we choose to identify with the thought of separation that same original thought is being played out: \"Each day, and every minute in each day, and every instant that each minute holds, you but relive the single instant when the time of terror took the place of love [the choice to believe that the separation is real]\" (T-26.V.13:1-2). One of the most poignant ways to recognize the separation thought in action is to see ourselves insist on being right. The specific forms vary, and do not matter; any insistence in defense of any belief is the result of having taken the thought of separation seriously. It is the ego's tantrum making a declaration of separation in that very moment. It is this thought acted out in the present that we need to get in touch with, so it can be healed. This is what the Course asks us to practice by asking us to \"question every value that [we] hold\" (T-24.in.2:1). Every thought or belief we have has its roots in the thought of separation. The separation is undone as we learn to see it reflected back to us in the \"rightness\" of our judgments, with the willingness to take responsibility for them and question their validity. Doing this will open the way for us to seek and to accept the Holy Spirit's correct interpretation of the separation thought, which is that it is not real, and has had no effect: \"The tiny instant you would keep and make eternal, passed away in Heaven too soon for anything to notice it had come ... not one note in Heaven's song was missed\" (T-26.V.5:1,4)."

    "text_input": "Q #264: A clear picture of the theoretical foundations of A Course in Miracles for me is an essential base to get into practice. Therefore I'm studying the chart on your Web site.  : I see the realms: one-mindedness, wrong-mindedness and right-mindedness. Which realm is the \"decision maker\" in? Does it dwell somewhere between wrong- and right-mindedness? Or do you see it more as a \"part\" of one of these realms?",
    "output": "The decision maker is the part of the mind that chooses to identify with either the ego's thought system or the Holy Spirit's thought system. It is never neutral; it is always choosing one or the other. On the chart it would be located on the Level Two section right in the middle, above the wrong mind / right mind boxes. : It is irritating to see the Holy Spirit between truth and illusion and to see the Holy Spirit in the following description of the Trinity as belonging to one-mindedness. I have more a picture in my mind that sees the Holy Spirit as a part of the illusory world--namely the right-mind-- pointing out of it towards truth-- or perhaps just being this right-minded world--and thus fulfilling a mediating role between wrong-mindedness and one-mindedness. Looking at the Trinity I see God and Christ in the one-minded realm and the Holy Spirit in the right-minded realm. That view makes it possible for the \"me that lives in duality\" to accept the idea that the Holy Spirit is a part of me. These ideas seem to contradict what is shown on the chart. Can you help me in clearing up these thoughts? A: Within the illusion, the Holy Spirit represents the Atonement principle in our right minds. He is described in many ways by Jesus, who shares His function of helping us climb back up the ladder separation led us down. When you, as a decision-making mind outside time and space, choose once and for all to let go of the ego and identify completely with your right mind, then you become the manifestation of the Holy Spirit, the same as Jesus. You would know that this is your only identity and the ego thought system of separation and individuality would be seen as totally meaningless. So the Holy Spirit is most definitely part of you, the part of your mind that contains the memory of God and your true Identity as Christ, with which you (as a decision- making mind) can choose to identify at any given instant. There are two passages in particular that indicate that the Holy Spirit is part of the Trinity and also functions as mediator: \"And then the Voice [the Holy Spirit] is gone, no longer to take form but to return to the eternal formlessness of God\" (C-6.5:8). Similarly, in the text, he tells us: \"The Holy Spirit is the Christ Mind which is aware of the knowledge that lies beyond perception. He came into being with the separation as a protection, inspiring the Atonement principle at the same time. Before that there was no need for healing, for no one was comfortless. The Voice of the Holy Spirit is the Call to Atonement, or the restoration of the integrity of the mind. When the Atonement is complete and the whole Sonship is healed there will be no Call to return. But what God creates is eternal. The Holy Spirit will remain with the Sons of God, to bless their creations and keep them in the light of joy\" (T-5.I.5:1-7). Finally, it is helpful to keep in mind when studying the chart that we are trying to diagram what is illusory (the mind that separated from God), and also what lies totally beyond form (God, Christ, and His creations). So while charts are useful teaching aides, they can never perfectly depict the thought systems discussed in the Course, which themselves are illusory."

    "output": "The picture of Jesus that the Foundation makes available is not meant to be the likeness of the historical Jesus. Obviously no image of him is available. The voice that Helen Schucman heard and identified as Jesus' voice is not associated with a body at all. So in neither case is the Foundation offering an image that can be said to actually portray Jesus in form. The image you refer to was used as the cover of one of the Foundation's publications \"Forgiveness and Jesus\" by Kenneth Wapnick, and was made available to the public by request. The original painting by Howard Chandler Christy was later given to the Foundation. Some people like it, though it is certainly not appealing to everyone. You may find there is another representation of Jesus in form that you find inspiring and helps you to relate to Jesus in a more personal way. However, it is important for students of the Course not to confuse the voice Helen Schucman heard and identified as Jesus', with the Jesus of traditional Christianity, nor to associate it with any particular image in form. The Course uses the term Jesus and the Holy Spirit as symbols reflecting the part of the mind of the Sonship that holds the memory of God. They are not real persons: \"The name of Jesus is the name of one who was a man but saw the face of Christ in all his brothers and remembered God. So he became identified with Christ, a man no longer, but at one with God. The man was an illusion, for he seemed to be a separate being, walking by himself, within a body that appeared to hold his self from Self, as all illusions do\" (C-5.2:1-3). However, as long as we believe we are individuals in bodies, it is helpful for us to relate to these symbols as persons in any specific form that is meaningful. This is what the Course refers to when it tells us: \"You cannot even think of God without a body, or in some form you think you recognize\" (T-18.VIII.1:7). Jesus himself joins with us in our perception of the body: \"Reach, therefore, for my hand because you want to transcend the ego\" (T-8.V.6:8, italics ours)."

    "text_input": "Q #266: What exactly is the script and what part does choice play in it? Are all events fixed because these are lessons we have chosen to learn and the choice is only in seeing everything with the Holy Spirit? Or is there a further choice in which we can actually change the script, i.e., avoid, accelerate, rearrange, omit, reorder, add situations, events, relationships, etc.? And, if the mind has been healed in certain aspects, would it then mean that certain corresponding events in the script would not come up? And would we know it? And does this have anything to do with forgiveness? A: The script (W-pI.158.4:3) refers to all the seeming events that could possibly be played out on the ego's screen--the world of time and space. All these events are fixed in the sense that they are already written. In fact, they have already happened although, A Course in Miracles tells us, in reality they never even happened at all, since the thought of separation and the consequent guilt from which they all originate is itself a fiction. In that instant of separation, everything-- every dream, every possible ego choice--occurred and instantly was corrected by the Holy Spirit. But we who seem still to be caught in time and space have not yet accepted that correction",
    "output": "into our minds and so, as fragmented parts of that one ego mind, continue to project our specific scripts of guilt out onto the world we made as the screen for those projections (M-2.2-4). And so we now seem to have a choice as to which of all the myriad, nearly infinite number of ego events we shall review, although we generally accept certain constraints on our choices once we select a specific identity in a specific lifetime. But there are still many choices on the level of form that can be made in each moment. This range of options (from the fixed pool of possibilities) is all part of the ego's seductiveness, as it tries to persuade us to continue to believe that if we can only choose the right forms in the right combination--the right relationship, the right career, the right place to live, the right investment, the right lottery numbers, etc.--we can be happy. What the ego always attempts to keep hidden is the underlying content of those choices, which must be sin, guilt and fear, based as they all are in the belief in separation and separate interests (T-29.IV.2-3). It is the Holy Spirit's task to teach us that the only really meaningful choice we can make in time is to allow His purpose to guide us in each of our moments of decision, so that we will use them to awaken from the dream rather than to continue dreaming in search of the \"perfect\" ego dream in which all our specialness needs are met. And that means we are willing to release our own judgments about how things should be, which is what it means to practice forgiveness (T- 29.IV.5-6). Generally, in any one lifetime, there is a specific victimization theme that recurs within or across relationships. It may be a theme of betrayal or abandonment or rejection or abuse or neglect, etc. Since each theme represents nothing more than the specific form of projected guilt over our buried self-accusation of how we attacked God in the moment of separation, it must recur in our lives until we are willing to withdraw the projection and heal that aspect of guilt in our own mind, rather than seeing it outside ourselves. And that is what the Course means by forgiveness. Once the guilt behind a specific form of victimization has been uncovered and released, we will no longer need to project it outside our mind. We may or may not be aware of this inner shift as mirrored in our external relationships, although we may at some point have a realization that we are no longer being triggered by external happenings in the way we had been in the past. There would certainly no longer be any ego-based motivation to select such specific victim scripts anymore to hide our guilt. For further related discussions on scripts and choice, you may also wish to review Questions #37, #190, and #233."

    "text_input": "Q #267: I am on Lesson 240 in the workbook of A Course in Miracles. In my words, it says that fear, in any case, is never justified. I am wondering about the people in the jets on September 11th, being aware that they were going to crash against the towers. Couldn't they feel panic or fear, anyway?",
    "output": "Yes, by all means. It would be strange if they did not feel panic or fear. To say that fear is never justified is not the same as saying we should not feel fearful. Similarly, Jesus says that anger is never justified (T-6.I.4), and that we are never justified in perceiving ourselves unfairly treated (T-26.X.3,4). The essence of his gentle teaching is that when we become aware that we are feeling fearful--to stay with your example--we should not try to justify it by attributing the cause to something external, even though that is our experience. As we practice our lessons of forgiveness over a period of many years, we will become more comfortable in acknowledging that fear always comes from ego identification, regardless of what is going on externally. When our minds are healed--when we let go of the ego entirely--we will never experience ourselves as vulnerable or under threat, because we will have perceived the body correctly--as simply the projection of a thought of guilt and fear in our minds. We will know that we are as God created us, and that nothing can alter that Identity. These ideas are also found in Lesson 160, \"I am at home. Fear is the stranger here.\" So when Jesus says in Lesson 240 that \"fear is self-deception,\" he is speaking from the perspective of a healed mind. When we truly know and accept that \"not one thing in this world is true,\" we would never again be afraid or even upset, regardless of the circumstances. This is a slow, gentle process that begins with our simply saying the words we have read in the Course, \"next to be accepted as but partly true, with many reservations. Then to be considered seriously more and more, and finally to be accepted as the truth\" (W-pII.284.1:5-6). Finally, it may be comforting to remember that Helen Schucman experienced intense fear long after she completed the scribing of the Course. One episode in particular led to the sublimely beautiful and instructive prose poem, \"The Gifts of God,\" which appears as the final piece in the collection of her published poetry called The Gifts of God. This poem actually was a special message from Jesus meant to help Helen with her fear. (See Absence from Felicity, pp. 402-404 for a detailed account of the circumstances surrounding this message.) Nowhere in this poem does Jesus tell Helen that she has failed in some way because she is experiencing so much fear. In some of the most inspiring and moving material Helen received from Jesus--which obviously applies to all of us --Jesus helps her to understand the true nature of her fear and how to get beyond it."

    "text_input": "Q #268: I finished reading the text and started the workbook of A Course in Miracles about two weeks ago. I haven't experienced any great resistance that I am aware of and most of the ideas of the Course ring true to me. However, there does not seem to be much apparent progress with my feeling peaceful and not taking the illusion seriously. I suspect I may be accepting A Course in Miracles only on a superficial intellectual level, missing its goal in the mind. Would you recommend anything to me other than proceeding with the exercises and hoping that it will eventually work?",
    "output": "Jesus acknowledges uncertainty such as yours, \"You are very new in the ways of salvation, and think you have lost your way\" (T-17.V.9:1). But he also reassures all of us, \"The outcome is as certain as God\" (T-2.III.3:10). Your uncertainty is not surprising in light of the fact that the Course is attempting to help us unlearn a massive defensive system upon which our complete false identity as an individual physical self with its own unique personality is both based and protected. The fact that you may be willing to hear and accept at an intellectual level what it is teaching does not mean that your mind is totally aligned with putting all of what it says into practice. It would be very unusual, in fact, if you had that total willingness and, if it came that easily for you, you probably would not need the Course. You may not have intellectual resistance to the Course's radical ideas, but you no doubt have resistance to its practical application at a deeper level since you are not yet experiencing the greater peace this path promises. But again, that is not unexpected. So simply be patient with yourself and allow yourself to hear Jesus' message more deeply as you practice his workbook lessons. And recognize that this almost certainly will take time for, as Jesus says at the end of the workbook, \"This course is a beginning, not an end\" (W-ep.1:1). The exercises should help you begin to see the many different forms in which your resistance shows up. Just noticing how much of the day you spend judging and condemning yourself and others can be very helpful in identifying the resistance, as your recognition of the purpose of those separation thoughts deepens, as well as their consequences--the guilt and lack of peace (for example, W-pI.21-23, 26, 34). A key will be that you not simply evaluate the ideas in terms of whether they make sense to you and you accept them, which is a part of the process, but that you consider how they are actually reflected in your thinking as you experience your day. This is one of the goals of the workbook lessons, bringing the Course out of the realm of the theoretical to the level of application (W-in.1). And as you look more deeply, uncovering the buried guilt in your mind, it will be helpful to remember that there is also a loving Presence within your mind--the Course uses the names Jesus and Holy Spirit for this Presence--that you will want to remember to invite to be a part of the looking process. Increasing your awareness of that presence, reflecting a choice for forgiveness rather than judgment, is another very practical purpose of the workbook (see for example, W-pI.30, 41-50). And, perhaps most importantly, do not try to evaluate your progress with the Course--none of us is in a position to do that (T-18.V.1). All the Course asks of us is a little willingness, promising us that if we will do our part, which is simply to look at what we have made real in our minds and its cost, the rest will be provided (T-18.IV). What more could we ask for?"

    "text_input": "Q #269: In reference to #134 about pets being part of the Sonship, since pets, whatever form they take, are incapable of reason, how do they get back to the Oneness of God. Are we responsible for their return?",
    "output": "The question you ask makes sense to us, self-identified as bodies. But the question is based on a faulty premise, that it is the brains in our bodies that understand and reason and decide. It is the collective mind --of which our individual mind is a fragment--outside of time and space that is projecting the figures that we each identify as ourselves within the dream of the world, And that same mind is projecting the figures of the animals, as well as the plants and the rocks, etc. An analogy may help. When you watch a movie, you are looking at one single picture (actually a series of individual pictures in succession, creating the illusion of movement, time and causality on the screen, but that is another subject) projected onto the screen in front of you from the film running through the projector. But your mind separates out figures on the screen and generally focuses on those that may be seen as human and makes the idea of individual bodies real in front of you, even though the total screen image is a single projection. Any figures of animals, or bushes and trees, or furniture, or buildings and other scenery that are also being projected onto the screen are really no different from the figures you identify as human. They are all simply shadows of varying colors and shapes, made by the film blocking the light that is extending from the projector, producing various patterns on the screen that you interpret as real. It is the interpretation that you give your perception of those images that gives them their meaning to you. If you want to make any changes to the figures that are being projected on the screen, the process is always the same. None of the seemingly separate figures on the screen have any more or less power than any others to effect changes on the screen. They are all the effect of what is being decided by the projectionist in the projection booth--it is there that the power of decision rests for what will be seen on the screen. If you are the projectionist in the booth, you can decide on a different film, or you can decide you are no longer interested in the projections on the screen and want to return to your life outside the movie theater. Now it makes no difference which figure you may have been identifying with on the screen--an image of a human, or a dog, or even a rock--when you pull your attention back from the screen to the film and the projector, you realize that it is all one projection. And all the figures that seemed separate and alive on the screen just disappear into the light when they are no longer being projected. The equivalence of all projected forms in the world is reflected in Jesus' observation: \"How holy is the smallest grain of sand, when it is recognized as being part of the completed picture of God's Son!\" (T- 28.IV.9:4). Now there are certainly limits on the analogy, but the point is that no decisions are being made by figures on the screen of the world that we see ourselves in--neither humans nor animals nor plants nor minerals. Thinking we are here on the screen rather than back in the mind is simply a trick we are playing on ourselves to convince ourselves that the separation is real. But the mind, when it no longer wants to project the shadows of guilt out onto the screen of the world, can pull back the projections and allow the light that has always been there in the mind simply to extend. And that is the return to Oneness. And since minds are joined, when we make that decision for ourselves, we make it for the whole Sonship (T-14.III.9:3-5). And the realization is that none of us ever left in reality, and so return has never really been necessary.

    "text_input": "Q #270: The answer to #10 does not feel as right to me as the rest I have read on this site. It says that to answer questions i-iii justifies the ego's existence and I agree. But if you give that answer to this specific question, I believe that answer should then be given to all the questions submitted, and to any question on A Course in Miracles. Just by typing words or acknowledging the Course you are acknowledging the ego's existence, since words and all things of this world never are 100% truthful (or knowledge) and must then be \"not God.\" My point is that everything \"here\" is not valid so why not try to answer this question when other equally invalid questions are being answered. The Course says there is no difference in the magnitude of any beliefs \"here\"--they are all of the same illusion. But the ego seems to get some sort of extra importance which is not to be questioned and answered in the same manner as other parts in the book. My feeling is that the Course simply does not give as clear an answer about the ego's existence as it does to other issues, and it should just be acknowledged that we do not know about the origins of the ego--it is unclear  .",
    "output": "Did your nonexistent ego put you up to that? Very clever! But the Course is very explicit about the ego's origin and existence--it can have no origin because it doesn't exist, it is not real. The Atonement principle, upon which the Course's forgiveness process is based, asserts the unreality of the ego--the thought of separation--in very definite terms. Consider the following: \"The full awareness of the Atonement, then, is the recognition that the separation never occurred. The ego cannot prevail against this because it is an explicit statement that the ego never occurred\" (T-6.II.10:7-8). \"Atonement corrects illusions, not truth. Therefore, it corrects what never was. ... The instant the idea of separation entered the mind of God's Son, in that same instant was God's Answer given. In time this happened very long ago. In reality it never happened at all\" (M-2.2:2-3,6-8; italics added). The Course would not be true to its basic metaphysical principles about what is real and what is illusory if it provided any answer that accepts and affirms the ego's existence. However, from that it does not follow that every answer to any other question addressing aspects of the ego must also be affirming its existence. The key, as the Course emphasizes repeatedly (e.g., T-4.V.5.6:7- 9; T-17.VI.2:1-2), is what is the purpose: does the answer further reinforce a belief in the ego, or does it in some way begin to undo that belief? Clearly, to explain the ego's origins, or even to say its origins are clouded in mystery, would be to affirm its existence. But to explain what a belief in the ego entails and how that belief can be undone through the practice of forgiveness is not an affirmation of the ego's existence. It is simply a very practical way to begin to undo the illusion. Here we find a major contribution of the Course to the world's spiritualities. For it does not ask us to deny our experience of ourselves as separate, but it nevertheless offers us a way out of our conundrum of mistaken beliefs. All of us, by the very fact that we believe we are here, are screaming, \"The ego is real and I am my ego!\" Jesus knows he has to meet us where we believe we are and use what we have made real to show us in the end that none of it is real. If he did not, we could not bridge the gap between false belief and truth on our own. The Course never attempts to change the ego (T-22.V.1:1-6), because it does not acknowledge its existence. But it does attempt to change our belief in the ego. The only thought that does not reinforce belief in the ego is forgiveness. Forgiveness, as noted above, rests on the Atonement principle, which uses the ego's own words to state that the separation, the ego, never happened. And true to its metaphysical underpinnings, the Course makes no claim that forgiveness has any more reality than the ego. In fact, Jesus explicitly includes it within the domain of the illusory: \"Forgiveness might be called a kind of happy fiction; a way in which the unknowing can bridge the gap between their perception and the truth ... they need an illusion of help because they are helpless\" (C-3.2:1; 3:1; italics added). So the whole practice of the Course is never directed at modifying the ego--that would make it real--but rather at stepping back and looking at the ego and all the consequences of believing in it, until we come to recognize that none of it is real. And then the question of where the ego has come from can no longer even be asked. But while we believe it is real, Jesus will gently help us see it all differently."

    "text_input": "Q #271: How can we develop our relationship with Jesus or the Holy Spirit, and perceive them as a reflection of Love, so we can look, with them, at our ego thought system without judgment?",
    "output": "A relationship with the Holy Spirit or Jesus begins with the honest recognition that all our efforts to make ourselves truly happy and to find peace on our own terms have failed. As long as we think we can find our way back home to God by our own devices, we will not truly seek the help of those who represent the memory of Him in our minds. When we are willing to acknowledge our failure, we come to the point where we can say sincerely: \"I do not understand the world, and so to try to lead my life alone must be but foolishness. But there is One Who knows all that is best for me\" (W-pII.242.1:2-3).This is the birth of the relationship with Jesus or the Holy Spirit. They are the symbols of the part of our minds that reflects the memory of God, but because we believe we are separate bodies we perceive them as \"persons\" who are separate from us, and we relate to them accordingly. This is necessary as long as we continue to identify with the body. Since A Course in Miracles comes from the same part of the mind of the Sonship that Jesus and the Holy Spirit represent, studying and applying the Course teaching is also a way in which we relate to Jesus and the Holy Spirit. Our relationship with them develops as we deepen our understanding of the true nature of the ego thought system in all its apparent devastation, and we realize that we cannot embark on its undoing without help. From this acknowledgment comes our cry for help. It comes to us in the form of Jesus or the Holy Spirit reminding us that we are mistaken, and in need of a different way of looking at every situation and relationship we find ourselves in. The effectiveness of the help is commensurate with our willingness to seek and accept their perception. This is what is meant by listening to the Holy Spirit's voice rather than the ego's, and in doing so we practice what the Course asks: \"Resign now as your own teacher\" (T-12.V.8:3). The Course tells us later in the text: \"Remember nothing that you taught yourself, for you were badly taught\" (T-28.I.7:1). It is clear, therefore, that in order for our relationship with Jesus or the Holy Spirit to be meaningful and have results, it must be based on the willingness to unlearn everything we have taught ourselves. This is what we find so difficult, and it is what limits our relationship with Them. Looking at what we have taught ourselves with Them means looking at the beliefs we hold with willingness to first question them, and eventually let them go. Looking with the intent to uncover what was hidden so it can be healed is looking without judgment. We are not asked to do this perfectly; only to do it as best we can. In itself it is loving because it initiates the process of undoing the ego thought system, which is what will lead us back home to God. With this as our goal, Jesus and the Holy Spirit become kind and loving guides on our journey."

    "text_input": "Q #272: As a newcomer to A Course in Miracles, I am sure you have answered this lots of times. When the Course speaks of forgiveness it refers to: (my paraphrase) what you think has happened, has not. No one has ever hurt anyone or done anything terrible. My mind goes on tilt. Are the facts of a past situation just illusions? If there is a clear written pamphlet or paper on the subject, I would appreciate a reference.",
    "output": "Forgiveness, as it is presented in A Course in Miracles, can be understood only within the framework of the metaphysics of non-dualism; otherwise it will make no sense, and its meaning will be distorted and made indistinguishable from the more traditional meanings. It cannot be detached from what the Course teaches is the origin and purpose of the world and our seeming presence in the world as individual bodies with a past, present, and future. The Course's understanding of forgiveness is unique and follows logically from this base, but it is difficult to put into practice because our lives and experience are based on premises that are the opposite of what the Course teaches. In order to \"forgive your brother for what he has not done,\" we must--at least intellectually-- begin to accept that all anger and all feelings of victimization are projections of our own unconscious guilt, which itself comes from a belief that we have sinned by attacking God so that we could have our own individual lives. All of that is illusory, of course; but because we think we are individuals, those premises are still present in our minds. Having made that sinfulness real, and not wanting to give up our individual identities and return to the oneness of God, we then deny the sin and project responsibility for it onto something outside us. Thus, the guilt that we projected is now in others who are perceived as mean, hateful, violent, insensitive, selfish, etc., and we are the innocent victims. The \"we\" in all of this is always the decision-making mind outside time and space, which has been forgotten and replaced in our awareness by a self that seems to exist in time and space. That in barest outline is the origin of our perception and feeling that we or others have been unfairly treated, victimized, etc. There obviously is a lot more to these dynamics, but this at least begins to give you some idea of how the Course's theory of forgiveness evolved. We can see from just this much, though, that the only reason we would experience ourselves as unfairly treated is so that we would be able to say that someone else is guilty. This does not mean that we are to deny the \"facts\" of the external events. The Course is talking exclusively about how we experience them. That is the key. Perceiving yourself as unfairly treated is an interpretation coming from an unconscious need to perceive the situation that way. (#262 discusses this in the context of Jesus' own view of the crucifixion.) We are not aware of those dynamics, but not being aware of them is an integral part of the ego's strategy of projection. The first step in the process of forgiveness, therefore, is reversing the projection and its effects. This means recognizing that what we have attacked and judged in someone else is what we have first condemned in ourselves. It is recognizing that our projected anger is a decision we made to avoid our own guilt by seeing it in someone else. Again, this does not mean denying what someone else has done, nor does it mean that you should not do something about it. The second step entails understanding that the guilt, too, represents a decision, which is now brought back into our awareness and reconsidered. Instead of choosing to identify with the ego's thought system of guilt, we choose instead to identify with the Holy Spirit's thought system of guiltlessness. This paves the way for the third step, which is the work of the Holy Spirit. Thus, the first two steps of forgiveness represent our decision to allow the Holy Spirit to do His healing work within us. But the Holy Spirit can take away our guilt only when we have withdrawn our investment in it. Once our guilt is gone --even for just an instant--we are identified only with love and kindness, and we would not take anything personally. That love and kindness alone would flow through us as we respond behaviorally in the situation, and therefore our response would automatically be what is most loving for all concerned. Behaviorally, it might appear the same as anyone else's response; but the content would be love. In terms of our spiritual progress, that is all that matters. These steps are described in two places in the Course: T-5.VII.6:7,9-11; W-pI.23.5:1-4. Brief summaries and explanations of the Course's approach to forgiveness are found in two of our publications: Forgiveness and Jesus: The Meeting Place of \"A Course in Miracles\" and Christianity, Chapter 2; A Talk Given on \"A Course in Miracles\": An Introduction, Chapter 4: \"Anger-Forgiveness.\" Finally, if you have had a chance to read some of the other questions and answers, you probably have run across several applications of these principles."

    "text_input": "Q #273: In the Bible it speaks of Lucifer the fallen angel. Is that a symbolic expression of our separation from God? When the Bible speaks of hell is that also another symbolic expression of our living in this nightmare on earth that we think is real?",
    "output": "Neither the Bible, nor traditional Christianity, refers to Lucifer or hell as a symbols. In Biblical terms Lucifer was the leader of the angels who refused submission to God, and hell is viewed as an actual place of punishment where those who reject God are doomed to an eternity in God's absence. The teaching of the Bible is based on beliefs that are not similar to the principles of A Course in Miracles. Since the Course teaches that the separation never really happened (T-6.II.10), it follows that it cannot have any symbolic expression. The separation is a thought in the mind of the Sonship of something that could never occur in reality. It becomes a \"reality\" in our awareness when we choose to take it seriously and to believe it is real. Guilt over this choice is then projected out of the mind in the form of the physical universe, which is made to keep God out: \"Thus the world was meant to be a place where God could enter not, and where His Son could be apart from Him\" (W-pII.3.2:4). Since hell is defined as the absence of God, the world becomes hell in our experience; not a symbolic expression of it. The Course is very clear that God cannot be found in this world of form. However, when an individual chooses to identify with the part of the mind that holds the memory of God, the world becomes a reflection of that choice, and is no longer perceived as hell: \"The world becomes a place of joy, abundance, charity and endless giving. It is now so like to Heaven that it quickly is transformed into the light that it reflects\" (W-pII.249.1:5-6). The important distinction for students of the Course to make is that because separation from God is not possible, there is no hell, there are no \"fallen angels,\" nor a world where God can enter not. The sick mind that believes in separation makes them real; the healed mind knows they are not."

    "text_input": "Q #274: Do you think that, in the view of A Course in Miracles, there could be a point in some scripts where suicide would be considered in keeping with the \"gentle laying aside of the body\" when use for it is done?",
    "output": "It seems unlikely that suicide would be the means for the \"quiet choice\" (S-3.II.2:1) for death when \"the end has come for usefulness of body functioning\" (S-3.II.1:10), if by suicide you mean deliberately directing an action against the body for the purpose of causing its apparent death. If the \"choice\" represents the simple recognition of the end of the body's purpose in the world of form, the body would simply no longer seem to be infused with \"life\" and a whole variety of so-called natural or accidental causes could be seen in the world's view as the cause of the death. But any action seemingly taken by the body against itself for the purpose of intentionally bringing about its death would only serve to reinforce the belief that the body is real and is a cause and not an effect, not only in the mind of the individual committing the suicide, but also in the minds of others learning of the suicide. This is not likely to be a helpful lesson for anyone. Furthermore, if the one committing suicide has any sense of the death as an escape from physical or emotional limitations and problems, there would remain lessons unlearned in the mind that would still need to be addressed in another lifetime, since limitations never originate in the body or in the world. Now it is also true according to the Course that everything that seems to happen to us, including our seeming death, is chosen by the mind (e.g., T-21.II.2:3-5; W-pI.152.1). And each decision may be directed by either the ego or the Holy Spirit, either to reinforce guilt or to help undo it through the relinquishment of judgment and attack thoughts. And so there may be circumstances in which a choice for suicide could reflect a right-minded decision--although it would not be the simple laying aside of the body when its usefulness is over. Suicide is after all simply another form of magic intended to change the dream and take away pain, similar in content if not form to taking aspirin to get rid of a headache. So, for example, one who still believes in the reality of the body and its pain, who is racked with a physically devastating illness, might choose, without judgment or guilt, to commit suicide in order to escape the apparent pain of the disease-ridden body. It is not the final lesson that could have been learned, but there is no sin in choosing to postpone the lesson when the fear level is too high, which the intense physical pain would reflect. And if the suicide were done with the recognition that it is not God's Will that we suffer and that death is not final, the experience could reflect further steps along the Atonement path. Purpose, after all, is all that ever matters in every choice we make (T-4.V.6:7-9). See also #135 for a much more in-depth discussion of suicide from the perspective of A Course in Miracles."

    "text_input": "Q #275: I am struggling with the exact meaning of the verb \"to extend\" in A Course in Miracles. I learn in the Glossary-Index and on page 114 of the text that the laws of mind in the world are different from the laws of mind in the Kingdom: the mind of the world projects and perceives and cannot go beyond this, while the Mind of spirit only extends. Since I am from a non-English- speaking culture, I am struggling to understand what seems to be a very fundamental concept. I would really appreciate your help. A: As you may have noticed in the Glossary-Index, to extend, or extension, has two levels of meaning in the Course. At the level of knowledge--the oneness and totality of Heaven or the Kingdom, which the Course says is our only reality--extension is synonymous with creation (e.g., T-11.I.3:4-5; T-14.V.3:4). But the meaning of neither of these words is comprehensible to our finite minds, since they refer to a totally abstract activity or process of Mind/spirit that has nothing to do with time or space or bodies--all illusory dimensions of the physical world made by the false ego mind. In Heaven, we are God's extensions or creations, and like Him, we can extend or create. But even this statement cannot be taken literally, for it suggests that we and",
    "output": "God are separate, that He has somehow brought us into being as an entity separate from Him. Because our non-dualistic reality is one, unified, perfect and eternal, extension of that reality cannot involve adding more to it or increasing it in any way that our limited minds would understand (W-pI.105.4:2-5). And so there is little more to be said about the meaning of extension at this level that would be helpful. The Course's other meaning of extension refers to the level of perception, the level of the illusory, dualistic, split mind. The meaning is still somewhat abstract, but a little more comprehensible than at the completely abstract level of knowledge or Heaven. Our experience in the world of time and space and separate bodies is based on the law of mind that governs all thought at this level, the inevitable dynamic that leads us to perceive outside of ourselves the content within our minds that we have chosen to see as real. And there are only two contents to choose between within the split mind: the ego's guilt or the Holy Spirit's forgiveness. We see outside ourselves whatever content we have chosen within. If we have chosen the Holy Spirit as the guide for our thoughts, the Course refers to the process as extension. If the ego is our guide, the process is called projection. The ego seeks to use the dynamic of projection to place the guilt outside of our minds and then to deny its origin in our minds. In other words, rather than seeing the guilt outside us as an extension of the same guilt in our minds-- which it is--the ego wants us to believe that we can literally project the guilt outside of our minds so that it is now separate from us, thereby supposedly regaining for us the innocence we believe we lost with the thought of separation. And for this defense to work, we have to forget that we projected the guilt from our own mind. Of course, this is not how mind works, for denial does not alter the fact that the mind is indeed the source and \"ideas leave not their source\" (T-26.VII.4:7-9). The Holy Spirit's goal, in contrast, is to teach us to recognize the correspondence between what we perceive outside and what content we have chosen in our mind so that we can make an informed choice about what we will extend or project until our split mind is healed. The ego desperately attempts to hide this dynamic from us, for the success of its projection depends on our failing to recognize that we project or extend only our own thoughts (W-pI.30.2). And the ego's strategy is very successful most of the time, for our anger and judgment reflect our belief that the outside world is indeed independent of us. So the Holy Spirit seeks to reinforce our awareness of the continuity between within and without as a result of extension, while the ego always seeks to deny the source in our mind and assert that what we see outside of ourselves-- guilt--exists separate from and independent of us. The Course's purpose is to help us see that the choice of what we extend or project is ours alone--each with its own consequences for our peace of mind."

    "text_input": "Q #276: I belong to a group that meets weekly to study A Course in Miracles. It is essentially a leaderless group, in that we meet at each others' homes, and the host(ess) sets the form and tone of the meeting. Overall, there is an agreement that we will study the Course, and that to understand and practice it is our purpose. However, over the years, it has regularly happened that someone will bring up the ideas put forth elsewhere. Sometimes these thoughts are brought up, discussed, etc., and we're back to the main theme again. Other times, the meeting gets quite sidetracked and the theme becomes decidedly un-Course-like. What to do then? Sometimes one of us will make a comment to get things back on track, and that works fine, but sometimes that  comment is clumsy, and others don't make any indication that they support it. Other times no one says anything at all. We have tried, over the years, to make a better definition of our purpose, but our egos have a field day with that, and we have really argued with each other, and at one point part of us split off and formed another group. So, the question I think is, \"How can I practice the loving lessons of the Course, when I'm still in the process of learning those lessons?\" I will appreciate your comments.",
    "output": "Readiness does not mean mastery, Jesus tells us (T-2.VII.7). You simply practice as best you can; then review what happened, bring your mistakes to the love of Jesus, and ask his help to forgive yourself for not being perfect. There actually is no more effective way to learn this Course. The willingness to apply whatever you have learned is all that counts in the end, not how well you applied it. The ego would be thrilled if you put the practice of the Course on hold until you thought you had learned everything. Jesus, on the other hand, just asks that we turn to him and ask his help every step of the way, without judging ourselves. The essence of the process is learning how to trust, and identify with, his loving presence in our minds. He asks us to \"trust implicitly your willingness, whatever else may enter. Concentrate only on this, and be not disturbed that shadows surround it. That is why you came. If you could come without them you would not need the holy instant. Come to it not in arrogance, assuming that you must achieve the state its coming brings with it\" (T-18.IV.2:3-7). There is nothing in the Course about how to conduct group study, and it is not essential to be part of a group in order to learn and practice the Course. If you want to be in a group, however, it can be an excellent opportunity to practice what you have learned about special relationships and the authority problem. You can be there with the Holy Spirit or Jesus guiding you, in which case you would be learning how to perceive your interests as the same as everyone else's, despite the differences in form and behavior. Or you can be there with the ego, in which case you would be reinforcing the ego's view that your interests conflict with others' interests and that the differences among you are serious and meaningful. It is no different than any other special relationship in that sense. You may choose to leave the group and form another one with the ego guiding you--which will result in condemnation, resentment, frustration, specialness, etc., or with the Holy Spirit or Jesus guiding you--which will result in your being peaceful, and without judgment of yourself or anyone else."

    "text_input": "Q #277: The following answer combines responses to two different but related questions:  Since one person's life has many relationship connections, when something devastating happens to that person, many family members' and friends' lives are affected. So whose projection of guilt caused this, since many experienced the outcome? Is it everyone's in their life projections or just the person directly involved with the devastating experience? Also, with something like the attack on the World Trade Center, is everyone in the world responsible for this projection of guilt? When A Course in Miracles students, including myself, go to a Course student I know to counsel with him about our problems and dramas, he tells each of us that we are the only one here. I know that there is only one Son of God, but which one is he? It seems confusing that I should think I'm the only one here and yet others also think they're the only ones here. So am I in your dream or are you in mine and who is affecting whom?",
    "output": "All events in the world reflect a level of joint decision to experience them among the seemingly separate minds that are apparently affected. But the interpretation of any event in each individual mind is what determines the nature of the experience for that mind. Two individuals can go through the same external event together and one can feel victimized and the other remain at peace because of how they choose to see the event in relationship to themselves, and perhaps, more to the point, how they view themselves. If guilt is real in the mind, external events will be taken personally. If guilt has been released, events can be observed without any personal reaction. This is true whether we are speaking of minor events involving just two people or major world events, such as the attacks of September 11th or the recent war in Iraq. All that is important in any situation is my own reaction to the events I am experiencing. For this reason, it can be very helpful to eliminate anyone else from the equation and realize I need only be concerned about my own interpretation of what is going on. The one Son of God is not anyone in the world, but the one mind that seems to have fallen asleep and fragmented into billions of seemingly separate, individual dreamers. When you are analyzing one of your night dreams, you are not concerned with what was going on in the minds of the other figures in your dream, for they all simply reflect different aspects of your own mind--you're the only one here, but it's your mind that is the only one here, not your body. And here is not in the world, but in an illusory state of separation. As all of this becomes clearer in your mind, dealing with the so- called events of the world becomes increasingly simple, for the only solution is to turn to the Teacher of peace within, leaving the teacher of separation and guilt behind. For additional discussion of some of the issues related to joint decision-making in the dream and the levels at which choices are being made, see #37 and #233."

    "text_input": "Q #278: It has been said that the ego is not real, it is a mouse roaring like a lion, it is just our belief in it that gives it power. So why then when we decide to change our teacher to the Holy Spirit, has it been said the ego becomes vicious? This makes it sound like its an entity that is striking back, like it has a life of its own. Once we change our mind, why does it not render the ego gone? How can the ego become any more vicious than it already is? This makes me confused as to how much power the ego really does have and makes me a little afraid of it getting back at me for wanting to ignore it. A: The ego is the thought of separation. Though it is not real, it is a thought that is both weak and powerful. It is weak because it is a thought of separation from God that could never happen, and what can never happen has no effect. Yet, it is powerful because belief in it keeps us rooted in hell with love blocked from our awareness, and our minds darkened by guilt. Attachment to our identity with the ego thought system is very strong, which is why the decision to identify with the Holy Spirit is perceived as a threat and causes us to become fearful. It is this fear that motivates attack, as the Course tells us: \" ... frightened people can be vicious\" (T-3.I.4:2, italics ours). Since it is nothing in itself, the ego does not actually become vicious, it does not do anything: \" ... the whole separation fallacy lies in the belief that the ego has the power to do anything. The ego is fearful to you because you believe this. Yet the truth is very simple: All power is of God. What is not of Him has no power to do anything\" (T-11.V.3:3-7). We cannot do anything worse than what we have already done by taking the thought of separation seriously, thus denying the truth about our Self.",
    "output": "When we choose the Holy Spirit the ego is gone, because we cannot hold two mutually exclusive thoughts in our minds at the same time. The part of the mind that identifies with the ego realizes that if identity with the Holy Spirit is chosen permanently, belief in the separation is no longer possible, and the separated self disappears. Being unwilling to allow the disappearance of the self, the separation thought is chosen once again in the insane belief that it will have a different outcome--that happiness will be found in separation and specialness. There is nothing more painful or more vicious in our experience than the repeated choice for separation. It is important to remember that this is a choice we make. It is not something that the ego does to us. We are not asked to ignore the ego or this choice; we are asked to look at it and uncover all the ego's schemes. Only by looking will we become aware of our responsibility for choosing to believe the ego's lies, and realize the price we pay for this choice. The Course tells us this is the source of all pain: \"The cause of pain is separation, not the body, which is only its effect\" (T- 28.III.5:1). Although it is a death blow to the ego and may be perceived as painful, choosing the Holy Spirit, whose thought system undoes the separation, is the only way out of pain. When the confusion you mention comes upon you it may be helpful to consider this beautiful reminder from Jesus: \"Ours is simply the journey back to God Who is our home. Whenever fear intrudes anywhere along the road to peace, it is because the ego has attempted to join the journey with us and cannot do so. Sensing defeat and angered by it, the ego regards itself as rejected and becomes retaliative. You are invulnerable to its retaliation because I am with you\" (T-8.V.5:4-7)."

    "text_input": "Q #279: I know that, as A Course in Miracles says, all illness is a defense against truth. Are you aware of any case of someone who, after many years of continuous study and practice of the Course, started to feel an abstract fear of this apparent reality, like losing his mind-- agoraphobic-like symptoms?",
    "output": "It is not surprising that fear may appear to become more intense as we work with the Course over time. We are after all in the process of removing all the many defenses we have constructed to minimize fear in our awareness and to disguise it as other seemingly more manageable feelings, such as anger or excitement. Jesus is well aware that our fear will seem to increase over time as we study and apply his Course: \"You have not yet gone back far enough, and that is why you become so fearful. As you approach the Beginning, you feel the fear of the destruction of your thought system upon you as if it were the fear of death. There is no death, but there is a belief in death\" (T-3.VII.5:9-11). And later in the text: \"As the light comes nearer you will rush to darkness, shrinking from the truth, sometimes retreating to the lesser forms of fear, and sometimes to stark terror\" (T-18.III.2:1). The form that our increased fear may take will in most cases keep our focus on the external world and on threat to the body's life and well-being, since that is the identity as egos we are trying to maintain. Agoraphobia is certainly a specific form in which the fear could be expressed, as the experience of oneness that the Course is leading us towards is one of no limits or boundaries--the ultimate spaciousness, if you will. No matter what form the fear takes, the answer is always the same. All fear ultimately comes from the belief that we have attacked and destroyed love and that we will be attacked and destroyed in return. If we can quiet our minds just enough to ask for help, joining with the presence of love that has remained always there despite our beliefs, we will know that love cannot be destroyed, and so neither the guilt of attack nor the punishment we have believed it calls for are true. In the words that conclude the introduction to the text, \"Nothing real can be threatened. Nothing unreal exists. Herein lies the peace of God\" (T-in.2:2-4). You do not say whether this is simply a theoretical question you are asking or whether you are describing your own or someone else's actual experience. If the latter is the case, should the symptoms persist and continue to be unsettling and problematic, it is always a wise course of action to see a professional therapist for help in alleviating the symptoms."

    "output": "It depends on what you mean by denying. If you mean that you are aware that they are there and that you (as the decision maker) are responsible for them, but then you deny their power to take away your peace or change your reality as God's Son, then you are using denial in a helpful, positive way. Then you would be denying the error, or denying the denial of truth (T-12.II.1:5). The mistake we all made was to take the \"tiny, mad idea\" of separation seriously, instead of smiling at the silliness and insanity of believing that we could exist as separate individuals apart from God (T-27.VIII.6). We repeat this mistake every time we judge our ego thoughts to be so awful and so bothersome that we need to repress them or escape from them. We correct that mistake every time we look squarely at our ego thoughts, and remember that the only power they have is the power we give to them by our belief that they define us and that they can truly affect us. So that we don't skip steps, then, we first must deny their seeming power. And we can do that most effectively by looking at them with the love of Jesus next to us. As that love becomes more and more real to us, our ego thoughts will become less and less real to us. And then one day we will simply regard them as meaningless, as we will have finally accepted the love of Jesus as the only reality in our minds."

    "text_input": "Q #281: My question pertains to responsibility. I understand that I am responsible for what I think, and that by choosing to agree with the ego, I am making the world real.

This makes them feel responsible for their errors without recognizing that, by accepting this responsibility, they are reacting irresponsibly.\" Please clarify.  Secondly, regarding making the world ... I understand making the world real, or the mistake real, but literally making the physical world is difficult to wrap my head around experientially. If I am upset at some other car hitting my car in an accident, am I responsible for making it real by getting upset, or am I responsible for making the accident happen so I would have something to blame my anger on. To clarify, do I go out and find an excuse to be upset, or do I literally make the excuse happen. Did I cause that car to hit my car, or am I just using this occurrence as an excuse to be upset instead of choosing to be at peace looking at the whole accident with the Holy Spirit.",
    "output": "In order to understand responsibility as meant in A Course in Miracles, it is essential that you first understand just who it is that the Course is addressing. It is never the self we believe we are, living in the world, that Jesus is speaking to. That self has no power to do anything, for it is only the effect of thoughts in the mind. And it is to the mind that the Course is addressed. It is just this distinction that Jesus is making early in the text when, in the context of our learning to heal our perception and ultimately come to realize that \"all perception is unnecessary,\" he observes: \"You may ask how this is possible as long as you appear to be living in this world. That is a reasonable question. You must be careful, however, that you really understand it. Who is the 'you' who are living in this world?\" (T-4.II.11:3,5-8; italics added). Since, as the Course states repeatedly in Lesson 132, \"there is no world\" (W-pI.132.5:1; 6:2; 7:1; 10:3; 13:1), there can be no \"you\" that is living in this world. There is only mind in which the seeming world is contained. We have an experience of this when we awaken from a sleeping dream and recognize that a complete world seemed to exist in which we moved about and acted, yet both the world and the self we thought we were while we slept both remained completely within the dreaming mind. To understand the Course's teaching on responsibility then, it is important to allow a shift in our perception of who this responsible self is--mind, not body. We may understand this only intellectually at first, but it is helpful to be willing at least to begin there. And so, to consider the Course lines you quote: In this particular paragraph, Jesus is using the word responsible in the ego's sense of guilty. We believe that we really can think apart from God and order our thoughts independently of Him, and then we assume responsibility, or blame, for having done that, never calling into question the reality of our belief that we can separate ourselves from God. And on our own, apart from God's Help, there is no escape from the awful burden of this responsibility, because we cannot question its reality on our own. And so to accept responsibility for sin is to buy the ego's lies, thereby acting irresponsibly. Jesus is not asking us to deny that it is our own decision that brings about this experience of guilt (T-5.V.8:1), but he does not want us to associate blame or guilt with that choice or we will not believe it can be undone. As for how we could possibly have made the world and everything that seems to happen in it, remember that it is not the self you think you are but the mind of the Son, which we are all a part of, that is responsible for falling asleep and dreaming of a world of separation. Again, that the mind has the power to make up a world is apparent from our sleeping dreams (T-18.II.5). Still, this is usually not the most helpful perspective from which to consider the events of our lives, including such things as car \"accidents.\" To focus on how we are choosing the events of our lives is usually not helpful because the choice is far from conscious awareness for most of us most of the time, and such a focus is more likely to induce feelings of responsibility in the ego's sense of guilt or blame. The more helpful and healing perspective is to recognize that it is our interpretation of the events of our lives that we always have a choice about, in every moment. And while events can not be undone, interpretations of those events can be undone in an instant, if we so choose. We never become upset at external circumstances, but rather make the choice for separation and guilt in the mind first and then look for something external to which we can attribute our upset. This serves to keep ourselves mindless and beyond the hope of any real solution to our loss of peace. The self we think we are in the world is never the cause of anything, so it becomes irrelevant to ask whether we choose the events of our lives, so long as we see ourselves as \"living in this world.\" The only helpful choice to be in touch with is our choice of how to interpret what we believe is happening to us. The ego's interpretation is always that we are victims, and not responsible for how we feel. The Holy Spirit, in contrast, says all events in our lives are the opportunities for learning to make a different choice--releasing guilt and fear rather than reinforcing them. For additional discussion of some of the issues related to joint decision-making in the dream and the levels at which choices are being made, see Questions #37, #233, and #277."

I am considering taking up robes and becoming a Buddhist nun, in order to further my spiritual understanding.

So whether you are in a monastery or in a corporate office makes no difference from that point of view. What makes a difference, spiritually, is whether you see your interests as different from everyone else's or as the same. The Course encourages us to see our life circumstances and settings as classrooms in which we can choose to learn either the ego's curriculum, which is based on separation, or the Holy Spirit's curriculum, which is based on the undoing of separation. It teaches us to think always in terms of purpose: Are we using the world and our relationships to reinforce our belief in separation or to undo it? The world and the body, thus, are not the problem; the way we use them is the problem. And that always is the result of the choice we make in our minds to be taught by the ego or by Jesus. Thus, what would be most helpful in your situation is to ask for help in undoing any specialness that might be involved in the decision you are making. That would go a long way toward removing the doubts and conflicts you experience."

It doesn't matter that yesterday I was practically sitting at the right hand of God when today I'm a hateful, spiteful, blankety-blank! So, we start where we are. As you stated, you know your ailments come from your guilt. This recognition alone gives you more knowledge than 99.9% of the population. You are off to a good start right there! You want to lose weight to live a longer and healthier life, and as an aside, to perhaps feel better about your looks as well (although you didn't say so). You have a plan, which seems complete and well thought out. You imply that you have implemented your plan, at least for a little while, and then you became confused--about your plan, about your guilt, etc. Sounds like you made a right-minded decision to take better care of yourself, to love yourself a little more, to \"let go\" of some of your guilt, and to be worthy of good health and happiness. It also sounds like once you started implementing your plan, a tiny voice began to whisper in your ear--the content of its message, no matter what the words, being \"who will I be without my guilt?\" Once heard, you began to get confused. Should I? Would I? Could I? All of this a direct response to your right-minded decision. This is a perfect example of what we all do in various aspects of our lives. We make right- minded decisions, become afraid of them (and their implications) and jump right back into the arms of the ego until we tire of its insanity and begin the entire process again--over, and over, and over. We continue this way until our fear is totally diminished and we make the final right- minded choice, at which point we are in the real world, and the tiny voice of the ego is heard no more. And, if you can generalize this process to your entire life, you'll be able to more quickly and easily recognize signs of fear as they creep into your thoughts, no matter what form they take. This will help you take your doubt and self-sabotage less seriously than you have in the past, simply stating: \"Of course, I've gotten afraid again. So what else is new?\""

    "text_input": "Q #284: I have been a police officer for over six years. Since joining the police force, I have become interested in various spiritual teachings, including hatha yoga and A Course in Miracles. As a result, a few years ago, I decided to resign from my police job and try to find a job more in line with living a spiritual lifestyle. The police work seemed to become more difficult as I tried to come more and more from a place of love and non-judgment. I felt as if I was becoming too vulnerable for that type of intense work.  But then I returned to the police job after taking about a year off, having concluded that I could not run away from my projections because they followed me wherever I went. Only the form changed. I went back to the police force for about two years before again feeling a strong desire to leave. I am currently on a leave of absence from my job, studying to become a certified Yoga teacher. I have almost finished the program and must make a decision on what to do next. I have thought a lot about becoming a monk in the Vedanta order since this seems to me to be the closest to what I believe to be the Truth, but I think this might just be another escape mechanism. I have continued to study the Course along with Yoga, even though in many ways these two practices seem contradictory, since Yoga focuses on using the body as a means to cultivate stillness. My main question is, from a Course perspective, is police work a more difficult path to walk while trying to wake up, since it involves dealing so often with very intense situations and seeing egos at their worst? Is this conducive to practicing forgiveness? What about monastic life? Since the Course's focus is on forgiving relationships, it might not agree with monastic life, i.e., renouncing the world. If I could only be willing to hear the voice of Jesus or the Holy Spirit and  stop confusing myself. It's a bummer to have the awareness that I am doing this to myself, but not enough willingness to stop doing it.",
    "output": "Although you say you have one main question, it would appear that you really have two distinct, but nevertheless interrelated questions. And the prior question is to which spiritual path, Yoga or the Course, do you want to commit yourself? You recognize that they are not the same, but if you attempt to maintain a foot on each path, as they diverge more and more in your experience over time, you will feel increasingly split and confused. So this is the first question you may wish to answer, at which point an answer to the second question--what line of work or career should you choose--may be more readily apparent. Although the deeper metaphysical teachings of the Course and the Vedanta--both assert the non-dualistic nature of reality--are the same, the means to remembering that reality and awakening are different. Jesus, addressing the student who has made a commitment to the Course, points out how the Course differs from other paths: \"Nor is a lifetime of contemplation and long periods of meditation aimed at detachment from the body necessary. All such attempts will ultimately succeed because of their purpose. Yet the means are tedious and very time consuming, for all of them look to the future for release from a state of present unworthiness and inadequacy. Your way will be different, not in purpose but in means. A holy relationship is a means of saving time. One instant spent together with your brother restores the universe to both of you\" (T-18.VII.4:9-11; 5:1-3). In other words, the Course's process to awaken is forgiveness--not meditation--practiced in the context of all of our relationships in the world. Some relationships are more intense than others, but all provide opportunities to heal our projections of the guilt we have sought to place outside our minds, by withdrawing those projections and seeing them within, where they can then be released. And so which path you wish to pursue is the first decision you may want to address. The Course makes no claim to being the only way--\"There are many thousands of other forms, all with the same outcome\" (M-1.4:2). The only basis for decision is listening to your own inner teacher and becoming clearer with which path you really resonate. Should you decide that Yoga is your path, the choice to become a monk and renounce the world may then be the next step. Should you on the other hand decide that the Course is your path to awakening, you may look at your choice about work differently. Police work is no doubt very challenging and for this reason provides tremendous opportunities to practice forgiveness, as you increasingly recognize that any reactions or feelings of vulnerability you experience are only projections of your own thoughts. But the Course would never insist that only one line of work or only certain specific relationships will afford you those learning opportunities. As you said, your projections will follow you wherever you go. So relax. Perhaps you can find some comfort in the fact that the confusion you feel is not over which line of work to pursue. That is only ever a distraction from your real choice, since salvation does not depend on anything that happens in time, but only on what happens in your mind, outside of time and space. Choosing between the ego and the Holy Spirit, between reinforcing guilt or accepting healing and forgiveness, is the only choice that ever really matters. Even if it is simply resistance to your lessons of forgiveness that is impelling you to turn away from police work, the most important thing would be to get in touch with the resistance, not to force yourself to stay in the job. Once you are clear what your goal is, the rest will follow (T-17.VI). For if your goal is forgiveness, everything can be seen to serve that end. And then you can simply sigh a huge sigh of relief, for you don't really have to figure anything else out! For some relevant previous answers, you may wish to look at Questions #90 and #141."

    "text_input": "Q #285: Sometimes when I ask the inner voice (Holy Spirit) to guide me, I think I get an answer and later I find out it was the ego who answered disguised as inner voice. How can I know when it is the real inner voice that is answering and not the ego?",
    "output": "The answer to your question lies in another question: What is it you truly seek, and of whom? Much of our asking comes with hidden beliefs, goals, and desires, that we are not aware of. We are thereby seeking to make our bodies and the world real, and the ego responds enthusiastically. We can be sure the ego has answered because the response never truly satisfies our perceived need, much less our real need. In the situation you refer to, it is quite likely that the ego answered because the ego was asked. This is nothing to be upset about or afraid of. It is just that we are more deeply identified with the ego thought system than we think. As A Course in Miracles tells us: \"You retain thousands of little scraps of fear that prevent the Holy One from entering ... I wait in love and not in impatience, you will surely ask me truly. I will come in response to a single unequivocal call\" (T-4.III.7:2,9,10). The very important words in this passage are \"truly\" and \"unequivocal.\" This means being clear, unhindered by diverse interests, unambiguous. As long as we believe in our identity as bodies, and believe that our problems are all the situations in the world that need to be resolved, we will ask with a hidden agenda, seeking something specific to allay our sense of lack, meet some need, or make life in the world more \"heavenly.\" Even our requests for the peace of God often hide our desire for happiness on our own terms. If the Holy Spirit were to respond to these requests, He would be reinforcing our belief in the separation. The Holy Spirit's guidance is always on the level of content and not form. His goal is to teach that our only problem is the separation, and the only solution is undoing the thought of separation. If, in our imperfect asking, we are willing to join with the Holy Spirit's goal, we will be able to make decisions in this world, while recognizing the \"scraps of fear\" and ego interests we retain. We can learn that although decisions have to be made, our salvation does not rest on these decisions. This opens us to the Holy Spirit's perception, and thus His guidance, without reinforcing our mistaken belief that the world and the body are the problem. Your question is discussed in Forgiveness and Jesus by Kenneth Wapnick. It is posed in yet another way: \"The crucial question, however, should not be 'How do I know when I am hearing the Holy Spirit?' but 'Why don't I do what He tells me to do so that I can hear His Voice better?'\" (Part III, \"The Test for Truth,\" p. 318). We are still unwilling to do what He tells us to do, and are still afraid of His guidance. If we were not it would be blazingly clear to us. While we are still afraid we do need to ask for help in seeing the hidden beliefs we hold on to in our perceived needs. Undoing our belief in the ego's thought system takes patient practice. Meanwhile, our less than perfect asking is a preparation for the time when we will want only the Holy Spirit's answer. The truth is we have called and He has answered. It is our fear of this that impedes our hearing. His answer for now is to show us the fear that keeps us clinging to our insane belief in the separation, the body, and the world. When we are ready to let them go we will know, and we will hear only His Voice: \"His is the Voice that calls you back to where you were before and will be again. It is possible even in this world to hear only that Voice and no other. It takes effort and great willingness to learn. It is the final lesson that I learned, and God's Sons are as equal as learners as they are as Sons\" (T-5.II.3:8-11). This will come when we are convinced that our only problem is the thought of separation, and the only answer is the Holy Spirit's correction, which is undoing the belief in the separation."

    "text_input": "Q #286: \"There are no accidents in salvation.\" I am puzzled by two apparently contradictory perspectives on this:  : Anything in the world of form can be used by the Holy Spirit as a means for salvation, i.e., I can use any circumstance or event to practice forgiveness. So, in the flow of events--which could be random and meaningless in themselves--I can use anything for the purpose of self- transformation.  : The Holy Spirit provides me with particular events so that I can learn specific lessons. This would suggest that the Holy Spirit makes at least certain aspects of the world: a view which appears to contradict the notion that the ego alone makes forms.  It is my impression that commentators on A Course in Miracles do not favor option number two. Yet this seems to be implied in the quote. Please comment.",
    "output": "In answering your question, it is helpful to realize that even in the illusory split mind, of which the world is only a shadowy projection, neither the ego nor the Holy Spirit does anything. And so neither is responsible for the forms that our lives may take and the events that seem to happen to us. Although the Course's separation myth personifies them as if they were separate entities acting independently, the ego and the Holy Spirit only represent alternative interpretations or symbolic thoughts within our mind about the tiny, mad idea of separation from God. It is the sleeping mind of the Son that gives form to the thoughts in his mind, using either the ego or the Holy Spirit as his guide for choosing and then interpreting those seemingly externalized forms. A few passages from the Course itself may help make the passive nature of both the Holy Spirit and the ego clearer. Early in the text, Jesus says: \"The Holy Spirit is one way of choosing ... The Voice of the Holy Spirit does not command, because It is incapable of arrogance. It does not demand, because It does not seek control. It does not overcome, because It does not attack. It merely reminds. It is compelling only because of what It reminds you of. It brings to your mind the other way, remaining quiet even in the midst of the turmoil you may make\" (T-5.II.6:7; 7:1-6; italics added). In the next section, Jesus observes that \"the ego is the symbol of separation, just as the Holy Spirit is the symbol of peace\" (T-5.III.9:4). The symbolic nature of the ego is described again later in the text when Jesus notes that \"all that the ego is, is an idea that it is possible that things could happen to the Son of God without his will\" (T-21.II.6:4; italics added). That the ego has no power in and of itself to do anything is apparent from this early passage in the text: \"Only your allegiance to it gives the ego any power over you. I have spoken of the ego as if it were a separate thing, acting on its own. This was necessary to persuade you that you cannot dismiss it lightly, and must realize how much of your thinking is ego-directed ... The ego is nothing more than a part of your belief about yourself\" (T-4.VI.1:2-4,6). So when the Course asserts that \"there are no accidents in salvation\" (M-3.1:6), it means that everything reflects a choice--our own! Our sleeping mind makes all the decisions about what to experience and how to interpret those experiences. The \"flow of events\" is never \"random and meaningless\" because all things are chosen by us to serve either the ego's purpose of separation and guilt or the Holy Spirit's purpose of forgiveness and peace. Among the many passages in the Course that speak of the power of our minds, consider just the following two: \"Your holy mind establishes everything that happens to you. Every response you make to everything you perceive is up to you, because your mind determines your perception of it\" (T- 10.in.2:6,7). \"It is impossible the Son of God be merely driven by events outside of him. It is impossible that happenings that come to him were not his choice. His power of decision is the determiner of every situation in which he seems to find himself by chance or accident. No accident nor chance is possible within the universe as God created it, outside of which is nothing\" (T-21.II.3:1-4). And so, while we may initially choose--almost always unconsciously, out of our awareness--an experience to reinforce our perception of ourselves as victims of a world over which we have no control, once the choice has been made we can make another choice and ask for the Help within to see our circumstances differently. And so we begin to learn that we are never the victim of the world we see (W-pI.31) and that no one and nothing else-- neither the ego nor the Holy Spirit nor Jesus nor God Himself--intervenes within the dream we call our lives. For we alone are the rulers of our universe (W-pII.253). For further discussion on the power of decision, you may also wish to review #281. As to whether God or the Holy Spirit intervene in the world and our lives, you may want to look at #235. And on the Course's metaphoric or mythical use of language, see #72."

    "text_input": "Q #287: One section in the text of A Course in Miracles that is of particular interest to me is \"The Last Unanswered Question\" (T-21.VII). Could you comment on the meaning of this section?",
    "output": "The main theme of this section is the power of our minds to choose--ultimately, against the ego. Paragraph 7 makes it abundantly clear that this is a course about changing our minds not the world. It is a course in cause (the choices we make in our minds), not effect (behavior). Jesus explains that when we experience ourselves as powerless or helpless, we are giving witness to our denial of our true identity as a Son of God, who could never be powerless. Once this dissociation has been effected, the authentic power of our minds then is feared as the \"enemy,\" and an \"army of the powerless\" arises to do battle with this mortal threat. Jesus, of course, is describing the battleground in our minds, of which we are not aware because of the ego dynamic of denial and projection. Hatred seethes within us, but is always attributed to some form of evil without, which we then feel justified in attacking and destroying. Jesus is also referring to the ultimate futility and silliness of the seemingly powerful armies in the world. We must perpetuate this system in order to ward off an even worse fate, which is to acknowledge that there is no enemy outside, and that we made ourselves powerless by choosing to believe in the thought system of separation and sin. Reason would tell us that, if only we were to choose to consult it (consult our right minds). The three questions stated in paragraph 5 have to do with our choice to exist in this world in which we seem to be the innocent victims of forces beyond our control. Our feeling powerless to do anything about the conditions in our lives is purposeful. It keeps us from ever experiencing the true power of our minds to make another choice and deny our denial of the truth. Hence, the fourth question--the last unanswered question--is: \"Do I want to see what I denied because it is the truth?\" (T-21.VII.5:14). When we answer in the affirmative to the first three questions, we are saying that we have changed our minds and we really do not want to be victims of the world anymore. But the last question has us confront our decision for guilt and the reason we uphold it. Unless we reverse that decision for guilt, we will continue to deny the presence of love, and we will continually project that guilt. In addition to saying that our lack of peace or happiness is not the world's fault--it is our own fault--we must realize that the guilt within us is a deliberate choice to deny the truth of the Atonement and then choose against it. Until we make that choice, we will vacillate all the time. To answer yes to the last question \"must mean 'not no'\"; it is to decide that I no longer want to be who I think I am: separate, unique, autonomous, independent, free, and special. I no longer want to see myself as distinct from the Love of God."

    "text_input": "Q #288: What is a miracle? Although they are carefully described, I am still wondering what they are. Do they resemble what we commonly think of as miracles? Do we know when they occur, or do they happen constantly without us being aware of them? Can you give any examples of miracles?",
    "output": "First, a miracle has nothing to do with anything external. Miracles pertain only to what is going on in our own minds. In that sense, they are not at all what traditional religious systems have thought of as miracles. Traditionally, conditions in the body and the world have been viewed as the problem; and therefore miracles, simply put, were viewed as the healing or removal of those conditions, usually through some kind of divine or supernatural intervention. A Course in Miracles, on the other hand, teaches that the body and the world are projections of thoughts in our minds: \"It [the world] is the witness to your state of mind, the outside picture of an inward condition ... Therefore, seek not to change the world, but choose to change your mind about the world\" (T-21.in.1:5,7). Now, if you could really accept that the world is merely a projection of a thought of sin and guilt in your mind, you would realize that trying to alter things in the world or the body is ultimately futile, and that changing your mind about the reality of sin and guilt is truly healing. That is why the workbook states: \"A miracle is a correction. It does not create, nor really change at all. It merely looks on devastation, and reminds the mind that what it sees is false\" (W-pII.13.1-3). The miracle corrects our thinking, not a condition in the world or the body. Yet this passage also implies that we are not to blithely dismiss our perceptions of the world either. Rather, we are to look at the devastation in our lives, or the world-at-large, and bring that perception to the loving presence of Jesus in our minds. There, in our choosing to join with that reflection of truth, we will remember that what we are perceiving is but the content of a dream, not reality. \"The miracle establishes you dream a dream, and that its content is not true\" (T-28.II.7:1). Once we are joined with the reflection of truth in our minds, we would be guided solely by that in responding to the situations in our lives. This takes a lot of practice, which is why we have a workbook with 365 lessons, at the end of which Jesus tells us that we are just at the beginning stages of this process of thought-reversal. The entire Course is about this. Our thinking right now is the reverse of what the truth is. What we are so used to calling causes are really effects. A miracle occurs when we remember and accept--for just an instant--that the cause of our and others' lack of peace, sickness, deprivation, etc., is not something of the body or the world, but rather a choice we are making in our minds to identify with the thought system of separation and sin, guilt, and fear. \"The miracle is the first step in giving back to cause the function of causation, not effect\" (T-28.II.9:3). A miracle occurs when we do not take another's attack personally, recognizing instead that we all share the same needs and goals; we all share the same insanity of the ego, and we all share the same sanity of Christ's vision. Sometimes we are not aware of having made that shift in our minds, sometimes we are. Miracles occur as frequently as our willingness allows them to."

    "output": "The main point of \"I need do nothing\" is to help us change the pattern of our thinking. Practically all of the time, we think we know what our problems are, and then we just go about trying to solve them on our own. We define both the problem and the solution. We tell the Holy Spirit how to help us. Jesus is helping us to retrain our minds so that we will more consistently remember that all of our problems in the world and our bodies are made up by our decision- making minds in order to keep our attention away from the \"real\" problem, which is our choice to have the ego be our teacher instead of Jesus. We cannot make this shift if we do not stop and ask for help to perceive ourselves and our lives differently. Therefore, \"I need do nothing\" because there is no problem that needs attention. However, the point is not to be inactive, but rather to shift the purpose of everything we do from the ego's to the Holy Spirit's purpose. We want to train ourselves to think about the new purpose for our lives, which is to learn how to perceive our interests as the same as everyone else's--to concentrate on the content, not the form of what we do. Our interactions with one another provide many opportunities to practice this, and they reflect back to us whether we have chosen to undo separation or to reinforce it. So withdrawing from interactions and activities is not usually helpful. It may be that you would have to stay away from specific people or groups for a while, just as a person involved with substance abuse might have to make behavioral changes at first. So \"to do nothing\" also means to do nothing on your own. Don't automatically assume that your perception of your problems is correct. When you identify with the reflection of truth in your right mind, you might still be very active in the world, but you would not experience yourself as the one who is acting. The love that is in your right mind would flow through you as the source of all you do, and you would experience everyone as the same, both on the level of the ego and on the level of the Atonement."

    "text_input": "Q #291: My question is on differences between A Course in Miracles and The Pathwork, a series of lectures channeled by Eva Pierrakos from a spiritual entity referred to as the Guide. I've been trying to apply the Pathwork teachings to my life for five years. The Guide's teachings, I believe, emphasize too much the importance of accepting ourselves exactly as we are--not perfect. He says we are here (on Earth) to try to improve ourselves but we should never deny the fact that we are not perfect. In other words, accepting this fact is the first step on the way to become perfect. The Guide says that trying to identify ourselves with God without facing (or accepting) our shortcomings means to fool ourselves. If we want to get lost in God we must find ourselves first. These teachings have helped me know myself better but I don't think I have become a better person so far. The Guide also mentions reincarnation in almost all his lectures. But when I found A Course in Miracles I became very confused and disappointed that the Jesus of the Course states that there is no reincarnation. Not because I wanted reincarnation to exist but because Jesus is denying something which the Guide speaks of so naturally, so sincerely, with such a wisdom, that I find it almost impossible not to believe in him. I think the same about Jesus (of the Course) but their teachings about reincarnation are exactly the opposite. I believe that truth is truth. How can I trust in Jesus or in the Guide if one of them is not speaking the truth?",
    "output": "Before addressing either of your concerns, it may be helpful to clarify what Jesus in the Course means when he speaks of the truth. There are really two levels of meaning of the truth that are important to understand if you are going to make sense of the Course. At the highest level of the teaching, Jesus asserts in the Course quite unequivocally that the thought of separation, as well as anything that follows from that thought, including the world of time, space and form, is illusory. Only the formless, unlimited Love of God is real and true. And Jesus means this quite literally. But while this is ultimately true, Jesus also knows that this is not our experience, and so he speaks of what is true at a different, more practical level. Basically, any interpretation of any aspect of the world of time and space that helps us to practice forgiveness is true, while any interpretation that keeps us feeling guilty and fearful is false. Once we believe we are separate, individual selves, the issues that concern us, although ultimately illusory, are very real in our experience and need to be addressed in ways that are helpful to our healing. Almost all other spiritual teachings only address concerns at the level of our experience in the world and do not make the ultimate distinction that Jesus does between what is real and what is illusory. They represent different paths from the Course, and it can become quite confusing to attempt to integrate their teachings with Jesus' teachings in the Course. At the level of form and concepts, spiritual paths may be different from and even contradict each other, but the only real truth is God, toward which all genuine spiritualities are leading, regardless of the specific forms and concepts they employ to lead one back. So let's consider your second concern first--about the difference between the Course and The Pathwork on reincarnation-- since that seems to have the more disturbing implications for you. \"In the ultimate sense,\" as we have just discussed, Jesus does say in the manual for teachers that \"reincarnation is impossible\" (M-24.1:1), because it is a time-based phenomenon, and the Course says time is illusory. But if you read this same section in the manual carefully, you will see that Jesus does not deny the validity and usefulness of the concept of reincarnation at the level of our experience within time and space. That he does not simply dismiss it as untrue should be apparent from his other comments here. For example, in the same paragraph, in speaking of how the concept of reincarnation may be helpful, he observes that \"if it is used to strengthen the recognition of the eternal nature of life, it is helpful indeed\" (M-24.1:6). But he also cautions that it can misused to foster \"preoccupation and perhaps pride in the past\" and \"inertia in the present\" (M-24.1:8-10). Later in the same section, Jesus also counsels against getting involved with unnecessary controversy around the concept (M-24.3-4). But perhaps most helpful to resolve your personal conflict about Jesus' position on the concept is the explicit question he raises and addresses towards the end of the section: \"Does this mean that the teacher of God should not believe in reincarnation himself, or discuss it with others who do? The answer is, certainly not! If he does believe in reincarnation, it would be a mistake for him to renounce the belief unless his internal Teacher so advised. And this is most unlikely\" (M-24.5:1-4; italics added). So on the level of our experience in the world, Jesus and the Pathwork Guide may not be in such terrible disagreement about reincarnation as you have supposed. It is just that Jesus in the Course is attempting to lead us ultimately to a level that transcends any concern with linear time and individual lives. And it is because of this goal that many students have resistance to his teachings and continue to find it so difficult to practice forgiveness. But along the way, Jesus will use whatever concepts have meaning and significance for us in order to help us find our way back home. And so his focus with reincarnation, as already alluded to, is on how we use it to go beyond the body and this lifetime and not simply as a tool for exploring aspects of ourselves in relationship to other lifetimes. Now to your initial concern about what you felt is the Pathwork's overemphasis on accepting ourselves as imperfect. In many ways, the Course's focus is similar and many students express a similar dissatisfaction with its emphasis on the ego--it repeatedly encourages us to identify the negatives of the ego in our minds so that, with the Holy Spirit's help, they can be undone and released. The Course does say that we are already perfect--as Christ-- but not as the ego selves we think we are. And so while we are not here to improve ourselves and become perfect, Jesus is asking us to uncover all the ways in which we continue to insist that our imperfections are real-- the sin, guilt and fear that we have made very real, first in our minds, and then in our world and our lives, to prove that the illusory thought of separation is in fact real. In Jesus' own words from his Course, \"Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all of the barriers within yourself that you have built against it. It is not necessary to seek for what is true, but it is necessary to seek for what is false\" (T-16.IV.6:1-2). For further discussion of the Course's perspective on reincarnation, you may wish to review Questions #24 and #153."

    "text_input": "Q #292: What does A Course in Miracles say about loneliness? I have been feeling lonely very often in my life. Even in love relationships. I felt lonely as a child in my family and still do feel lonely very often in other family-like systems. How could I change my mind about feeling lonely?",
    "output": "The Course describes loneliness as an inevitable outcome of the thought of separation (T- 13.III.12:1; M-10:6:1-2,6). Jesus adds emphasis to this causal relationship by describing God, as well as His Son, as lonely as a result of the separation--in four different passages (T-2.III.5:11- 12; T-4.VII.6:7; T-7.VII.10:5-7; T-15.VIII.3:2). Obviously, Jesus is using poetic license--his purpose being to provide an alternative view of God's reaction to the thought of separation, in contrast to the ego's fearful assertion that God is angry because we left Him (see #136 for more on this point). For God is unchanged by our insane thoughts and remains forever One and undivided. If we are honest with ourselves, all of us who truly believe we exist in the separated state of individuality, limited by and contained within our bodies, and isolated from everyone else, must feel lonely. For who could not feel he is apart from love and not experience loneliness? In the words of the Course, \"As long as you perceive the body as your reality, so long will you perceive yourself as lonely and deprived\" (T-15.XI.5:1). The ego insists that we can overcome our loneliness through the companionship of other bodies. But the joining we seek through physical proximity and intimacy in our special relationships can at best only dispel the painful feelings of isolation temporarily, for bodies can not really join, and the ego's real but hidden agenda is always to reinforce our belief in our guilt (T-15.VII.12). For seeking to be with others to take away our loneliness only gives support to the ego's lie that the separation is indeed real and that the body is our reality. For most of us, most of the time, the resulting loneliness is too excruciating, and so we seek to cover it over through denial, employing various distractions to keep us mindless. But we never question its premise--the reality of the separation. It is only through raising that question that the only solution to our loneliness can be found (W- pI.41.1-2; W-pII.223.1). And the answer is found through experiencing the joining of minds, not bodies. Then we learn that we are not really separate, for that joining is always available to us. Jesus, in the following very comforting passage, reminds us that he is always with us, and so loneliness cannot be real: \"I am come as a light into a world that does deny itself everything. It does this simply by dissociating [separating] itself from everything. It is therefore an illusion of isolation, maintained by fear of the same loneliness that is its illusion. I said that I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. That is why I am the light of the world. If I am with you in the loneliness of the world, the loneliness is gone. You cannot maintain the illusion of loneliness if you are not alone\" (T-8.IV.2:1-7). Now we may doubt that the solution could be so simple, but Jesus assures us that it is. However, that does not mean that it is easy. Yet as we become more willing to see that our interests are not separate from our brothers and to release each of our judgments against both ourselves and others, Jesus and the love that he represents will become more real in our minds, and we will come to experience the truth of his words."

    "text_input": "Q #293: In the text of A Course in Miracles it says: \"Once you accept His purpose as the only one that you would fulfill, there is nothing else the Holy Spirit will not arrange for you without your effort...\"; and in another place: \"Leave all your needs to the Holy Spirit. He will supply them with no emphasis at all upon them\"; and in the manual: \"All the help you can accept will be provided, and not one need you have will not be met.\" I have been struggling to understand this in the context of the world in which I cannot make clients call, students sign up for workshops, or books to sell, yet need greater income. The challenge is in needing to \"do nothing\" in Course language, leave my needs to the Holy Spirit, and trust that \"just\" by forgiveness and a willingness to be at peace, my bills will be paid, particularly when I am surrounded by hundreds of people who slave for 40 hours a week or more. Am I copping out to just let the Holy Spirit take care of my needs, send me clients or sell my books, while I meditate and be happy? A: There are other spiritual paths that teach and advocate that approach, but that is not what the Course teaches, even though the words you quoted, if taken literally, seem to mean that. The key idea is to concentrate on the content, not the form. The content is that there is a loving, caring, comforting presence in our minds, not the punitive Divine Judge religions have taught us about, nor a Merlin-the-magician type presence conferring miracles on those he deems worthy. At the end of the clarification of terms in the section on the Holy Spirit, Jesus helps us take a step beyond that--as he does in dozens of other places in the Course--by teaching us to distinguish between form and content, experience and reality, and symbol and reality: \"He seems to be a Guide through a far country, for you need that form of help. He seems to be whatever meets the needs you think you have. But He is not deceived when you perceive your self entrapped in needs you do not have. It is from these He would deliver you. It is from these that He would make you safe\" (C-6.4:6-10). It is a question, then, of defining ourselves and our needs, and we will always be misled and entrapped if our starting point is that we truly exist as bodies in a physical world. However, if we remember that our seeming bodily life is a false identity having the purpose of concealing our true Identity as spirit, then our needs will be defined differently. We will recognize that our only real need is to awaken from the dream of separation and reunite with our true Self in Heaven, and that all the help we need to do that is already present within us. Forgiveness, then, becomes our only meaningful function while we still believe we are here (T-25.VI.5:3); and the only meaningful prayer we could ever utter would be for forgiveness, because, as Jesus tells us, \"those who have been forgiven have everything\" (T-3.V.6:3). So to accept the Holy Spirit's purpose means to see every aspect of your life as a classroom in which you can learn to identify what you are doing to block your awareness of love's presence, and then ask help of your Teacher to make another choice. Sharing His purpose, you would deal",
    "output": "with the details and obligations of your life responsibly, while at the same time learning that the peace of God within you cannot be affected by anything that is going on externally. Attending to the details of our daily lives affords us endless opportunities to get beyond the form of our lives and to learn that we all share the same interests; we all share the same ego thought system and its correction in our right minds. This is our special function, and because of the way we have set up our lives, it is the most effective way of undoing the thought system of separation in our minds that is the ultimate cause of all our misery and unhappiness. To ask the Holy Spirit to fix what is wrong in our physical/psychological lives is to abdicate our responsibility for our unhappiness and thereby deprive ourselves of the only means we have of ever undoing our mistake and reuniting with the glorious Self of Christ that we all are. The sections in The Song of Prayer pamphlet might give you additional help, especially the first one, \"True Prayer.\" Also, we have addressed similar issues in Questions #72, #116, #259, and #266."

    "text_input": "Q #294: At some point do you see an elementary version of A Course in Miracles coming out? I would like to see children be able to read this Course, since being so young, they have less baggage to release. And children grasp ideas easier and have a clearer, purer understanding of things. Since this is a life-long course, why not start early learning the truth?",
    "output": "It's a common ego trap to fall into the thinking that this Course could be or should be for someone other than myself, whether it's a spouse, friends, politicians, children, etc. The trap is that it distracts me from simply applying its principles of forgiveness to myself and to all my relationships. If I do my part in the plan, releasing all my judgments, everything else will follow in whatever way is most helpful. But the plan is not of my own making, and even my best intentions to help others in their healing is really a subtle--and sometimes not so subtle--ego ploy for seizing control of the plan and putting myself in charge, thinking I know what needs to happen. You are making a few assumptions about children that would not be consistent with the Course's metaphysical teachings. All of us, adult and child alike, share the same ego thought system. A child's mind is no purer than an adult's and no less burdened with the baggage of sin and guilt. The only difference is in the expression in form, not in the underlying content. So the Course would attribute the same full-blown ego to an infant, a child, a teenager and an adult. Each developmental stage simply expresses the ego's underlying content in a different way--generally more disguised and covertly as we \"grow up\" and are socialized to restrain our ego impulses. But the guilt that underlies the form is always the same until we are at a point where we begin to recognize that the world and all that it offers is not really anything we truly want. Usually, although not necessarily, this realization comes only with age and with disillusioning experience after disillusioning experience, as the world fails us in our expectations and we feel repeatedly victimized by forces outside of our control and want another way of being in the world. The Course process is one of looking at all the judgments and hatred in our mind that we project out onto the world to keep ourselves mindless, accompanied by a willingness to release them to the light of forgiveness that interprets all those external situations differently. And the judgment and hate have their origins in the mind, before any individual life has begun, and not in our experiences in the world, no matter how much the world and our individual experience seem to insist to the contrary. Once we have done our part in getting ourselves out of the way, then we are available to be an instrument of forgiveness for all those other confused minds that see themselves as if they were at various stages in the process of human development. When you speak of a more \"elementary version of the Course,\" I assume you mean a version that minimizes the Course's more abstract metaphysical principles. But a teaching that does not use the Course's metaphysical foundation as an explicit and integral part of its message would no longer be the Course. There are many spiritual paths that may lend themselves to the kind of simplification you speak of, but the Course is not one of them. It is written very deliberately in the form that it is because it is intended for adults. Adults can best teach it to children by demonstrating its principles through how they live their lives and raise their children, without ever necessarily even mentioning any of its principles."

    "text_input": "Q #295: My question concerns being there for family members and friends when they are attached to victimhood and ailments (a judgment, I know). I think I understand what true empathy is: to comfort on the level they are, not to speak to them of Course teachings, but also not to reinforce their pain by validating it and making it real. For some family members, illness equals attention ... What is the stance of A Course in Miracles on distancing ourselves from family and friends who are clearly not a supportive, positive influence on our lives? What do we do when they are in so much pain and so miserable and so attached to victimhood that they think it's everybody else's responsibility but theirs to change that? I'm stuck, please help. A: One thing that might help you get unstuck is to try to get beyond the specifics and see that you share the very same ego that your friends and family do, but that you also all share the same right mind as well. Perhaps you express your wrong-minded thoughts in a different form; but the content is identical. They resort to a specific form of magic to ease their inner pain, but you would use a different form of magic. In view of that, your response to them would reflect how you must be responding to your own ego. You would be learning either that the ego is repulsive and has power to block love and peace, or that it is nothing but a \"tiny, mad idea\" having no power to change our reality as the invulnerable Son of God, and therefore it is deserving only of a gentle smile. If you could get beyond the form of their complaints just for an instant--\"Nothing so blinding as perception of form\" (T-22.III.6:7)--you would hear their call for help and know that it is an echo of your own call for help. And then if you clearly knew that that call has already been answered with love, your ego would be out of the way, and you would just naturally--and effortlessly--do whatever is best for all concerned. There is no way of knowing ahead of time what that would be specifically, but it would just flow through you, and you would experience it as not coming from you. It might be that you would be guided to stay home and not visit, or to go and assist in some way. But you would take nothing personally. You would have no investment in their changing or being appreciative of your help; and you would feel energized, not drained and drenched with negativity afterward. Whenever you feel drained you have become personally involved-- identifying with victimization--and more than likely have crossed over into sacrifice, which is always of the ego, because it expresses separation and a one-or-the-other attitude. If there is conflict within you, then the message you are giving is that they are right about themselves, thus confirming their worst fears.",
    "output": "And finally, in that holy instant in which you are joined with the love of Jesus, you would not fall into the ego trap of thinking some illusions are more serious than others; you would clearly recognize that all illusions are the same in content. The ideal that Jesus, our model and teacher, holds out to us is to be able to regard everything as either a call for love or an expression of love. If you could do that for your family and your friends, you would be doing it for yourself. The Course teaches us in many different ways that giving and receiving are the same. This takes a great deal of practice and a great deal of patience and gentleness with yourself, because it is a complete reversal of our usual thinking and behavior. But if you believed that each interaction had the potential to bring you closer to being one with the love of Jesus, you would approach them enthusiastically, not with dread. Do the best you can knowing that, in the end, your success in this is guaranteed. If you make a mistake, it doesn't matter; Jesus will help you correct it later. For further study, you could look at the subsection \"The Function of the Teacher of God\" in the manual for teachers, under section 5, \"How Is Healing Accomplished?\" (M-5.III)."

From what I know of ACIM, Jesus got there. Are there any other generally known people who have crossed to the real world?",
    "output": "When you have crossed the bridge into the real world, you will simply know, without doubt or question. Until such time, you go back and forth between the wrong-mind and the right-mind. That is why it may sometimes feel as if you are there, and sometimes not. And no, you cannot get stuck halfway across. However, you can certainly procrastinate, which may feel like being \"stuck.\" Regarding other people having crossed into the real world, it is almost impossible to tell on this level. Our guilt determines what we \"see,\" so unless we are guilt-free, we would not recognize, with certainty, someone in the real world. Imagine being a witness to the crucifixion of Jesus, watching him go through the situation, and \"seeing\" him did so without pain, suffering, anger, or attack. Undoubtedly there were very few, if any, who \"saw\" the event in this way, because their guilt demanded they see it as has been written in the various gospel accounts.

For instance, if I walk down the street and see a stranger who for a moment looks in my eyes and there is a sudden feeling of \"real\" connection am I to tell myself that this thought means nothing? Isn't this a moment of true reality? I'm confused.",
    "output": "First, the early part of the workbook is primarily about helping us undo our wrong-minded thoughts, which is not to say that we do not have right-minded thoughts. The focus, though, is mostly on our wrong-minded thoughts. The thrust of these early lessons is to have us understand that there is an inner world and an outer world, and that the outer world is the projection of the inner world. Jesus is helping us begin the process of learning that we are not who we think we are, and reality is not what we think it is. He does not want us to settle for anything less than our true inheritance as God's Son. Thus, he says in Lesson 4 that our \"good\" thoughts are \"but shadows of what lies beyond, and shadows make sight difficult.\" Our \"real thoughts\" are being covered by both our \"good\" and \"bad\" thoughts. The shadow would become meaningless if we were to value only that of which it is the shadow; and that is where Jesus is leading us. You do not describe that \"feeling of 'real' connection\" in any detail, nor do you say anything about what followed the experience. Speaking in general, then, that feeling could be of the ego (specialness) or of the Holy Spirit (we are all one). As a right-minded \"connection,\" it would be a shadow of your real thoughts, which have nothing to do with this world or this body. In the holy instant when we no longer perceive separation, we experience a reflection of true reality, but true reality is only of Heaven. Again, that is where Jesus is leading us. Why would we want a reflection or a shadow, when we can have the reality itself?"

    "output": "Lilies traditionally are associated with Easter--the time of resurrection and awakening. And as white, they have symbolized purity and innocence.

Is this a kind of process reversing our life, leading us out, undoing and healing of what has led us into the ego-experience? Can one damage or destroy this process and entirely return back to the ego or another ego? Does one recognize the end?",
    "output": "These are questions that many students think about. It is helpful to remember that we are always involved in undoing something that never really occurred, and therefore the journey on which Jesus is leading us will conclude in our acceptance of that. So even though he maps out a strategy with various steps and stages, he knows that all of it is totally illusory. The happy dreams spoken of in the Course refer to the experience in our minds of no longer being identified with the world and bodies; we would be identified with the Holy Spirit's correction of our mistaken thoughts and choices. We would take nothing seriously in our personal lives or in the world, in the sense that we would know that our peace could never be affected by anything external. We would know--experientially-- that there is no reality other than the love of Jesus in our minds, which would then be the source of all that we do. In that respect, we would be at the end of the process of reversing our choice to be separate, thereby undoing and healing what led us into the ego experience. In that state, we would not be vacillating anymore, which means there is no wrong mind, nor even a decision-making part of the mind. We revert to an ego state only when we still value separate interests over shared interests. It is always a question of what we truly want and whether we are willing to pay the price of being separate. Our true Self is never affected by our choice to deny that Identity and instead be a self in the world, but we will be paying a heavy price to take on and maintain that false identity. Jesus helps us see that our lives are a result of a choice and that it has been a costly one--to us."

But in doing this I am attacking the germs (who made him sick, so he believes). Attacks are never justified. Sometimes it seems to me that joining with one person (the patient) means attacking someone else (the germs). What then can I do?",
    "output": "A good question, suggesting that you desire to consider fully the implications of separate vs. shared interests, not merely limiting your focus to homo sapiens. And to add to the apparent dilemma, consider that with every breath we take, we are inhaling untold numbers of microorganisms to certain death. And that with each hand-washing or shower, whether we aggressively use antibacterial soap or not, we are inflicting large-scale slaughter on uncountable numbers of tiny organisms that apparently just happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. And of course, to keep ourselves alive with food and drink, innumerable lives have to be sacrificed daily in the vegetable and animal kingdom. The way of the world is death, and murder seems to be unavoidable. The world of form has been made from the belief in conflict in the mind, giving apparent reality to the principle of \"one or the other.\" At the level of form, bodies and the world, conflict is unavoidable, despite our best intentions to eliminate or minimize it. That is why A Course in Miracles invites our focus to be on purpose or content and not form. When we act from an ego-based orientation that sees separate interests, our purpose is always attack--regardless of our overt behavior--which always reinforces the guilt in our minds. When we shift to the Holy Spirit's perspective of shared interests, joining with the Sonship as a whole becomes our purpose, regardless of the actions we seem to be taking. And that is why Jesus asks us to join with him in our minds (e.g., T-14.V.9; T-15.III.11; T-15.VI.6:10; 7:1,2,5,6)--before we seek to join with our brothers whom we still see as bodies--whatever form of life they may seem to be. On our own, we always join from a belief that we are separate, while joining with Jesus in our minds helps us develop the recognition that we have never been separate--a statement that can only make sense on the level of mind and ideas. Jesus knows what we believe, but he also knows that everything we believe we see is all made up and that death and destruction are not real. And so Jesus teaches us that we need to change our minds, not our behavior (T-2.VI.3). With that shift from the ego to Jesus as our teacher, we will know that nothing that is real is ever affected by changes in the inconstant world of bodies, including death. And thus the guilt we have been holding onto over our belief in separation diminishes over time, allowing each of us to be an increasingly clear channel of forgiveness for the mind of the Sonship as a whole, encompassing all the seeming fragments that we have experienced as individual \"living\" entities."

    "text_input": "Q #301: What does it mean to give something a name? Could you explain why one then gets power over it?",
    "output": "To give something a name is to establish its identity. It is a way of bestowing \"reality\" on someone or something. In other words, if I determine who you are, I make that definition of you real in my mind, which means I make you who you are. That is the power of giving something a name. It is the nature of the separation to name everything and everyone, herein lies the power of naming: \"You have made up names for everything you see. Each one becomes a separate entity, identified by its own name. By this you carve it out of unity. By this you designate its special attributes, and set it off from other things by emphasizing space surrounding it. This space you lay between all things to which you give a different name; all happenings in terms of place and time; all bodies which are greeted by a name\" (W-pI.184.1:2-6). This is the ego's misuse of creative power. Naming things and people in this way is actually denying their true identity. It is a way of saying: \"You are who I say you are, not who God says you are.\" A Course in Miracles tells us that whatever names the ego uses to identify all things it makes, unless they are seen in the light of truth they remain nameless. One of the most important goals we have as students of the Course is to allow our definition of ourselves to be undone. We have all given ourselves the same name: \"sinner.\" When we are willing to question this, and recognize that we do not know who we are, we realize that we do not know our name. As we let go of all the names we call ourselves, and ask the Holy Spirit to teach us who we are, along with everyone and everything in the dream, we will become open to accepting that it is God's creative power that establishes our identity. We are who He says we are, and so we have another name: \"God's innocent Son.\" His Name is the Name we share: \"A father gives his son his name, and thus identifies the son with him. His brothers share his name, and thus are they united in a bond to which they turn for their identity. Your Father's Name reminds you who you are, even within a world that does not know; even though you have not remembered it\" (WpI.183.1:3-5)."

Those who do so are engaging in a particularly unworthy form of denial.\" Then in the workbook, Lesson 199, he says to tell ourselves today and every day \"I am not a body. I am free.\" How can I do the lesson, keeping in mind the statement from the text? Also Ken says that awakening from this dream is a process and we should not try to skip over steps. It seems saying \"I am not a body. I am free.\" is trying to skip over steps. What is Jesus up to here?",
    "output": "There are some points to keep in mind so that we can recognize Jesus' purpose in saying things and asking us to do things that may seem to contradict each other in different parts of the Course. He knows our resistance to his message is still great and that we will not be open to everything he has to say. Yet it would be a disservice to us if he were not, at the same time, very direct about just where he is attempting to lead us and did not exhort us to join him in his way of looking at things, for he knows so much more than we do. That Jesus knows we will resist his more radical teachings is evident near the end of the introduction to the workbook when he observes: \"Some of the ideas the workbook presents you will find hard to believe, and others may seem to be quite startling. This does not matter. You are merely asked to apply the ideas as you are directed to do. You are not asked to judge them at all. You are asked only to use them. It is their use that will give them meaning to you, and will show you that they are true. Remember only this; you need not believe the ideas, you need not accept them, and you need not even welcome them. Some of them you may actively resist. None of this will matter, or decrease their efficacy\" (W-in.8:1-6; 9:1-3; italics added). And earlier, towards the end of the text, as he instructs us on how make decisions to have the day we really want, he cautions us, \"If you find resistance strong and dedication weak, you are not ready. Do not fight yourself (T-30.I.1:6-7). And so Jesus presents us his uncompromising and challenging teachings while at the same time acknowledging that we may not be ready to accept them and that it will take time (e.g., W- pII.284). But he also knows that if we will just allow him to get his foot in the door to our closed mind, before we know it, we will be on the other side with him. And that is because there is already a part of our mind that knows and has accepted what he is leading us toward, but if we felt we really had no choice, our resistance would be that much greater. So a lesson such as Lesson 199 should be seen as an invitation to accept a different perspective on ourselves and the world, but never as a call to deny what we continue to experience as our reality, false as it may be."

I'm working on Lesson 168-9 of A Course in Miracles ... which says grace is not learned and grace is not the goal this course aspires to attain ... grace is  the means to get vision first with knowledge but an instant later ... I'm just trying to understand exactly what grace is and how one should try to attain it.",
    "output": "In the Glossary-Index for A Course in Miracles by Kenneth Wapnick, grace is defined as \"our natural state as spirit\" and \"an aspect of God's love in this world.\" It may be helpful in reading passages in the Course which use the term grace, such as the lessons you mention, to remember it is referring to the truth of who we are as spirit, and the reflection of God's love present in our minds: \"Spirit is in a state of grace forever. Your reality is only spirit. Therefore you are in a state of grace forever\" (T-1.III.5:4-6). Grace is not, therefore, something that needs to be attained, nor can it be taught or learned. It is simply the truth that will be revealed of its own when we no longer believe in our guilty, sinful selves identified with the body. Our goal is to become aware of our true identity as spirit because it is what God created us to be. God's grace, His gift, is the identity we share with Him. The process of forgiveness, whereby we uncover all the hidden beliefs about ourselves that are in opposition to this truth, is what will lead us to the awareness of this identity and acceptance of His grace. In other places, however, grace is spoken about somewhat differently. Grace is vision in that it is awareness of our natural state. In the passage you refer to, the Course tells us that the vision of who we are in truth will be followed instantly by knowledge of our Oneness with God, and in that instant awareness of the world disappears. That is our goal, that is grace. It is \"an aspect of God's love in this world\" because our minds hold the memory of God's love and the memory of our true identity as spirit, God's innocent Son. Whenever we are willing to choose to identify with this part of our minds, rather than with the ego, we accept the grace that is ours: \"Grace is acceptance of the Love of God within a world of seeming hate and fear\" (W-pI.169.2:1)."

    "text_input": "Q #304: I keep thinking about what A Course in Miracles refers to as the \"authority\" problem. I understand it to mean that there is a constant struggle within me between what I believe is the \"reason\" for being here and for my life, and what God \"believes\" is the reason for my being here and for my life. Unfortunately--like most concepts the Course teaches--I have a feeling my understanding is missing the mark. Am I even close?",
    "output": "Actually, you are not far off the mark at all. Someone once said: \"If God is your co-pilot, switch seats!\" Jesus tells us that the problem is much deeper than that: \"The authority problem is still the only source of conflict, because the ego was made out of the wish of God's Son to father Him. The ego, then, is nothing more than a delusional system in which you made your own father\" (T-11.in.2:3-4). This obviously is insane, as Jesus himself remarks in the continuation of that passage; yet we continue to allow this conflict to rage in our minds and to project itself out all over the place in many forms, because we believe that to submit to God as our Author and Source would be a sentence of death. Or at the very least, we could not exist as we would like to. Jesus explains: \"The projection of the ego makes it appear as if God's Will is outside yourself, and therefore not yours. In this interpretation it seems possible for God's Will and yours to conflict. God, then, may seem to demand of you what you do not want to give, and thus deprive you of what you want ... You are afraid to know God's Will, because you believe it is not yours. This belief is your whole sickness and your whole fear\" (T-11.I.9:1-3; 10:3-4). So to the extent that you value an individual, autonomous existence, you will unconsciously believe that you usurped God's power in order to get and keep that existence and that He is coming after you to get it back. This is the one-or-the-other principle at the heart of the ego thought system, and fear is its unfortunate consequence. \"To deny His Authorship is to deny yourself the reason for your peace, so that you see yourself only in segments. This strange perception is the authority problem\" (T-3.VI.10.6-7)."

However, I feel that if I don't plan or practice ahead of time I won't be able to function: I won't know what to say or do when the moment arises. I am really quite stalled here. Perhaps I am misinterpreting all of this. Can you somehow clear this up for me?",
    "output": "When A Course in Miracles says: \"I need do nothing except not to interfere\" (T-16.I.3:12) it is telling us primarily not to interfere, because that is what we do. It is not telling us to do nothing in the world or with the body. We need do nothing to be who we are (God's Son), except remove all the beliefs that oppose that truth. That is why the Course describes the ego thought system in all its diverse forms and expressions. Lesson 135 of the workbook is a very good example of this. It exposes the defense system that is set in motion when the mind chooses to identify with the body. In no way does it suggest that any of the defenses or behaviors should be changed or avoided. That is not its goal. The goal of the Course is clearly expressed in the following instruction: \"...seek not to change the world, but choose to change your mind about the world\" (T-21.in.1:7). We can paraphrase this important line replacing \"the world\" with \"the body,\" \"your behavior,\" \"your habits,\" \"your defenses.\" This is a Course in mind training, and nothing else. Understanding this distinction is essential to understanding, and more importantly, applying the principles of the Course. Whenever the Course describes all the things we do as bodies, and the beliefs we hold, it does not tell us not to do them, nor not to believe them. It teaches by showing us the contrast between the effect of the ego belief system (pain) with the effect of the Holy Spirit's thought system (peace). It tells us that what we do on the level of form neither causes nor resolves the problem of the separation on the level of the mind. Therefore, changing your behavioral habits because it will make you feel better about yourself is just as acceptable as any of the things we do to take care of our bodies, our houses, or our cars. As long as we believe we are bodies living in the world these things must be maintained in working order, and taken care as best we see fit. Until our minds are healed of all belief in the separation and in our identity as bodies, our only goal must be to uncover all our hidden beliefs so they can be exchanged for the belief system of the Holy Spirit. Then the mind that is free of guilt will use the body, as described in this lesson, without defenses. This does not mean that the body will then be perfect, or not need food, or sleep, or eye glasses. It means the mind will not confuse itself with the body and will not look to it for safety or for anything. In the process of healing, we are not asked not to plan, or to try to live as if our minds were healed while they are still sick. It is always important in reading the Course to remember that it is addressing the decision making part of the mind. We are asked to choose which teacher we will consult in making our plans. The Holy Spirit tells us that as we make our plans we can remember to search our minds for all of the insane beliefs that interfere with our being able to allow His wisdom to lead us to our truth.

    "text_input": "Q #306: I have been studying A Course in Miracles for about 14 years now and lately I keep thinking about dying. It comes to my mind all the time. It's not particularly scary; but why all this preoccupation with death?",
    "output": "It is not unusual to have thoughts of death become more frequent as you diligently work with Jesus in undoing your ego. The part of you that is identified with the ego--and has been for ages--will experience itself as \"dying.\" Actually, all that is happening is that you are withdrawing your belief in the ego thought system. \"As you approach the Beginning, you feel the destruction of your thought system upon you as if it were the fear of death. There is no death, but there is a belief in death\" (T-3.VII.5:10-11). A major part of the process involves shifting your sense of who you truly are, so it would be evident that the \"you\" that is withdrawing the belief and has chosen Jesus as its teacher is not what is \"dying.\" That decision-making part of your mind is simply choosing to identify no longer with a false identity, but with the reflection of its true Self represented in your right mind by the Atonement principle. The preoccupation with death should diminish and finally disappear when there is no more fear of letting go of your identity as an individual. Without knowing more about you, though, we do not know whether this is the only source of the thoughts. In general, we would recommend consulting with a professional if these death thoughts persist for an extended period of time."

    "text_input": "Q #307: I have been studying A Course in Miracles for over a year now. For the last few months, I have been having this strange and wonderful feeling--my body starts physically vibrating during my morning and night meditations. I feel like something inside me is about to take off, like an airplane, a kind of inner weightlessness. After my meditation, I feel great and full of energy. But sometime this feeling that I am experiencing makes me think and think again. I wonder if other students are or have experienced the same thing I am. I also wonder if it is okay to feel that way.",
    "output": "Although a variety of explanations could be offered to account for your experience with your body, all you need to know is that our own minds translate any experience of abstract love, such as we may experience in meditation, into a form that we can accept, since our ego-identified minds fear the abstract. At times the form may be, as you are experiencing, sensations in your body that you find pleasant, even pleasurable. What will be most helpful to remember as you have such experiences is that you want to be willing to let go of any judgments you may have about them as either good or not good. Or any thoughts to make a big deal out of them. If you enjoy the experience, there is certainly nothing wrong with that. You just don't want to make an altar to the experience and then seek after that, for, as wonderful as it may seem, it still falls far short of what Jesus is holding out to us in his Course. For it is still only a specific symbol, a temporary form, through which you are allowing yourself to feel his healing comfort and unlimited love. For a related discussion, see #181."

    "text_input": "Q #308: I'm not sure how to present this question, because anything I say will most likely be projection and/or an area of my own unrecognized guilt, some unconscious need for drama, to be a victim or martyr, some call for help in me. But please elaborate the Course's position as to why there is hatred and often times cruelty from others when the A Course in Miracles becomes one's path. This has been my path since 1986 and I don't thrust it upon others. If I am asked, I will talk about it. When I ask for help I often don't hear the answer or I'm too upset and caught up in fear.",
    "output": "First of all, it will be helpful to distinguish others' feelings and reactions from your own. For your own reactions are all that you ever really need to be concerned with. Any thought system which so uncompromisingly threatens the ego thought system, as the Course does, will have to be perceived as threatening to anyone who is still identified with the ego. So, as you work with the Course, whether you speak to others of its principles or not, they at some level will have to recognize the difference in you in those moments when you are practicing forgiveness and are identified with your right mind. And if they are threatened by that, then hatred and cruelty-- among a variety of ego reactions--are \"natural\" and not unexpected responses to protect their ego identity. As Jesus points out, \"frightened people can be vicious\" (T-3.I.4:2). None of this really has anything to do with you or your own lessons in forgiveness, unless you in turn react to their reactions to you. For you are now in your wrong mind and are identifying with the guilt there over separation and attack on God that you believe is real. But this is nothing to feel embarrassed or apologetic about. All of us who still believe we are here in this world in the body have unhealed minds that believe in the reality of our own guilt. And any experience that allows us to get in touch with that guilt--which will automatically be projected outward onto others if we are not aware of its origin in our own mind--can be very helpful. So bless your brothers for being the screens for your own projections, for when you react to them with upset and fear, feeling like a victim or a martyr, you are uncovering what your ego has wanted to keep hidden from you, if you are willing to look at it that way. And whenever you remember and are ready, you can look at the no-longer-buried guilt with Jesus or the Holy Spirit, who will remind you that it is all made-up. You may initially be unable to access this help when you are in the middle of the confrontation with someone else, but the only thing that matters is that, at some point in time, you remember you have a different choice about how you can perceive that interaction. And that opens the door to the help that is always available to us."

    "text_input": "Q #309: It keeps being emphasized in the answers here that we need to bring our ego thoughts to the love of Jesus in our right minds. How do we know we are doing that? What I mean is that it's not like talking to someone in human form where you can see them and hear them and speak directly with them and know you are doing it.",
    "output": "Although we can never be certain in any moment if we have turned our minds away from the ego and joined with Jesus, one of the clearer indications is when we feel a release from the heaviness and strain of the judgments we have been holding onto. For that in the end is all that forgiveness is and, whether or not we are conscious of joining with Jesus, we have when we let go of our thoughts of condemnation and attack. When we are honest with ourselves, we can always be aware of the tension we are holding (in our minds, projected onto our bodies) when we are judging, whether it is the negative judgment of hatred and repulsion or the so-called positive judgment of desire and attraction--the feeling that someone or something outside of us is what we want and need. Tension in all its myriad manifestations is always a signal of conflict and separation, whether we interpret it as good or bad. Jesus is not really a separate entity or being like your mother or a best friend, but rather is simply a presence we can experience, whom we can relate to in our minds, at a personal level, while we still believe we are persons. You perhaps have had the experience as you read his words in A Course in Miracles that Jesus is there with you and that he really is speaking to you. Don't let your ego fool you into believing that is only your imagination. That experience is more real than all the experiences with other bodies that we seek after to stave off our loneliness. Joining and peace occur in the mind, and not between bodies. That is why we can feel very lonely despite being surrounded by others, if our thoughts are of separation and isolation. And we can feel quite content and complete just thinking of someone who is not physically present whose love and acceptance we are sure of. Jesus wants us to know that, no matter the vagaries and vacillations of worldly love, his love is always constant, always there. In those moments when we doubt it, we can simply pick up his book and read his words and his promises. There are many, but consider this one passage from the very end of the workbook: \"You do not walk alone. God's angels hover near and all about. His Love surrounds you, and of this be sure; that I will never leave you comfortless\" (W-ep.6:6-8)."

    "text_input": "Q #310: I have been a student of A Course in Miracles for over 10 years, and I recently entered a Doctoral Program in Clinical Psychology. One of the difficulties I have is that I am learning psychological material that is often at odds with the Course. On an intellectual level, I understand and can accept the distinctions. However sometimes I can't, and this causes me some frustration. I worry about how to help another, although I also recognize where the answer lies-- to turn and trust in the Holy Spirit. I even understand that much of what I am learning can be helpful if placed under the direction of the Holy Spirit--the problem is that I often forget. I guess my question is: if I'm inclined toward a particular psychological orientation and practice, say psychoanalysis or narrative therapy, is it okay to follow my interest, but with the Holy Spirit as guide?",
    "output": "It is never the form but only the content that can ever conflict with the Course. In other words, it is the purpose for which you use the particular psychological orientation and practice that determines whether or not it will be at odds with the Course, and not its particular theoretical model of mental illness and health, with its specific applications. Use it for ego purposes, and you will judge and attack the differences it helps you identify between yourself and your clients. Use it for the Holy Spirit's purpose and you will see it as a means for uncovering the ego's patterns and plots and schemes and connivings, both in your client and in yourself, so that they can be released to the healing light of forgiveness. So study whatever therapeutic model appeals to you and become as good at its practice as you possibly can. For training in the symbols of the world enables you to accept a teaching role in the plan for the healing of the Son's mind (W-pI.184.9:1-2). Just never forget that the only true healing comes from the one Therapist Who knows no healing is necessary. Your role is to become an instrument for that healing by first allowing your own guilt and attack thoughts to be healed. When your own blocks have been removed, the healing love can then simply flow through you (T-9.V.7,8)."

    "text_input": "Q #311: It is obvious that Helen and Bill had specific, individual purposes in bringing A Course in Miracles to the world, besides the purpose we all share, which is to forgive and to wake up to knowing ourselves as the one Son of God. I can presume, as the Course says, that we all have an individual part to play in God's plan for salvation; but does that also mean a part in the world?",
    "output": "Since the Courses teaches that the world is an illusion, made by the mind of the separated Son as an attack on God (W-pI.155.2:1, W-pII.3.2:1), it follows that it would not tell us that God's plan for salvation means we have a specific role to play in the world as individuals. It is important to remember that the Course is addressing the mind; specifically, the decision making part of the mind, because nothing exists outside of it: \"Mind reaches to itself. It is not made up of different parts, which reach each other. It does not go out. Within itself it has no limits, and there is nothing outside it. It encompasses everything. It encompasses you entirely; you within it and it within you. There is nothing else, anywhere or ever\" (T-18.VI.8:5-11). Every reference to our role or function in the world, therefore, must be interpreted with these metaphysical principles in mind. There is only one role assigned to us by God: to be His innocent Son. The Holy Spirit's function is healing the mind of the thought of separation, and our only function is accepting this healing through forgiveness. Many passages in the Course seem to imply that each individual has a specific and unique role from God: \"To each He (the Holy Spirit) gives a special function in salvation he alone can fill; a part for only him\" (T-25.VI.4:2). (See also: T-25.VI.7) However, this \"part\" is to accept the Atonement for himself. It is \"special,\" in other words \"specific,\" because we have chosen to identify with our individual bodies in the illusion, and have assigned different roles to ourselves, and to every body. Although these specifics (being a son, daughter, parent, teacher, nurse, CEO) are irrelevant to the outcome, they are important because they make up the classroom the Holy Spirit uses to teach us the truth about ourselves. Each part of the Sonship, therefore, has to play his part by accepting the Atonement \"as an individual\" in his specific classroom and, as you mention, by ultimately accepting his only role and identity as God's Son."

    "text_input": "Q #312: I just finished a meditation on why I haven't had an intimate relationship for so long. Most of the reasons that occurred to me were ego-based. The one I didn't think was ego-based was that I'm just too lazy to put in all the effort it takes. I don't know if this is an appropriate question to be asking, but I think about relationships a lot and I don't seem to be able to help it. I know the Course says that special relationships are just a device to keep you away from the truth and I notice that the A Course in Miracles never addresses the issue of sex or sexuality directly, but I must ask for some guidance here. I have these desires and I don't feel like they're being met. It's hard for me to believe that it's wrong to have these feelings. I'm becoming very frustrated with my life and with this Course. Am I misinterpreting something? I think I must be missing something? Can you help?",
    "output": "Yes, it does sound like you're doing some misinterpreting. By the way, you don't say what the other thoughts were that came to you in your meditation about having an intimate relationship, but the one you mention still sounds ego-based--like someone's mother making a judgment! Rest assured, Jesus or the Holy Spirit do not sound like our mothers' nagging! And the truth is that fear is more likely the reason you're not experiencing an intimate relationship, whatever answers you think you heard. It's true special relationships were made by the ego to distract us from the Holy Spirit's answer--the Course refers to them as \"the ego's most boasted gift\" (T-16.V.3:1)--for they hold out the hope that we can find in someone else the special love that God could never give us (T- 16.V.4). But once we seem to find ourselves in the world of separation, the Course does not teach that special relationships are to be avoided or given up. On the contrary, they become the necessary classrooms in which we learn our forgiveness lessons. In Jesus' own words, \"I have said repeatedly that the Holy Spirit would not deprive you of your special relationships, but would transform them\" (T-17.IV.2:3). So while the Course is telling us that our special relationships--and that would include ones involving sex and physical intimacy--won't bring us the joy of Heaven, nowhere in the Course does Jesus say that those feelings are wrong or bad or sinful. And furthermore, through our participation in those relationships, we have the opportunity to heal the guilt in our minds that we have projected on to them. It could be that we feel victimized either by the special relationships we are in or have been in, or by the fact that we are not now in the ones we believe we want. In the end, the different forms are all the same, but along the way, our part is merely to be willing to be open to the relationships that are already a part of our lives. For each one, whether or not it involves physical intimacy, will offer us an opportunity to find the love that has always been ours, just buried and hidden beneath the guilt and sin in our own minds. You may wish to ask then, not for a specific relationship, but for help in releasing the guilt and the fear that seem to be preventing you from experiencing love. You may be surprised at what opportunities show up in your life when you have that willingness, but don't make the mistake of deciding and defining in advance what those opportunities should look like. Trust that we always find what we need to practice our forgiveness lessons, as we are ready to take our next steps. You may find Ken Wapnick's recent audio on \"Form vs Content: Sex and Money\" of value in thinking about your issues around relationships. You may also wish to take a look at #184 for a related discussion."

    "text_input": "Q #313: I have just realized, with somewhat of a shock, that a series of events that happened in my life--loss of friends, my job, my home--about five years ago seems to be playing itself out again in the same way, under similar circumstances. Everything seems to be falling apart.  I don't want to repeat this because what followed five years ago was the bleakest, loneliest, poverty-stricken period of my life. I feel like I'm the victim of some big reality con and there seems to be nothing I can do to stop it and I'm terrified. It seems that my ego is trying to protect itself by massively intensifying its attack in order to stop me from letting it go by creating bad circumstances in my life. Is there anything I can do to stop what is happening? A friend has suggested that the first time this happened, maybe I should have chosen to go in a particular life direction but didn't and so now circumstances are repeating themselves so I can make the right choice this time. Maybe I'm getting carried away over nothing but if things do fall apart again and I can't change them, it would be nice to have some inner peace with what is happening.",
    "output": "You do not say whether you are a student of A Course in Miracles, but your hunch as to what your ego may be up to suggests you have more than a passing knowledge of the Course's principles. The Course itself says that \"trials are but lessons that you failed to learn presented once again, so where you made a faulty choice before you now can make a better one, and thus escape all pain that what you chose before has brought to you\" (T-31.VIII.3:1). But it is always and only ever talking about the content of our own perceptions of others, and the pain those judgments bring, and not the specific form of events as they seem to play out in our lives. And there is nothing in the Course that says you must repeat the cycle of pain and suffering until you get it right, as if there were some kind of karmic debt to be paid. This may be true within the ego thought system, but the whole purpose of the Course is to expose the insanity of the ego so we can make a choice for sanity against that thought system. So what is to be done? What we all must learn to do is to make conscious our own inner decision to see ourselves as guilty sinners who deserve to be punished for all of our transgressions, beginning with our supposed attack on our Father Who only extends His Love to us. That we believe down deep that we have attacked love is true, but we need to bring that belief into our awareness so we can question its validity, as well as the suffering and pain we believe it calls for. For there is no inevitability to the events of our lives. And even more to the point, there is no inevitability to the interpretation we give to the events of our lives. In other words, we may feel victimized by what seems to be happening to us in our lives, but that interpretation of victimization is nothing but that--an interpretation. And if we're willing to accept our role in giving that interpretation to external events, then we can join with Jesus and allow him to offer a different interpretation in which no one is guilty, including, and especially, ourselves. So if you can begin to recognize that it is your ego that is fanning your fears about the future, based on a faulty premise about yourself, you can begin to question whether you want to continue to listen to that voice. For that voice never wishes any of us well (T-15.VII.4:3). But there is another Voice, once you dismiss the ego's, that only ever wills your perfect happiness (W-pI.101)."

    "text_input": "Q #314: A problem that will not go away, no matter what I do, concerns evil in people in my life: abuse, neglect, selfishness. I want to forgive, but in all honesty I cannot, because inside I am angry and I hate evil. Prayer gives me lots of affirmation of love. I want this love from people. I am also afraid of people. How can I pass through this wall that obstructs my peace?",
    "output": "This type of situation is usually difficult to work through. It requires a great deal of patience and gentleness with yourself. Forgiveness, of course, never means that you deny the \"objective facts\"--the abuse, neglect, and selfishness. It asks that you bring your anger and your feelings of victimization to the loving, non-judgmental presence within you, and just observe yourself holding others responsible for your lack of peace. If you try to forgive when you really don't want to, you are fighting yourself and you will wind up feeling more guilty, which is not a kind thing to do to yourself. Holding on to blame and anger is not sinful and has no effect on Jesus' love for you; it just prevents you from being peaceful and experiencing that love, as you already know. That is all. When you are in touch with your feelings about evil, you might remember Jesus' advice to us concerning the original choice to separate ourselves from God: \"Call it not sin but madness, for such it was and so it still remains. Invest it not with guilt, for guilt implies it was accomplished in reality. And above all, be not afraid of it\" (T-18.I.6:7-9). If you hate evil, you are afraid of it and have forgotten that when love looks on it, it sees only a tiny, mad idea having no power to affect love in any way. That means that the truth about you has been untouched by what you have perceived as evil in others. The part of you that is afraid of that truth continues to see evil as real and powerful, and capable of making you weak. Finally, a therapist or counselor might help you recover some of your inner strength and work with you on your fear of relationships. You could then look at the deeper issues and apply the principles of A Course in Miracles."

Just keep working on your lessons and ask for help in releasing your guilt. Be gentle with yourself and be confident that there is a loving, healing presence within you that sees beyond your guilt and fear. Manage your anxiety as best you can.

    "text_input": "Q #316: Lesson 184 paragraph 8 begins with: \"Think not you made the world. Illusions, yes!\" I have been studying A Course in Miracles for sometime and was under the understanding that God did not create the world, but we did as the ego. We, the ego, made (miscreated) the world in which to express our separateness. Paragraph 8 seems to say that we did not make the world, but we make the illusions we see that are not like God (the pain, suffering, lack, even love, etc.).  What is the Course referring to as the world and what did God create and what did the ego create?",
    "output": "God creates only like Himself. Therefore His creations are the extension of His infinite Love and eternal Life. They are in Heaven, which is the state of perfect Oneness, and they have nothing to do with this finite world, nor can they be understood in terms of anything in this world, because this world was generated by the thought that God has been destroyed (an impossibility, of course). The world we did not make is the real world. The Holy Spirit is the maker of the real world, which is the summation of His teaching us that the world is a classroom in which we learn that all this is an illusion. In the section called \"Perception and Choice\" in the text, Jesus speaks of the Holy Spirit as the \"Maker of the world,\" with a capital M (T-25.III.4,5,8). In those passages, it is unmistakably clear that the \"Maker of the world\" is the Maker of the real world. And the Holy Spirit is called Maker, not creator, because He makes an illusion. The real world is an illusion, but it is a helpful illusion. Thus when Jesus says, \"Think not you made the world. Illusions, yes!\" he is not talking about the illusion that forgiveness is. The point he is making is that we would recognize that the shift in perception that allows us to see the world as a classroom does not come from us. The source of that shift is the Holy Spirit."

    "text_input": "Q #317: As I read about the SARS virus the other day and how it attacks cells, my thoughts went to the attack in Iraq and then to my personal victim story of attack by neighbors (and my subsequent attack/defense). Will you please comment on forgiveness as it relates to any one of these situations and the relationship between them?",
    "output": "You are correct in associating the three different forms of attack you mention. Forgiveness applies to each situation equally, because they are all the same in content. In each case, there are seemingly innocent victims being attacked by outside forces (victimizers), which cause suffering. All the victims may make the ego's righteous cry their own: \"Behold me brother, at your hand I die\" (T-27.I.4:6). Forgiveness, as taught in A Course in Miracles, asks us to become aware of the feelings and judgments that arise when we consider each of these attack scenarios. Our reactions show us the beliefs we hold about ourselves as innocent victims, and our judgments against the victimizers. We are asked first to recognize these beliefs, and then learn to look beyond the external appearances to the real source of suffering, which is a decision in the mind to make the separation real. Forgiveness begins by taking responsibility for this choice and its effects (feeling attacked and victimized), without blaming anyone or anything external to the mind. This is what the Course means by: \"...forgive the Son of God for what he did not do\" (T-17.III.1:5). Any perceived attack, whatever form it may take, is always a reflection of the prior attack on our identity as God's Son by choosing separation in the mind. This is true for ourselves, and for anyone else we perceive as suffering at the hands of others. The \"others\" include military forces, viruses, neighbors, natural disasters, etc. Our responsibility as students of the Course is to acknowledge in ourselves and in others the power of the mind to choose. Once we have done this, we then acknowledge that we all can use this same power of the mind to make another choice. Meanwhile, we do not deny the thoughts, feelings, and judgments about the situation as we perceive it, and bringing them to the Holy Spirit, our minds are free to be guided to act in the most loving way."

    "text_input": "Q #318: In C-1.3:2 it says that the term \"soul\" is only used in direct biblical quotations. Yet I've found that Jesus does use the term several times throughout A Course in Miracles without  directly quoting the Bible. \"The more 'religiously' ego-oriented may believe that the soul existed before, and will continue to exist after a temporary lapse into ego life\" (T-4.II.9:5).",
    "output": "You are right in pointing out that the references to the term \"soul\" in the Course are not direct quotations. All but one of the references, however, do refer to well-known biblical statements regarding the soul, such as \"losing your soul\" (T-12.VI.1). In the clarification of terms it is used to contrast the Course's use of the term \"spirit.\" In this section it is not referring to any specific biblical passage, but reflects traditional religious views of the soul, including Christian belief which is based on the Bible's teaching. Hopefully, finding these imperfections is not an impediment to learning the message of the Course and practicing its teachings. That would certainly not profit the man or the soul."

    "output": "A Course in Miracles teaches that Jesus and the Holy Spirit are symbols which represent the part of our minds which holds the memory of God and reflects His love. When it speaks of taking Jesus' hand, or asking for help, it is making use of these symbols because we, who have dissociated ourselves from our minds and are mistakenly identified with the body, need them. This is best described when the Course tells us: \"You cannot even think of God without a body, or in some form you think you recognize\" (T-18.VIII.1:7). Since we believe we are bodies living in a world of form, the Course uses form to make its message personal and relevant to us. It meets us on the level of form because that is where we think we are. It is also more direct, i.e., in passages that clearly describe the nature of the mind and our true identity (See: T-18.VI.8). There is nothing outside the mind, and therefore, no hand to take (neither ours nor Jesus'), and nothing but the mind itself to choose the truth or the ego's lie of separation. Both of the statements you mention are based on this level of the Course's teaching. Key words in the statements are \"ultimately\" and \"eventually.\" They point to the time when we will have learned that our true identity is the mind. Only then will we realize that the power of choice is ours, and all of our asking has been a reminder to ourselves that we can return to the mind to choose our oneness with God rather than separation. Until then, we need to use any symbol that is helpful to us, such as holding Jesus' hand and asking the Holy Spirit's help, to let go of the fear of the power of our minds."

    "text_input": "Q #320: What does A Course in Miracles teach about having a Soul Mate? Is this considered a special relationship?",
    "output": "Dear Mate: The Course has nothing against having a soul. Seriously, the Course does not refer to \"Soul Mate\" specifically, but insofar as the term means that there is one special person who is meant to fill all your needs and whose needs you are meant to fill, yes, it would be considered a special relationship. If the context is needs, completion, and dependency, then the ego is involved. Special love relationships have their roots in the belief in scarcity--that there is something lacking in us that can be filled only by some special person, upon whom we then depend for our own sense of well-being, happiness, security, etc. Most romantic relationships start out this way, but they can be transformed by exchanging this ego purpose for the Holy Spirit's, which would be to see that both partners share the same wrong mind and the same right mind, and that their interests are shared, not separate. On the other hand, there can be an intense attraction to another person because on a deep level there is some recognition that this is the person with whom you are going to work our your forgiveness lessons (M-3.5:2). The attraction is really to the deeper call of the Holy Spirit's Love, which then would become the center of the relationship. Unlike the ego's notion of completion, which reinforces separation through dependency, the completion in a relationship centered in forgiveness is simply the manifestation of the wholeness of our true Self, which we no longer choose to split off."

    "text_input": "Q #321: How can a being create a being with the ability to create if that original being was itself not created?",
    "output": "Creation cannot be understood from our reference point as human beings, because it has nothing to do with the world of separation and individuals, and therefore has no counterpart in that world. It has meaning only within the Godhead, which by its very nature extends itself eternally in creations. Our human conceptual framework was intentionally established as a substitute for the truth of the Kingdom of God and to keep reality forever concealed from our awareness. Therefore our unhealed minds cannot comprehend what we have deliberately sealed off. Jesus speaks to this at the beginning of Lesson 192: \"It is your Father's holy Will that you complete Himself, and that your Self shall be His sacred Son, forever pure as He, of love created and in love preserved, extending love, creating in its name, forever one with God and with your Self. Yet what can such a function mean within a world of envy, hatred and attack? Therefore, you have a function in the world in its own terms. For who can understand a language far beyond his simple grasp? ... Creation cannot even be conceived of in the world. It has no meaning here. Forgiveness is the closest it can come to earth\" (W-pI.192.1; 2:1-2; 3:1-3). Jesus describes creation, but only briefly, as he knows that it is virtually meaningless to us in our present condition. A similar glimpse of the nature of creation is presented earlier in the workbook: \"True giving is creation. It extends the limitless to the unlimited, eternity to timelessness, and love unto itself. It adds to all that is complete already, not in simple terms of adding more, for that implies that it was less before. It adds by letting what cannot contain itself fulfill its aim of giving everything it has away, securing it forever for itself\" (W-pI.105.4:2-5). These descriptions points us to a reality that has no counterpart in this world. Creation is extension, yet it is completely non-spatial, non-linear, and non-quantitative. The dilemma you expressed, of course, has been the subject of many a philosophical/theological treatise over the centuries. Interestingly, some medieval thinkers in the Franciscan tradition spoke of the \"self-diffusiveness of love.\" Love is not love unless it is extending itself. And in the Thomistic tradition (St. Thomas Aquinas), the reasoning put forth is that unless there is at least one self-sufficient being, nothing would exist. That self-sufficient being would have to be infinite (without limitation), and therefore can extend its being in any way. We can get only so far with this type of speculation, though, because our limited perspective would always cause us to anthropomorphize whatever we conceive of. It might be of help to read through the introduction to the clarification of terms, which addresses the terminology in A Course in Miracles and its exclusive concern."

    "text_input": "Q #322: One section in Chapter 21 of the text of A Course in Miracles which has particular meaning to me is \"The Responsibility for Sight.\" It illustrates the discomfort that comes from realizing that decisions which appear to be made by me are actually being made on another level, a level I am completely unaware of as the decision-maker. \"I\" and the decisions \"I\" appear to make are merely the effects in form of decisions for guilt or innocence made on another level. The statement, \"It is as needful that you recognize you made the world you see, as that you recognize that you did not create yourself. They are the same mistake,\" touches on this issue, and I would appreciate any comments or elaborations on its meaning.",
    "output": "In particular, these two sentences are telling us that we need to accept that we, as the split mind, are cause and not effect within the ego thought system, so that we can let go of the world as a defense against our true Identity and recognize that, in reality, within Heaven, we are Effect and not Cause. We see here, as clearly as anywhere, the insanity of the ego thought system. The separation has seemed to come about because we have resented being the created and not the Creator--Effect and not Cause, Son and not Father. And so we seek to make a new, separate identity for ourselves on God's slain corpse--clearly here we are into a delusional thought system that believes separation from our Source is possible and murder and death are real. Delusions are unstable (T-19.IV-A.8:4) and need constant protection in order to be maintained, and so, in cahoots with the ego, we concoct a wild tale of vengeance and defense, and make a world to hide in, as well as a further false identity--a physical self with its own distinct personality--to hide behind. We forget completely that we are the mind that has dreamed this insane hallucination and instead believe that we are at its mercy-- effect rather than cause. Hence, the insanity of it all, because we had set out to be our own cause and have convinced ourselves that we have pulled it off. But then we relinquish awareness of that \"power\" and accept instead a view of ourselves as effects of the world we made, in order to protect our individuality and to cover over the real source of the pain of separation--our own choice to see ourselves as apart from Love. We see the world as the cause of all of our pain so that we never get to the source in our own mind--of both the world and the pain--where we could make a different choice about ourselves and the guilt we believe is so real. As the statement you cite points out, denying that we are the cause and not the effect of the world is nothing more than a cover over our desire to make a world of our own outside of Heaven and deny our true Identity as God's creation, Christ--each is just a different aspect of the same mistake. But, as your question emphasizes, the shift in perspective back to the mind is not easily made, for our identities are well-entrenched in the world and we have sought to see ourselves as mindless effects or victims of that world. And so Jesus leads us out of our self-imposed prison by inviting us to take small, gentle steps along the path of forgiveness, where we learn to see our interests and our goals as shared with all our brothers rather than as separate. Those little steps will gradually undo the fear and the guilt in our minds so that we will be able first to recognize the \"power\" of our mind to dream of a world that seems powerful and real while we remain in the dream, and then to recognize that, since it is only a dream and we are the dreamer, we have been the cause of nothing real. And so we have remained forever the loving Effects of a Father Who has never changed His Mind about His Love for us. For more on the decision-making power of the mind, you may wish to look at #226."

    "text_input": "Q #324: I sometimes feel that choosing to see peace, for me, is a kind of denial. I know I can look at a situation and choose to see peace. And often I do, and the tension alleviates and my thought of peace brings a peaceful feeling. But sometimes I am surprised by an onslaught of fear and anger and guilt feelings in an ongoing difficult situation that I thought was close to being healed, and then I feel like I had just been denying those feelings in seeing peace. It seems to me that to heal them I have to be in the feelings for a while, not try to see peace but really feel the fear and be un-peaceful for a while. I feel if I try to see peace the instant I feel anxious, I will just be covering up the fear and will not be clear about just what I am bringing to the light to be healed. I am not at the point where I can really look at the fear and be peaceful at the same time. Is this in keeping with the path of A Course in Miracles?",
    "output": "A very honest, thoughtful question. It is true that our egos can fool us at times into believing we have made a choice for peace when all that has really happened is that we have discovered how to get our own way. Nevertheless, you don't want to dismiss all your moments of peace as fraudulent, simply because they are not yet permanent. As a result of our fear of what genuine peace brings with it--a disidentification with the self we think we are--we will vacillate between peace and conflict as our learning proceeds. The fact that the fear in a particular, recurring, difficult situation seems as intense as ever does not invalidate any experience of peace we may have had in a similar situation in the past. Each thought system--the ego's and the Holy Spirit's--is total, and whichever one we choose, when we have chosen it, in that moment we are completely identified with it, regardless of our choices in the past, and we may experience the full range of feelings that accompany that choice. It is helpful to remember also that it is never the external situation that causes our loss of peace --the situation is nothing more than a symbol onto which we choose to project our buried guilt. So the fear is really coming from a perception from within that we are sinful and guilty for attacking God and deserve to be punished. Any external situation can become the screen onto which we project that thought--some are simply more powerful, forgiveness-resistant symbols! Now having said all that, it is important to add that, yes, we do need to look honestly at our guilt and fear before we can release them to the light. Choosing peace is not simply a formula to be chanted whenever our guilt and fear come close to the surface in order to push the feelings back down. And the truth is, there remains a part of us that does not want peace so long as we are identified with the ego. Jesus makes this very clear in the opening lines to Lesson 185: \"I want the peace of God. To say these words is nothing. But to mean these words is everything\" (W- 185.h; 1:1-2). We learn to want peace by looking at what we have chosen instead and acknowledging the cost. And over time, as we allow ourselves to look honestly at what we have chosen without judging ourselves for that choice, the real alternative will become increasingly desirable."

    "text_input": "Q #325: On page 172 of the text of A Course in Miracles (T-9.V.6:3) Jesus states: \"Can you find light by analyzing the darkness ...?\" My question is: If we are to look at our egos as a process, isn't that the same thing as finding light by analyzing darkness?",
    "output": "The context of that statement is the unhealed healer who sees the darkness as real and not as a defense against the light, an expression of the only \"sin\" in the Course: making the error real. As Jesus tells us in the The Song of Prayer: \"Do not see error. Do not make it real\" (S-2.I.3:3-4). In the section in the text to which you refer, Jesus is pointing out the limitations and mistakes of therapists and theologians who attempt to heal others without first having seen their own mistakes and brought them to the healing presence in their right minds. They therefore know nothing of that true corrective process, and as a result they wind up having their egos direct them as they attempt to heal others. If you know that the ego's darkness (the wrong mind) is simply a defense against the Holy Spirit's light (the right mind) and that we can choose between these states, then analyzing the darkness can be helpful in identifying the choices we make. We can then reconsider our decisions. But if we are unaware of the light and the decision-making capacity of our minds, then analyzing the darkness would be fruitless, ultimately. There may be some relief from the pain, but there would be no true healing. In that sense, you cannot find light by analyzing the darkness."

    "text_input": "Q #326: Do you know of people who in the year of taking A Course in Miracles have achieved the experience of the holy instant?",
    "output": "We direct you to Questions #26 and #104, which address this topic. The essence of the experience is recognizing and accepting the love of Jesus as the only reality in your mind. This comes about through choosing against the ego's way of perceiving, which always emphasizes differences and separation, and instead seeing your interests and needs as the same as everyone else's. It is a choice made in the mind, and of course can occur at any time. In the manual for teachers, Jesus speaks about different levels of relationships, the first level being \"... what seems to be very casual encounters; a 'chance' meeting of two apparent strangers in an elevator, a child who is not looking where he is going running into an adult 'by chance,' two students 'happening' to walk home together ... Perhaps the seeming strangers in the elevator will smile to one another; perhaps the adult will not scold the child for bumping into him; perhaps the students will become friends. Even at the level of the most casual encounter, it is possible for two people to lose sight of separate interests, if only for a moment\" (M-3.2:2,5-6). The holy instant is that moment. There are many other expressions of it as well. It may occur at any time during one's spiritual process, and one need not be a student of the Course in order to have this experience. Many, many students have done so. Finally, even though there are 365 lessons and the Course is presented as a one-year program, it is important to take note of what Jesus tells us in the very first sentence after the last lesson: \"This course is a beginning, not an end\" (W-ep.1:1). The training is completed when the holy instant becomes our only experience. We no longer see any value in choosing the ego rather than the love of Jesus in our minds. We go back and forth that way until we have let go entirely of all belief in the reality of separation, and sin, guilt, and fear."

    "text_input": "Q #327: I would appreciate some clarification of the concept of oneness and the following excerpt from the text of A Course in Miracles: \"God, Who encompasses all being, created beings who have everything individually\" (T-4.VII.5:1).",
    "output": "Jesus is simply using the words of our symbolic, dualistic thought system to reassure us that releasing our investment and identification with the ego will not result in any real or meaningful loss. The concept of a hologram can be helpful here, for Jesus in essence is saying that the whole is contained in every part. In reality, any experience of oneness must be beyond all concepts we may employ to attempt to describe it. It is simply an experience of total love that knows no limits, no differences, no perception of an other. That it does not encompass individuality in any real sense becomes clear in Jesus' words later in the Course: \"Oneness is simply the idea God is. And in His Being, He encompasses all things. No mind holds anything but Him. We say 'God is,' and then we cease to speak, for in that knowledge words are meaningless. There are no lips to speak them, and no part of mind sufficiently distinct to feel that it is now aware of something not itself. It has united with its Source. And like its Source Itself, it merely is\" (W-pI.169.5). But Jesus is also aware of our desperate desire to cling to a sense of a separate identity, and so he reassures us, \"Fear not that you will be abruptly lifted up and hurled into reality\" (T-16.VI.8:1). In other words, any shift towards releasing the ego is completely our choice. If it were not, we would be a victims of forces beyond our control, a situation totally antithetical to the Course's gentle teachings on forgiveness. See #17 for a related discussion on releasing our sense of individuality."

But if it does exist, then the Course is incorrect because something in the entire physical universe is not an illusion. Does A Course in Miracles exist?  : Since God does not know of our existence in our current state, why then does prayer to Him do anything? Further, if the Holy Spirit was created to take care of this challenge, then the existence must have been known.",
    "output": "The answer to these questions lies in understanding what the Course teaches regarding reality and illusion. Reality refers to God and the life we share with God as His one Son in Heaven. Only that is real and only that truly exists. The metaphysics of the Course tells us that: \"Into eternity, where all is one, there crept a tiny, mad idea, at which the Son of God remembered not to laugh\" (T-27.VIII.6:2). The \"tiny mad idea\" is the thought that the one Son can be separate from God. Choosing this thought results in what we are experiencing as our lives as bodies in the physical universe. The Course tells us it is an illusion, a dream: \"You are at home in God, dreaming of exile but perfectly capable of awakening to reality\" (T-10.I.2:1). This is the Course's \"explanation\" for the seeming existence of the physical universe; this is the illusion. Yet, because the Son cannot be separate from the Father, he carries with him into the dream the memory of God in his mind. The thought of separation and the memory of God are the two parts of the split mind of the dreaming Sonship. It is very important to remember that this is all part of the dream. It is therefore not real and does not truly exist. Although we have chosen to identify with our bodies there is a part of our mind that remembers who we truly are. The Course refers to this part of the mind of the Sonship as the right mind. Since we have dissociated ourselves from our minds altogether our right mind is symbolized in the Course by Jesus or the Holy Spirit. They are our teachers in the dream and A Course in Miracles is Their curriculum that we may \"Learn that even the darkest nightmare that disturbs the mind of God's sleeping Son holds no power over him. He will learn the lesson of awaking\" (T-13.XI.9:5-6). So, although A Course in Miracles does not exist in reality and is part of the illusion, its message reflects the memory of our reality and leads us to our awakening from the dream of separation. The prayers in the Course that address God the Father are beautiful expressions of the content of the part of our minds that remembers God. They are formulated in a way that helps us to remember God, and to learn that in spite of our belief in the separation we have not truly left our Source. You are correct in saying that God does not actually hear these prayers. They are gentle reminders to ourselves in a form that comforts us, because we need to know that God has not forgotten us though we seem to have wandered off and forgotten Him."

    "text_input": "Q #329: I'm having a difficult time understanding how marriage isn't considered a special relationship, or that you could truly have a sacred relationship with someone.",
    "output": "Most marriages start out as special relationships, but they need not remain on that level. The specialness resides in the purpose or the content, as opposed to the form; and the purpose or content comes from the teacher we have chosen in our minds--either the ego or Jesus. That is the key. Thus you can be married to one person and spend most of your time with that one person, but if the content behind the form is rooted in the healing love of Jesus in your right mind, then you would be excluding no one from your love, or from your kindness, generosity, caring, etc. This obviously does not mean that you have to include everyone else in the world at your dinner table, or in your bedroom, or at the bank when you cash your paycheck. It is important to remember always that relationships are in the mind, and that we cannot usually discern the content just by observing the form. The relationship is made \"sacred\" by shifting from the ego's purpose for the relationship to the Holy Spirit's purpose, and your partner does not even have to be aware of this. The ego's purpose is to reinforce separation and specialness, and the Holy Spirit's purpose is to undo all of that. Marriage, thus, can be an excellent classroom for learning how to relate without a sense of exclusion or specialness. The form might not change at all, but your motivation and interpretations would. You would still do all the same things, have the same intimacy and the same focus on family, or whatever, but you would ask for help to shift from the ego's purpose to the Holy Spirit's. You would then look with the love of Jesus next to you at all of the manipulation, the specialness, the guilt, and the victimization that are a normal part of relationships in the ego's world. And when you look at all of that without judgment, your mind then would be freed to let the love of Jesus flow through you as the content of all your thoughts; and then these thoughts would direct all of your interactions."

    "output": "Iambic pentameter is a way of positioning the sounds of syllables in a rhythmical pattern, and is the most common of all meters in English poetry. This poetry form groups five \"iams\" together for a total of ten syllables per line, putting stress on the second syllable, and every other one after that (i.e., weak STRONG weak STRONG weak STRONG weak STRONG weak STRONG). An \"iam\" is one of the \"weak STRONG\" units, and \"Penta\" means five (as in the Pentagon, which has five sides). It breaks into five \"feet,\" like this: weak STRONG / weak STRONG / weak STRONG / weak STRONG / weak STRONG. A foot is one of the repeating segments that is used to build a line of poetry. In the case of iambic pentameter, one iamb = one foot. Much of A Course in Miracles is written in unrhymed iambic pentameter, and this is called blank verse. Examples include the following: This will / not tempt / me to / de lay / myself. The world / I see / holds noth / ing that / I want (W-pI.128.8:3-4).

    "text_input": "Q #331: Krishnamurti, in one of his books, says that all fear comes to an end the instant all psychological authority including our own ends in the mind. With no authority how can there be fear? He also mentions that all fear comes to an end the instant you realize you are the author of it. He said this doesn't even take a day. Maybe only ten minutes to see it clearly. Can you comment on the above ideas? Lastly, if there are no specialness thoughts why do we have to give them up? Doesn't that reinforce the ego by making it real?",
    "output": "Krishnamurti and A Course in Miracles are not saying anything very much different from each other. The Course simply adds a mythology of the ego to illustrate the origins of the \"dynamics\" of fear. With the belief in separation, the Course says we have made the idea of a separate superior judgmental authority--the ego god, which is really nothing more than a projection of our own desire to seize authority/authorship from God our Source (T-3.VI.7,8)-- very real in our minds. And we remain at odds with this authority so long as we seek to maintain our own individual existence and so to see this controlling authority as separate from ourselves. Fear then is inevitable, for the illusory, fragmentary self we believe we are must seem very vulnerable if we are to deny our role in first seizing the authority for ourselves. We project responsibility for the attack outside ourselves in order to assuage our guilt. The only real Authority is the wholly benign God of Love in Whom we find our being beyond any concepts of separation and individuality. And fear is impossible in this perfect state of Oneness in which there can be nothing apart from Self to fear. And so, in any moment when we release our belief in separate interests and conflicting authority--our own and anyone else's-- and we see our own role in making up the conflict in the first place, all fear must simply vanish. This need not take time, since nothing except our own thinking needs to shift. It is only our own resistance to love, which is how we maintain our separate self, that will make the release from fear seem difficult and likely to take a long time. As for specialness thoughts, you are right, they are not real and they are not the problem. It is our desire for and belief in specialness, and not the thoughts themselves, that must be released, but not by fighting or resisting. We are only ever asked to look at what we have made real in our own minds and acknowledge the consequences of that illusory choice to our peace of mind. When we no longer want specialness and what it brings, the thoughts will simply dissipate \"into the nothingness from which [they] came\" (M-13.1:2)."

At the time, I labeled it the \"anti-karma clause,\" because it seemed to indicate when one forgives/accepts Atonement, the actual event is remembered differently--it is as if the perceptual past is changed in memory for all involved. I know I'm not explaining this well. Maybe you have some suggestions.",
    "output": "Two lovely passages come immediately to mind, one of which perhaps is the one you are looking to rediscover. Both communicate the Course's beautiful teaching that forgiveness lifts us up outside of time and so can release us from all the seeming effects of the time-bound ego. If the Course taught otherwise--that the undoing of the ego must necessarily take time, as the idea of karma entails--then the ego would have to be real and the separation from God would have had to happen. But the fundamental premise, upon which the Course's central practice of forgiveness rests, which is the statement of the Atonement principle, is that the separation never happened in reality. So, in truth, nothing but illusions need to be undone. And so here they are, in the order in which they appear in the text: \"How can you who are so holy suffer? All your past except its beauty is gone, and nothing is left but a blessing. I have saved all your kindnesses and every loving thought you ever had. I have purified them of the errors that hid their light, and kept them for you in their own perfect radiance. They are beyond destruction and beyond guilt. They came from the Holy Spirit within you, and we know what God creates is eternal\" (T-5.IV.8:1-6). \"There is no escape from fear in the ego's use of time. For time, according to its teaching, is nothing but a teaching device for compounding guilt until it becomes all-encompassing, demanding vengeance forever. The Holy Spirit would undo all of this now. Fear is not of the present, but only of the past and future, which do not exist. There is no fear in the present when each instant stands clear and separated from the past, without its shadow reaching out into the future. Each instant is a clean, untarnished birth, in which the Son of God emerges from the past into the present. And the present extends forever. It is so beautiful and so clean and free of guilt that nothing but happiness is there. No darkness is remembered, and immortality and joy are now. This lesson takes no time. For what is time without a past and future? It has taken time to misguide you so completely, but it takes no time at all to be what you are. Begin to practice the Holy Spirit's use of time as a teaching aid to happiness and peace. Take this very instant, now, and think of it as all there is of time. Nothing can reach you here out of the past, and it is here that you are completely absolved, completely free and wholly without condemnation. From this holy instant wherein holiness was born again you will go forth in time without fear, and with no sense of change with time\" (T-15.I.7:6-7; 8; 9)."

    "text_input": "Q #333: How does A Course in Miracles view competition, as in sports, work, speaking (Toastmasters) etc., and how do I apply that view to this dreamlife?",
    "output": "#203 discussed the topic of competition. Competition permeates every aspect of our lives in this world because that is the ego's DNA, you might say. \"The ego literally lives by comparisons\" (T-4.II.7:1). Its very existence is rooted in the competition for ultimate authority over life, and it senses itself always in constant competition with a rival force that is determined to defeat it. As fragments of the ego, we thus share in those properties. The world that emerged from the ego is inherently a world of competition, comparison, and conquest (M-8.1). It is fairly common to hear people say that they thrive on competition and would find life pretty boring without it. As \"offspring\" of the ego, how could it be otherwise, unless we are aware of \"another way\"? Purpose is one of the most important concepts in the Course. Our lives can serve either the purpose of the ego or the purpose of the Holy Spirit. There are no other choices for us to make. If we choose to share the Holy Spirit's perception of ourselves and everyone else, we will be focused on seeing our interests and needs as the same as everyone else's. That would allow us to carry out our roles conscientiously and competently--as an athlete, business person, speaker, etc.--but without ego-based motivations. We thus can learn how to compete without being vicious or cruel or intent solely on destroying the other person, team, or company. The world is set up so that one team/business wins and the other loses, but that does not have to be our focus or motivation, or the reason for our happiness or unhappiness. We can always ask Jesus for help to identify how we support the ego's thought system of divisiveness and kill-or-be-killed. We can become aware of how we delight in watching another individual, team, or company go down to defeat, for example. Then we can bring those thoughts and feelings to the love of Jesus in our minds, understand where they come from, and then choose to follow him instead of the ego. We can then go back into the same situation, but with a new motivation. It is interesting to note that our effectiveness in our roles often is enhanced when we let go of the ego's thirst for victory at the cost of another's defeat. The guilt-attack cycle that is the inevitable consequence of following the ego's kill-or-be-killed approach is a tremendous mental and emotional burden that affects all of our perceptions and judgments. Objectivity is impossible when our minds are caught up in those dynamics. When we are free of that burden, we often function more effectively. Thus you can be skillful and mentally keen in a business deal or on a basketball court, for instance, while at the same time the intent in your mind is recognizing the meaninglessness of all that seems to separate you from the person on the other side of the desk or the other team. The Holy Spirit can use all of our skills--made originally to act out the ego thought system--to teach us about the oneness we share with each other. The following teaching of Jesus can be helpful in redirecting our motivation before we engage in activities that, in form, are competitive. \"I said before that the ego's friend is not part of you, because the ego perceives itself at war and therefore in need of allies. You who are not at war must look for brothers and recognize all whom you see as brothers, because only equals are at peace. Because God's equal Sons have everything, they cannot compete. Yet if they perceive any of their brothers as anything other than their perfect equals, the idea of competition has entered their minds. Do not underestimate your need to be vigilant against this idea, because all your conflicts come from it. It is the belief that conflicting interests are possible, and therefore you have accepted the impossible as true. Is that different from saying you perceive yourself as unreal?\" (T-7.III.3)"

    "text_input": "Q #334: One the most common questions students of A Course in Miracles ask is about forgiving Jesus. For many of us it's a lifetime challenge to forgive ourselves for every dark thought that, still uncovered, rules our mind. So, how would you best encourage us to forgive Jesus?",
    "output": "We must clarify first of all that your question implies that the Course asks us to forgive the negative thoughts we have, i.e., \"dark thoughts,\" as opposed to other \"good thoughts.\" This would mean that we have some unacceptable thoughts that are \"sinful\" and need to be forgiven in the traditional sense. This is not the meaning the Course gives to forgiveness. What the Course asks us to do is to uncover all our \"dark thoughts,\" meaning any thought that has the one thought of separation as its source. This basically means any ego thought about anything. These thoughts have our specialness at their root--the same specialness that we bring to our relationship with Jesus, and it is this that needs to be forgiven, not because it is a sin, but because it makes the separation real. The specific form the specialness takes may vary, but in the end it is always based on the belief that Jesus (and everyone else, for that matter) is separate from us, and in Jesus' case, he is not only separate but \"better\" than us. Just as in all our relationships, our relationship with Jesus is marked by the dynamics that inevitably follow our choice to identify with the ego thought system. One of these is the belief that for someone to gain someone else must lose: \"All choices in the world depend on this; you choose between your brother [including Jesus] and yourself, and you will gain as much as he will lose, and what you lose is what is given him\" (T-31.IV.8:4). This is referred to as the scarcity principle. Some very common thoughts about Jesus are based on this principle, i.e., if Jesus has something we don't have, such as holiness, Atonement, etc., it must be because he stole it from us, and we hate him for it. This often takes the form of believing that Jesus has a special place of privilege in the Sonship, and so God must love him more than He loves the rest of us. What he has can never be ours. Most of us share this belief, yet it is in direct opposition to what Jesus is teaching us in the Course: \"There is nothing about me that you cannot attain. I have nothing that does not come from God. The difference between us now is that I have nothing else\" (T- 1.II.3:10-12). Our forgiveness of Jesus lies in learning this, as does the goal of the Course. It is not that we lack anything that he has, it is that we have given ourselves the burden of all our thoughts and judgments against him, which also means against ourselves. We are asked to learn that we, with Jesus, are the innocent Son of the Father. Our practice of forgiving Jesus then, begins with the uncovering of all the hidden thoughts and beliefs we have that separate us from him, making him and us special. This is how we do what he asks: \"Forgive me your illusions, and release me from punishment for what I have not done\" (T-19.IV-B.8:1). Our thoughts and beliefs about him are our illusions, made up for the purpose of making the separation real and proving we are right about who we are, and God is wrong. What Jesus did not do is make himself separate from us, nor does he share our mistaken belief about ourselves. He is forgiven, therefore, as we learn the truth about ourselves."

    "text_input": "Q #335: When I have unkind and attacking thoughts and do not immediately catch them, is it necessary that I recall those thoughts in detail before I can release them to the Holy Spirit or Jesus to cleanse and reinterpret them for me? Most of the time, I realize only afterwards that my thoughts were unkind and I cannot remember the specific thoughts anymore. So I tell the Holy Spirit or Jesus that those thoughts reflect a goal that prevents me from accepting my true function. This approach has given me a tool that I can generalize to almost all the selfish, ego- based thoughts I have most of the time. They all seem to pass rapidly by and sometimes I just put them all in one bunch and offer them. Can you help me here?",
    "output": "In the end, it does not really matter what specific form our attack thoughts take. It is their purpose, or goal, that we are concerned about, and that purpose is always to reinforce our own guilt and sense of separation. And so it is the purpose in our mind and not the particular thoughts and words and actions we've employed for that purpose that we want to be in touch with. However, before we can reach that level of generalization of our lessons, it is important that we not skip over any of the specific steps that lead us to the recognition of the sameness of all of our ego judgments. And so you would want to ask yourself as honestly as you can whether your difficulty in remembering the specifics may be the result of a sense of fear and guilt about those thoughts that is saying to you, \"Don't look! These judgments and attack thoughts are too awful to look at. Just accept that you've sinned and then get rid of it by offering the heavy burden to Jesus or the Holy Spirit.\" This is not quite what Jesus is asking us to do (T-13.III.1:1-2)! But only you can answer for yourself whether it is your own fear that is keeping the specific thoughts out of your awareness. Now if this is in fact the case, you don't want to make a big deal about it. So you're afraid, but who isn't? All you want to do then is to begin to develop a willingness to look at your ego and perhaps at first begin to remember how it has trapped you in its shenanigans in your recent past. And over time, with practice, you will learn to recognize your choice for the ego while you're in the middle of it. The value of this is that you will then know you have a different choice in the moment when you've chosen to identify with your ego and you won't have to prolong the suffering and pain that accompanies identifying with your ego. So don't try to force anything or make yourself remember, but simply offer that little willingness to look at your ego together with Jesus or the Holy Spirit (T-12.II.10) so that you can see its nothingness."

    "text_input": "Q #336: A Course in Miracles asks us to not bring truth to illusion, not to ask the Holy Spirit to do things for us in the world. In one of Ken's audios on judgment he says that it may be our experience that the Holy Spirit seems to do things for us in the world but it is not the reality. He gives the analogy that in our experience the sun sets and rises, whereas the reality is that the earth spins on its axis and rotates around the sun. Even though it seems as though the Holy Spirit does things for us in the world what is the reality of that experience? What is the correct view of seeing the situation when, for example, improvement in the world manifests after asking/praying to the Holy Spirit?",
    "output": "A change in the external situation could be the result of a decision in your mind not to punish yourself any more--meaning that a dominant belief in the ego part of your mind is that you do not deserve to be happy because of your \"sin\" against God. Therefore, that belief could be expressed in form as suffering, victimization, misfortune, etc. in your personal world. But as you bring your guilt and your ego thoughts to the healing love of Jesus in your right mind, the guilt disappears, and then you would no longer seek to hurt yourself. Thus the external situation would seem to have changed, but your decision against the ego was the real change. Praying to the Holy Spirit could be the form you chose to shift from wrong-minded thinking to right- minded thinking. This applies both on the individual level as well as the collective level. So it is not as if the Holy Spirit changes things in the world. The Holy Spirit is not an agent who acts in the world in response to the requests made of Him, even though the language in the Course suggests that at times. A major part of the mind-training of the Course involves teaching us not to confuse symbol with source. It is hard for us to think of everything as symbols, because we have identified with the ego's way of perceiving, which is to deny that there is only mind and its contents, and that \"ideas leave not their source.\" It is helpful to remember a few points when thinking about this topic: Our minds are very powerful; the body does only what the mind directs it to (the body is not autonomous); and we cannot affect another person's mind or condition without there being mutual consent. If there is one principle that Jesus stresses again and again, it is the power of our minds to decide. The final section in the text, as you know, is \"Choose Once Again\" (T-31.VIII). And very early in the text he tells us that the purpose of his course is to teach us that our minds are very powerful and that we are responsible for our thoughts and feelings: \"The correction of fear is your responsibility. When you ask for release from fear, you are implying it is not ... You may still complain about fear, but you nevertheless persist in making yourself fearful. I have already indicated that you cannot ask me to release you from fear. I know it does not exist, but you do not. If I intervened between your thoughts and their results, I would be tampering with a basic law of cause and effect; the most fundamental law there is. I would hardly help you if I depreciated the power of your own thinking. This would be in direct opposition to the purpose of this course\" (T-2.VI.4:1-2; VII.1:1-6). Thus our work with the Course should be aimed at restoring to our awareness the power of our minds to choose, and to perceive others as having that same power. The cause of all of our problems (the effect) is that one wrong choice we made in our minds to accept the ego thought system as the truth instead of thought system of the Holy Spirit. Jesus and the Holy Spirit are present within our minds to help us get back to that decision-making level in our minds, which is why Jesus tells us that \"this is a course in cause and not in effect\" (T-21.VII.7:8), and \"Seek not to change the world, but choose to change your mind about the world\" (T-21.in.1:7)."

    "text_input": "Q #337: What are errors and mistakes? Are they physical actions or ways of looking? Why does the ego always remind us of how we hurt people or ourselves, or if something wasn't fair. Why does the ego seem right and why does it seem logical? Is it the ego or the Holy Spirit pointing out my faults? If the Holy Spirit helps one correct the error does that mean the ego is right in its judgment of the so-called \"error\"? How do you know if it's an error and why does the ego demand \"correction\" of it as well? Also it states a few times about how a Son of God will not murder yet animals murder all the time to live. Is nature wrong and how are we exempt from it?",
    "output": "It could take a book to answer your litany of questions satisfactorily, but we will try to suggest a few ideas here that will hopefully point you in the right direction. Since, from the perspective of A Course in Miracles, there is only mind, errors or mistakes can be only of the mind. Jesus clarifies this very early in the text when he explains that \"only the mind is capable of error. The body can act wrongly only when it is responding to misthought\" (T-2.IV.2:4-5). And, as you suggest, errors are really mistaken ways of looking or, to be more specific, mistaken ways of looking at the world, our brothers, and ourselves with the ego as our guide rather than with Jesus or the Holy Spirit. And ego-directed looking is always judgmental. It is only the ego that points out our faults. The Holy Spirit will gently invite us to recognize how our thinking is misguided when we listen to the ego, but His purpose would never be to accuse us or to induce guilt in us over our mistakes (T-9.III.1). Now our original error was the thought that we could separate ourselves from God and that we have in fact succeeded in establishing a separate identity for ourselves independent of Him. Every error that has followed since in our thinking comes from that initial thought of separation. But we have deliberately compounded the errors in our mind in such a way that we have quite intentionally confused ourselves and lost sight of that original error. So all of our errors since the initial one are really subterfuges that keep us unaware of the original mistake and focused instead on addressing all the other seeming mistakes and problems in our life. And so that is why the ego, as you observe, is always reminding us of how we hurt others or have been hurt ourselves-- this is the cover for the real problem, so that we never call the belief in separation into question. Just because the ego is based on a mistaken thought, an insane premise--that we could separate from God--does not mean that the thought system built on that premise does not have a very definite and persuasive internal logic to it, once we accept its premise. Jesus in the Course says, \"The ego's logic is as impeccable as that of the Holy Spirit, because your mind has the means at its disposal to side with Heaven or earth, as it elects\" (T-5.V.1:4). And in fact, logic has its origins in the ego thought system, for there is nothing to decide or deduce or prove in Heaven. But having once accepted the ego's logic, which seems to condemn us to hell for eternity, the good news is that we can let go of our guilt-reinforcing use for it and allow the Holy Spirit to guide us in its application, with very different results: \"The Holy Spirit uses logic as easily and as well as does the ego, except that His conclusions are not insane. They take a direction exactly opposite, pointing as clearly to Heaven as the ego points to darkness and to death. We have followed much of the ego's logic, and have seen its logical conclusions. And having seen them, we have realized that they cannot be seen except in illusions, for there alone their seeming clearness seems to be clearly seen. Let us now turn away from them, and follow the simple logic by which the Holy Spirit teaches the simple conclusions that speak for truth, and only truth\" (T-14.in.1:4-8). Correction in the Holy Spirit's thought system is different in every way, including purpose, from the ego's. The ego sees error as sin to prove its own existence and to convince us that we can see the guilt we have made real over that error in others rather than in ourselves. In contrast, the only error the Holy Spirit corrects is our belief in the ego. Clearly this is an error the ego cannot correct, since its own existence depends on our belief in separation. The ego corrects through attack and punishment, the Holy Spirit through the gentle process of forgiveness. And the Holy Spirit begins to undo our belief in separation by leading us toward a recognition of shared rather than separate interests with our brothers. For more on the contrast between the Holy Spirit's and the ego's correction of error, you may wish to look at \"The Correction of Error\" in the text (T- 9.III). The Son of God cannot attack or murder in reality. But that he can believe he can is apparent when you pick up a newspaper or watch the news on TV, or simply examine your own thoughts when you are angry. It is not nature that leads humans or other animals to kill. Nature is just an aspect of the illusory world, which is an effect of our mistaken choice in the mind for separation. It is the desire to protect our individual illusory self at any cost that leads to murder first in thought and then in action. And yet, contrary to what the ego, the world and our senses may tell us, correction is not needed at the level of behavior, but only in our feverish imaginations that believe that all of this is real. \"What if you recognized this world is an hallucination? What if you really understood you made it up? What if you realized that those who seem to walk about in it, to sin and die, attack and murder and destroy themselves, are wholly unreal? Could you have faith in what you see, if you accepted this? And would you see it?\" (T-20.VIII.7:3-7). This does not mean that we are asked to deny what our eyes seem to show us, but rather to be open to a different interpretation of what we see, through the miracle. The miracle brings our focus back from the world to our minds, where we can acknowledge the purpose we have given the world--to be the projection of our error outward, so blame rests elsewhere. Having taken this step, we can then invite the Holy Spirit to give the world His purpose--the recognition that the error in truth never really happened and our guilt is not real."

    "text_input": "Q #338: I know that if I attack another I will feel guilty and I should ask the Holy Spirit for help if I feel I've been attacked. Would this apply equally if I have a behavior such as an addiction that I feel guilty about? If I continue with the behavior I am sure to feel guilty. If I stop the behavior I may not feel guilty, but I really haven't fixed the problem. What would be the best way to handle this situation? The specific problem I am talking about is overeating.",
    "output": "Yes, whether I am attacking another, feeling attacked by another, or attacking myself--which is what an addiction represents--the only appropriate response is to ask the Holy Spirit for help. An addiction is an attack on myself because it says, over and over again, that I am incomplete and must seek outside myself for my completion, a repeated denial that I am the Christ, forever one with Its Source (T-29.VII.2-4,6). All attack, no matter how it is expressed, is nothing more than the projection of the hidden guilt in our minds that the ego insists we must bear because of our (imagined) attack on God at the moment of separation, when we denied our reality as Christ. We've convinced ourselves that our guilt is real, but then have attempted to avoid responsibility for it. And so we seek to project the guilt outside our mind so that it seems to reside instead in bodies, our own and others. We keep this dynamic hidden from ourselves, so that the guilt remains protected. But when we ask for help from Jesus or the Holy Spirit, we are really indicating a willingness to accept responsibility (but not blame!) for the way we feel, seeing the external situation now, not as the problem, but rather as an indicator of the guilt that would otherwise remain unconscious in the mind. And so, as you observe, focusing on changing or controlling the behavior, such as overeating, does not address the real problem. For we are only modifying an external symptom, or effect, of the guilt without addressing the cause, the guilt itself, which, remaining unexamined, we will continue to believe is real. Consequently, we will look to project the unbearable but nevertheless illusory guilt onto some other external form, perhaps another addiction. Early in A Course in Miracles Jesus speaks of how controlling or changing behavior, without addressing the mind, simply produces strain, which is intolerable, leading usually to rage and further projection (T- 2.VI.5). Now this does not mean that there is no value in developing some discipline and bringing out-of- control behavior under control, especially if the addiction is physically or emotionally damaging to us, thereby reinforcing the guilt in our minds. And the choice to bring about a helpful external shift may certainly reflect a real but still perhaps unconscious desire for an inner shift from the ego to the Holy Spirit as our teacher. But at some stage in our learning, we will come to recognize that guilt in the mind is always the only problem. Only through recognizing its inevitable projection out onto the world of form do we begin to become aware of it in our mind, where we can make a meaningful choice for its release. A single audio by Kenneth Wapnick, as well as a small book transcribed and edited from the audio, both titled Overeating: A Dialogue, explore the issue of overeating in greater depth. The material, while addressing food addictions, can be applied to any addiction, since the content is always the same. There is also additional discussion of addictions from the Course's perspective in #30 and #57."

    "text_input": "Q #339: There are two quotations (among many) in the workbook of A Course in Miracles which have puzzled me for a very long time. I would appreciate some clarification. (i) \"You will begin to understand it when you have seen little edges of light around the same familiar objects which you see now. That is the beginning of real vision ... As we go along, you may have many 'light episodes'\" (W-pI.15.2:2-3; 3:1). I have been doing this material for years and know a great",
    "output": "many people who have also, and no one I know has had such an experience, although I have had some wondrous experiences. (ii) \"The time will come when you will not return in the same form in which you now appear, for you will have no need of it\" (W-pI.157.7:3). I assume this means when we leave the body, but in what form will we reappear? A (i): This passage has been troubling to many students. It seems to suggest that a mark of spiritual progress is seeing edges of light around objects, such as auras. If this were the literal meaning, it would go against everything else the Course teaches. Jesus, as we know, stresses that all perception is unreal. In the text he says that however holy visions may be, they do not last because they are based on perception (T-3.III.4:6). Light is a symbol; it is not a perceptual thing. Perceiving light outside you symbolizes the release of some of the darkness in your mind and allowing more of the light to come through. When the Course talks about the light in us, it is not talking about an electric light bulb, an aura, or anything that we actually perceive. Light traditionally has been a symbol used in spirituality to denote God, life, truth, etc. So A Course in Miracles uses that same imagery. Darkness refers to the darkness of guilt and of being separate from God; light refers to the undoing all of that, along with feeling God's Presence and His love. This passage originally had nothing to do with the Course itself. Helen Schucman and Bill Thetford had a close friend who worked with them at the Medical Center--he was the only person they shared the Course with right from the beginning. From time to time he would wake up in the middle of the night and feel and see light all around him. He was terrified by these episodes. So this was Jesus' way of telling him that everything was all right when he had those light episodes. (See Absence from Felicity, p. 304.) That is why this passage appears. Kenneth has felt that there should have been a footnote or some explanation to that effect. In any case, it should not be taken to mean that if you don't see light that you are a spiritual failure. It can be taken to mean rather that when you forgive more, there will be more \"light\" in your mind, which means that that light will be extended. Then you will perceive the world as a \"lightened\" place, in the sense that the burden of guilt will no longer be upon it. Some people actually perceive light physically. But that should be understood only as a symbol--one of many, many symbols-- of the process of healing within their own minds. A (ii): Similarly, the passage in Lesson 157 was originally meant for Helen Schucman herself. Kenneth comments in Absence from Felicity: \"On a number of occasions Helen mentioned to me that Jesus told her that the 'next time you come you would be different,' reminiscent of the lines in Lesson 157. Incidentally, this was one of Helen's favorite lessons. Her understanding of these lines, even though the subject of reincarnation usually made her very uncomfortable, was that the next time she 'came'--her next life--she would be ego-free, as was the priestess of her vision\" (p. 476). So this passage can be understood to mean that when the purpose of forgiveness is fulfilled, we shall have no further need of the body as a classroom. We shall have remembered who we are as God's one Son as we enter into the real world. When we next appear in the body, we would obviously be different because the thought in our minds would be different. The body would not be our classroom but solely a means through which the Holy Spirit can communicate His message of healing and forgiveness. Jesus speaks of \"Teachers of teachers\" in this manner: \" ... although they are no longer visible, their image can yet be called upon. And they will appear when and where it is helpful for them to do so\" (M-26.2:2-3)."

    "text_input": "Q #340: I am very confused about something. This idea of \"pets\" being part of the Sonship really has me. You mean a pet, my dog for example, has a Self just like I do and is capable of  accepting a miracle? If one leaves this body and comes back to learn his or her forgiveness lessons, we can come back and learn this as a dog or a cat? Is that really so?",
    "output": "The simple and direct answer to your question is that neither you nor your dog accept a miracle. Nothing happens on the level of form in the dream. It is in the mind of the sleeping Son that a miracle is accepted and lessons are learned. Neither human beings in bodies, nor cats, nor dogs learn lessons. The mind that projects itself into the illusion gives form to all aspects of the physical universe, including dogs and human bodies, none of which has any ability to choose a miracle (T-28.IV.9). The world and everything in it takes form as a result of the mind of the Sonship choosing to believe that separation from God is possible, thus denying its true identity as spirit. That single thought in the mind is projected outward, giving rise to the world of form. However, one of the most important metaphysical principles of A Course in Miracles tells us: \"Ideas leave not their source\" (T-26.VII.4:7; see also W-pI.132). Therefore nothing happens outside of the mind. What we think is solid and real is an illusion (W-pI.155.2:1), which is why human bodies, dogs, and cats do not accept miracles, forgive, or learn lessons. It is not that your dog has a Self, it is that the separated self denies its truth as spirit. It then splits off into the billions and billions of forms that make up the illusory world, and then identifies with that world. \"There is no world!\" (W-pI.132.6:2). The Son remains asleep, dreaming about human bodies, dogs, trees and oceans, and believing that the dream is real. In truth there is only the mind and nothing else. Part of the dream is that bodies die and return in different form. This dream continues as long as the mind continues to choose to believe in the separation. None of this has any effect on the truth, however, and will end when the mind chooses to forgive every form of mistaken identity in every aspect of the dream. Meanwhile, our task is to recognize all the ways we seek to make our mistaken identity real through unforgiveness, so we can then bring them to the Holy Spirit to be corrected through forgiveness."

    "output": "All the separated fragments of the Sonship, seemingly dispersed when the thought of separation was taken seriously will, through forgiveness, return to full awareness of the Oneness that was never truly shattered. We perceive ourselves as separate from each other, housed in bodies that interact and communicate through bodies. The Course tells us that this perception is the result of a choice in the mind to be separate: \"The gap between you and your brother is not one of space between two separate bodies. And this but seems to be dividing off your separate minds. It is the symbol of a promise made to meet when you prefer, and separate till you and he elect to meet again. And then your bodies seem to get in touch, and thereby signify a meeting place to join. But always is it possible for you and him to go your separate ways. Conditional upon the 'right' to separate will you and he agree to meet from time to time, and keep apart in intervals of separation ... \" (T-29.I.4:1-6). The \"'right' to separate\" refers to the choice we make when we identify with the body. We meet when we accept the Holy Spirit's correction for this mistaken belief, thereby acknowledging our oneness with all our brothers. Although this takes place in the mind, it may be reflected in the dream when \"bodies seem to get in touch.\""

Everything seems, especially now, to be reliant on privilege, money, looks, age, class, race, influence, brains or ability. I feel a lot of love, but feel no incentive to get nearer to people's egos. I feel safe this way. Nothing to date can really convince me to be otherwise. Nevertheless this has become painful. I have a few friends yet it is lonely. I must be misinterpreting A Course in Miracles. Also, I thought it was good to have boundaries (walls). Any ideas?",
    "output": "You're recognizing how painful, empty and meaningless the world of our egos is, and this can be a helpful but nevertheless very disconcerting realization. But you don't want to stop with this insight without taking the next step, for you have not yet completely switched teachers. For it is only the ego that judges and fears other egos. While you remain where you currently find yourself, differences still seem very real and rejection based on those differences almost unavoidable. And so it seems safety can be found only in withdrawal from the world. Yet isolating yourself only reinforces the belief in differences and separation in your mind, which must be experienced as very painful. It makes the error real--very serious and threatening-- which is the ego's only goal. And so you want help in seeing the world of differences differently, and above all, in coming to recognize the real source of the meaning your own mind is giving to those differences, so that you can be open to a different, more gentle way of looking at the world and yourself. As contrary to our conscious beliefs about ourselves as it may seem, the truth is that we all unconsciously want to be rejected, so that the responsibility for rejection rests outside of ourselves (T-7.VII.8) and we don't have to look at the choice for rejection that we have first made and then buried in our own minds. The initial rejection was our rejection of God through our desire to be separate and apart from Him and His All-Encompassing Love. As a result of that choice, we seem to have deprived ourselves of love, a very painful state. We have rejected not only God, but our true Self, the Christ, Who is forever one with the Father. Without separation, rejection would be impossible, for there would be nothing outside to reject. In fact, \"the separation is the notion of rejection ... Any split in mind must involve a rejection of part of it, and this is the belief in separation\" (T- 6.I.18:4; T-6.II.1:1). Now, in reality, we can neither reject God nor ourselves, but we can believe that we have and convince ourselves that we are very sinful and guilty for that choice--and vulnerable to counterattack as punishment for our choice. And so we made up a world onto which we project the attack and guilt, as well as a self that can be rejected by that world, never remembering where the thought of rejection originated. And now we can protest our innocence, for clearly it is others who are doing the rejecting (T-7.VII.9). The Course's purpose is to get us in touch with this self- deceiving dynamic, where we project responsibility for rejection on to others. And so it is not with our external relationships that we want to seek changes, but rather with our internal relationships. We want to learn to reject the ego and its erroneous interpretations of what seems to be happening to us and turn instead to Jesus or the Holy Spirit, Who will help us understand what our ego has been up to. Those external relationships that seem to be the cause of feelings of rejection are nothing more than the effects of an inner decision to continue to hold on to the belief in separation and rejection. And so they are helpful triggers for directing us inward to where the real healing work needs to happen. So to avoid relationships in the world would be to avoid the opportunities to uncover and heal the guilt within--exactly what the ego wants! Now this does not mean you should force yourself to be in situations that you find uncomfortable or painful, where rejection by others is certain. Before we remember that we are really a part of the boundless Love that created us as Christ, boundaries in our external relationships can be very helpful as we learn to trust our inner Teacher and become more comfortable at looking at our judgments of ourselves and others. But as the willingness to look within and heal the darkness there increases, the fear of rejection from outside must diminish, as will the need for boundaries. For \"only those who give over all desire to reject can know that their own rejection is impossible\" (T-3.VI.9:1)."

    "text_input": "Q #343: Since it is my body's brain that is thinking, then in turn asking questions, listening to Ken/others and acting out in this world, isn't it quite unlikely that we will ever \"get it?\"",
    "output": "Now who told you that your brain thinks? It must have been your ego! Your question, which you are not alone in asking, only reflects how effectively we have accepted the ego's ruse that we are a body and not a mind, and how totally identified we are with this false self, even though it is not our reality and it is not where our thinking originates. Jesus is aware of our confusion, for he observes, \"You also believe the body's brain can think. If you but understood the nature of thought, you could but laugh at this insane idea,\" adding that it is \"foolish ... to believe the body's eyes can see; the brain can think\" (W-pI.92.2:1-2,4). As further evidence of our confusion, in speaking of those of us who believe we are born into this world, he notes, \"Their minds seem to be trapped in their brain, and its powers to decline if their bodies are hurt\" (T-13.in.2:7; italics added). Our mistaken beliefs about ourselves in no way change the fact that all thinking, all consciousness (T-3.IV.2), all judgment, all choice, happen in the split mind and not in the body's brain, which is nothing more than an illusory shadow of the mind's guilt over the seeming separation. But we have deliberately set up our mistaken identity, in league with the ego, so that we no longer remember that we are a mind that has a choice about this whole bungled state of affairs, thereby assuring the ego's continued unquestioned existence. But our goal in the Course is not to undo our identification with the body and our belief in the brain's thinking powers. Rather our goal is to undo our belief in the reality and value of guilt and attack in our relationships--experienced between bodies in the world, although they are happening only in the mind. Jesus never asks us to do any more than what he knows we are capable of. We may not be capable yet of releasing our identification with this body, but we are quite capable of forgiving our special relationships, with his help. And that's all we need to \"get.\" The rest, if we do our part, Jesus assures us, will take care of itself. We are not responsible for the effects of the miracle--we are only responsible for choosing it (T-27.V.1:2-5). And it does not matter whether we think we are making that choice with our brain or with our mind. Our willingness to forgive, that is, to release our judgments and our insistence that we know what we need, is all that matters. For further discussion of the relationship between mind and body, you may wish to review Questions #89, #117, #226 and #322."

    "text_input": "Q #344: In A Course in Miracles T-1.VII.1 it reads:  \"Your distorted perceptions produce a dense cover over miracle impulses, making it hard for them to reach your own awareness. The confusion of miracle impulses with physical impulses is  a major perceptual distortion. Physical impulses are misdirected miracle impulses. All real pleasure comes from doing God's Will. This is because not doing it is a denial of Self.\"  I read a similar question/answer already posted around sexual impulses ... but my questions are slightly different and I need some help understanding these series of phrases referenced above: Is this a different way of saying that the decision-maker constantly is choosing between the right- mind and the wrong-mind, the Holy Spirit and the ego? If a miracle is forgiveness, or a reminder that what the body's eyes see/perceive is false, then is a miracle impulse part of a corrective thought process from the Jesus/Holy Spirit in our mind?",
    "output": "Yes, your explanation is a good one. It may still be helpful to clarify why Jesus refers to \"physical impulses\" as \"misdirected miracle impulses\" and how our \"distorted perceptions ... cover over miracle impulses.\" We were created to be in perfect joy without ceasing, and the split mind, despite its mistaken beliefs about who it is, still remembers that state of happiness indirectly, primarily through its acute awareness that it is desperately unhappy. And so it is impelled to seek to return to a state of peace and joy, our natural state. The miracle impulse, or the tendency to choose a miracle, is motivated by the recognition that we are unhappy in our current state of apparent separation and deserve more than what we are presently experiencing. But more than that, the miracle leads to a recognition that the deprivation that we feel is self-imposed, that is, it reflects a choice we have made. The miracle is a natural tendency of the mind, for it is a step in returning the mind to its original state of wholeness and peace, with all conflict left behind. The miracle reminds the mind that it is mind, or cause, and not a body, or effect (T-28.II.9:3). So miracle impulses are thoughts of the Correction, which the Holy Spirit represents to us in our right mind, that remind us that what we think has happened-- the separation from love and all the accompanying pain and guilt--has not really happened at all. And that recognition, when fully embraced, must spell the end for the ego and its symbolic expression, our individual self. So the ego, unable to remove what motivates the miracle impulse--our desire to return to our natural state of peace and joy--must distort and disguise the impulse so that we fail to remember our role in what we are experiencing. For if we truly remembered, we would not remain identified with the ego and separation for long. And so, to prevent our changing our mind, the ego does not ask us to deny our state of unhappiness, but through its distorted perceptual lens, convinces us that our unhappiness has nothing to do with any choice we have made but rather is the result of being born a helpless body into a world over which we have no control. And so the ego acknowledges our unhappiness and the conflict we feel, but guides us to look outside ourselves--to others, to the world--rather than within to find the joy and the peace and the love. And the search is destined to fail because it denies Who we really are and what our real Source of happiness is. Nevertheless, when we seek for pleasure in any form for the body, which we mistakenly identify as ourselves, the seeking is still motivated by a recognition--albeit unconscious-- that happiness is our natural state. This is the same recognition from which the miracle impulse arises, but the seeking is misdirected. And all seeking in the world, because it reinforces our belief in separation, denying the only Identity in which real joy can be found, must in the end result in pain. Thus, Jesus concludes that \"all real pleasure comes [only] from doing God's Will.\""

    "text_input": "Q #345: Sometimes in A Course in Miracles, Jesus seems to be encouraging us to let go of the simple physical pleasures of this world (for example, a really good cup of coffee), not because they are sinful of course, but because they reinforce our belief in sin and death. Do you see in the Course's teachings evidence of the possibility of truly reaching the peace and joy of God while  still enjoying that good cup of coffee. Put another way, is it possible to really experience \"I am not a body. I am free\" without giving up the body's simple pleasures?",
    "output": "Yes, it is entirely possible to enjoy a good cup of coffee and still know that you are not your body. But your experience of inner peace would not change if that cup of coffee were not there as expected, or if the cup broke when you picked it up and the coffee spilled all over the floor. When you truly accept and experience that you are not a body, you are no longer dependent on anything of the body or the world as a source of fulfillment or well being. You could enjoy the \"simple pleasures of the world,\" but you would have no investment in either having or not having them. Enjoying a good cup of coffee can neither bring you salvation nor deter it. When your mind is healed, your real pleasure comes from the experience of shared identity with everyone else as Christ. Jesus teaches us that we will be happiest when we fulfill our function of forgiveness (W-pI.121; T-1.VII.1:4), and he helps us distinguish between the truly valuable and the valueless (W-pI.133; M-4.I.A). But he never asks us to give up--in terms of sacrificing--what we still want and feel is important in our lives. Honesty about what we desire is always a helpful approach to take in this, as is being free of judgment about it. This is not a course in asceticism; the body and the things of the world are not the problem, as many other spiritualities teach. The purpose for which we use them is the only meaningful aspect. On one level, taking pleasure in anything of the world represents an attack on God and our true inheritance as His Son. However, since we are too frightened to simply let go of our mistaken belief that the world and the body are real, Jesus gently teaches us how to use the world and the body in a way that would facilitate the healing of our minds. He counsels us to see our lives as classrooms with either him or the ego as our teacher--the choice is ours to make. So if we join with Jesus and view our lives as classrooms in which we are learning how to awaken from the nightmare of separation from God, then our focus will be on identifying how we reinforce the separation in our interactions and relationships. In this context, enjoying a good cup of coffee is irrelevant, unless we make it into a big deal, which we easily could by allowing it to make or ruin our day, and then hold someone else responsible."

    "text_input": "Q #346: After years of searching and studying many religions, I have found A Course in Miracles provides the answers I crave. My husband has a copy of the Course, which I gave him, but has not paid much attention to it. Recently he was baptized and joined the Baptist Church here in the South. Wanting to support his need for spiritual nourishment, I also joined the church. However I find that I am extremely uncomfortable during bible study or services when they ask you to confess to being a sinner, that Jesus died for your sins, that Satan is real, hell is real, etc. I find myself struggling between \"joining\" my husband at his church of choice so as not to separate our spiritual relationship, and doing what I'd like to do, which is to attend Unity Church, which provides a forum for Course students and a more 'open minded' theology. But the last thing I want to do is create separation of any kind in our marriage. Would I be abandoning my husband spiritually if I send him off to Baptist Church by himself and I go to Unity? Your advice would be greatly appreciated.",
    "output": "The seeming dilemmas of our lives are really only ever covers for the underlying conflict in our minds, which is always the same conflict--shall I judge or shall I forgive? Despite what may seem to be the compelling nature of any external situation which is calling out for resolution, its only real value is what blocks it helps us uncover within our own ego thought system that prevent us from seeing shared rather than separate interests. You seem genuinely concerned for your husband but you also seem to be torn over a sense that the choice is between your own spiritual progress and your husband's. Or, as the ego likes to put everything--it's one or the other, that is, for one of you to gain, the other must lose. And this can only ever be the ego speaking. And it is this way of perceiving the situation, rather than the situation itself, that you want to look at and bring to Jesus or the Holy Spirit for help in seeing differently. It is only the ego that ever calls for someone to sacrifice. The Course is a self-study program whose workbook lessons lead to a recognition over time that all situations and circumstances are conducive to learning to practice its principles. You have opportunities to put forgiveness into practice no matter which church you attend, or whether you attend no church at all, whenever you are with others, or whenever you are thinking about others, no matter who they are. The egos that we encounter, whether it be at the Unity Church or the Baptist Church or the grocery store, are always fundamentally the same, and we are only ever called upon to learn forgiveness, no matter what form our ego projections may appear to take. Learning to watch our own and others' egos in action, without judging, is all that Jesus ever asks of us in any situation. Now, lest you think that this is an endorsement of your attending the Baptist Church with your husband rather than Unity Church by yourself, it is also helpful to remember that joining has nothing to do with what bodies do and whether they are together or not. The only concern is with which part of the mind we are joining--the ego or the Holy Spirit--and choosing as our teacher. The joining occurs first in the mind and only then is reflected in the external relationships, which may or may not then involve bodies being together. The important thing will be for you to uncover all the judgments and investments you have in each of the alternatives you currently perceive and take those thoughts to the Holy Spirit for help. Once you have released your own investments in any particular outcome, the important healing will have happened and the external solution will be only of secondary concern. For, joined with the right teacher and free of your own perceived needs, you will be acting in whatever way is most loving, whether you end up attending the Baptist Church, the Unity Church, both churches, or neither church! For a consideration of how to be in a religious situation that you feel is inconsistent with the Course's teachings, you may find #154 helpful."

    "text_input": "Q #347: As a student of A Course in Miracles, I am finding the Christmas holiday season more and more difficult and depressing with each passing year. How do I reconcile the desire to want to take part in and be joyous and of good cheer during this time of the year which to me only seems to validate the special message and the meaning my ego has given to this season? It's like a tug of war: on the one hand wanting to make Jesus special for his \"holy birth,\" and on the other hand wanting to make me special for not wanting to take part in the holiday. I am trying not to judge the holiday but rather feel apathetic towards it. Can you help me see this differently?",
    "output": "As our understanding of the Course deepens, we begin to see the meaninglessness of the world's values and beliefs, including those most \"sacred,\" such as Christmas. To the ego this is depressing, for the ego wants nothing more than to have \"divine\" validation. What greater proof that the world is real and we are in it, than to have God send His Son into the world to redeem it? Challenging this belief, therefore, is extremely threatening to the ego. The conflict you describe is very common, and is inevitable as long as meaning is sought in the meaningless. If the Christmas holiday celebration were not endowed with any \"holy\" significance (it has none), nor seen as any different from other simple pleasures one may enjoy in the world, there would be no need to respond to it any differently than an enjoyable day at the beach. Engaging in the activities of the season is not the problem, and being apathetic to them is not the solution. It is the desire that the ego's insanity be true, and that salvation be found in the multitude of substitutes made up specifically to exclude God and deny truth, that reinforces guilt and causes the conflict you describe. Learning this is a process, and Christmas is a perfect classroom in which to recognize the deep investment we have in defending our identity as bodies and proving we are right. Thinking we are bodies in the world, and that Christmas, among many other things, will make us happy, is what actually makes us deeply miserable. Our true hope lies in accepting that we do not know who we are, nor what will make us happy. We may then be willing to accept the Holy Spirit's definition of Who we are as God's one Son, and find happiness in knowing our true Identity. In themselves, the gifts, lights, and symbols of Christmas made by the ego to glorify specialness are nothing. In fact, Jesus uses many of these same symbols in the Course to teach us the opposite of the ego's message of separation and specialness. The mistake is believing they themselves have the power to make us truly happy or give us the peace we seek. It is this belief that causes the distress you describe. Hope for a peaceful holiday lies in the willingness to look at these illusory beliefs, without judging them as anything but illusory. We give ourselves a true gift when we do what Jesus tells us: \"This Christmas give the Holy Spirit everything that would hurt you\" (T-15.XI.3:1). What hurts us is identifying with the ego thought system. \"It's the thought that counts\" is a common refrain in reference to holiday gift giving. It applies aptly here since it is indeed our mistaken thoughts that are transformed when given to the Holy Spirit, thereby bringing us immense relief from the madness of the ego's lies. It is thus possible to take part in the holiday celebration, seeing it as yet another classroom to learn the Holy Spirit's lessons of forgiveness rather than to reinforce the ego's specialness. In this spirit we can find peace this Christmas season, while participating in the celebrations in whatever way seems fitting."

    "text_input": "Q #348: I first discovered A Course in Miracles in San Diego ten years ago, and I believe was initially drawn to California due to what I perceive as an incredible spiritual energy. It's been approximately two years since I moved to a mid-western state, and although I know on an intellectual level that my sense of peace and connectedness to God has nothing to do with where I am, I cannot seem to get over the fact that since moving away from California, I can't find the same sense of spiritual awareness, closeness to God, and peace that I felt while there. Could it be that this so-called \"connectedness\" that I felt in San Diego was yet another ego tactic that was easy to find in such a vibrant place, or could it be that San Diego truly is where I belong?",
    "output": "You are correct in saying that your peace has nothing to do with your location. Where you happen to be living neither gives you peace nor takes it away. Nor is a geographical area imbued with spiritual energy. The only \"place\" where we get in touch with our true nature as spirit is in the mind. Therefore, if you are not feeling at peace in your new home it cannot be due to your surroundings. It is a reflection of the loss of peace experienced as the result of a decision to leave your real home. The guilt for having \"run away\" from God is the source of the feelings of sadness and loss you are experiencing. Needless to say, in this dream of exile it is very normal for us to develop a special relationship with a geographical area that we love, and that suits us. It is our belief that we are incomplete that compels us to endow certain people, places, or things with the power to meet our needs in some way. When they fail us or are no longer \"ours,\" we then experience a deep sense of loss. They become our \"idols,\" taking the place (pardon the pun) of where we truly belong, i.e., at home with God: \"You are at home in God, dreaming of exile but perfectly capable of awakening to reality. Is it your decision to do so?\" (T-10.I.2:1-2). When you feel homesick for San Diego, it is important not to deny all that you appreciate and love about it, nor to deny your feelings of loss. At the same time, you may recognize the real source of your pain and ask the Holy Spirit for the correction so that the process of healing the specialness can begin. Only in this way will the sadness and loss gradually dissolve."

    "output": "The Course will, perhaps to your disappointment, not tell you what to do to get rid of your problems, but rather it will teach you how to look at them so that you may be as peaceful as you're willing to be, regardless of what seems to be happening. Now that does not mean that you won't make any effort or take specific steps to resolve the problems, just as any \"normal\" human being might. By all means, determine the best way to take care of yourself and your body. But wouldn't it be preferable to proceed without a sense of urgency, fear or anxiety? Now that will more than likely take time to achieve, and patience is one of the characteristics of an advanced teacher of God (M-4.VIII)! So don't get discouraged if shifts in your perception do not happen as quickly as you think you'd like them to. You may wish to have a focus on developing a relationship with your inner teacher--Jesus, the Holy Spirit, or whatever you're comfortable with calling that presence--which the workbook lessons should be helping to facilitate. For developing that relationship in your mind can go a long way towards offering you the comfort of knowing, as you address your life challenges, that there is Someone who genuinely cares for you Who is always available to you so that you know you are never alone. To get an idea of how questions raising some concerns parallel to the ones you have identified have been addressed, you may wish to review Questions #128, #142, #229, #235, and #313."

That would mean that there could not have been a \"dreamer to dream any dream\" nor could there have been any separation from God (through any autonomous desire to create ourselves) because there was nothing else. God would have had to be the dreamer and, thus, He would have had to separate from Himself.

After months of struggle this was revealed to me a few days ago. Please let me have your thoughts!",

What makes such issues ultimately impossible to address satisfactorily is that we are attempting to make sense of an illusory state from within that illusory state. It's enough to make you crazy, but we already are, for believing we're in that illusory state. Only a split mind can have a question, for within perfect Oneness, there can be nothing that is unknown, hidden or forgotten. And \"anything outside of the eternal\" can only be nothing, although we make much ado about it. To say that an illusion is an illusion is to operate still within the illusion, but it has the advantage of not perpetuating further illusion. That, in a nutshell, is what forgiveness is (C-3.1:3-4).

    "text_input": "Q #351: Regarding the phrase, \"The memory of God comes to a quiet mind,\" which \"mind\" is this referencing? If it's the \"brain mind\" we use in the daily dream, does this mean that it is helpful to find and use ways to try to quiet the brain, for example, meditation? If the phrase refers to the one Mind, how is it possible to \"quiet\" that Mind through the interference of our \"Brahmanic\"?",
    "output": "The mind A Course in Miracles refers to here is the right mind, not the brain. This mind is quiet. It is only when the mind chooses to identify with the thought of separation that awareness of the memory of God is blocked and the quiet is replaced by the ego's \"raucous shrieking.\" The Course tells us that the purpose of the ego's shrieks is to keep us anchored in its thought system, unaware that we have a mind at all, much less a quiet one. Meditation may be helpful to keep us focused on our goal, and there are several meditative exercises in the workbook to help us. However, neither meditation in itself nor quieting the brain is the means the Course uses to bring about the mind's healing of the thought of separation. It is asking us to look at the thoughts, beliefs, and feelings that flood into our awareness from the mind through our brains, not to try to silence them: \"Our task is but to continue, as fast as possible, the necessary process of looking straight at all the interference and seeing it exactly as it is\" (T-15.IX.2:1). The beliefs we hold about ourselves as separate, sinful and guilty, and our attack thoughts that are projections of our guilt onto others keep the awareness of God's Love blocked. They have been purposefully chosen in defense of the decision to be separate, and must be recognized as the cause of all the devastating effects we experience in the ego's nightmare. Looking in this way leads us to question the value we place on our beliefs: \"To learn this course requires willingness to question every value that you hold. Not one can be kept hidden and obscure but it will jeopardize your learning. No belief is neutral. Every one has the power to dictate each decision you make\" (T-24.in.2:1-4). We will eventually learn that our beliefs have no value; only then will we be free to let them go so they can be replaced by the thoughts of the Holy Spirit Who brings healing to our minds. This healed mind is the quiet mind where the memory of God returns to awareness."

I feel neither the ego's pleasure nor the peace of the Holy Spirit. I really do feel of two minds and my decision as to which one to follow feels random and confusing.

I have felt genuine gratitude for the events in my life, even though from a cultural perspective, I may appear not to have much going for me at this time. I am now sinking into a depression over externals and am afraid of being stuck there. I could use some advice.",
    "output": "The Course assures us that it can be a gentle path (e.g., T-6.V.2:1; T-14.IX.3:2; T- 15.XI.1:5,6; T-19.IV-A.11:6; T-21.I.3:1,2). However, our egos, frightened of the prospect of losing control and being dissolved in love, seem determined to allow the process to be anything but gentle. For the ego thrives on gravity and seriousness and would never want us to take its antics lightly. Know that you are not alone in the struggle you are experiencing. You speak of feeling that you are of two minds, with your choice between them as random and confusing. One helpful step in your process may be to understand what the Course is calling us to do when it asks us to choose between those two minds--the ego and the Holy Spirit. For most of us, for much of the time, and certainly especially when we are first embarking on this journey, choosing the Holy Spirit will mean very simply learning to look at our ego and all its ugliness without judging it. We are not being asked to deny it, for we still believe it's real. But if we can look at the ego very honestly, without judging it, it will begin to lose some of its seeming power. Rather than overwhelming, it will begin to appear merely pathetic, even silly. And we will begin increasingly to recognize that our ego does not really make us all that different from everyone else. We all share its insanity and if we feel ashamed of it, it can only be because we are denying that commonality with all our brothers and sisters. Now obviously, this looking is not something we can do on our own, as you are experiencing. For when we look on our own, which really means looking with our ego--the ego, by definition, is what it means to be on our own--the result can only be pain and despair. They are the ego's defense against our decision to become willing to lighten up with the help of Jesus or the Holy Spirit. Jesus has asked us to join with him in the process of looking at our egos (e.g., T-11.V.1) because without that gentle presence alongside us, we can only deceive ourselves into believing the horror of what we see in ourselves. Yet Jesus simply smiles at all of it, and perhaps that is why we hesitate turning to him, for we may not be ready to have our egos, while we remain so intimately identified with them, dismissed so lightly. It is also good to remember that there is no need to force the process, no need to insist on looking more deeply when our fear is too great, for then we only succeed in frightening ourselves, another of the ego's goals to keep itself alive and kicking. In Jesus' own gentle, undemanding words, \"If you find resistance strong and dedication weak, you are not ready. Do not fight yourself\" (T-30.I.1:6-7). Depression is yet one more weapon in the ego's arsenal of defenses against the truth about Who we really are. The Course attributes depression to the fact that we are trying to learn an impossible curriculum -- finding happiness on the ego's terms (T-8.VII.8). Yet while we are caught in its downward spiral, it may be that seeking support from others, such as a gentle, accepting therapist, can provide the helping hand we need to pull ourselves out of the quicksand of ego judgments. If you find yourself sinking in your interpretations of your life situation, by all means please consider looking for someone who can help you find a different way of dealing with your circumstances. Again, what is important is to recognize that you are not alone. It can only be your ego that wants you to believe that you are alone and trapped, and the ego is capable only of lies. You may find some additional thoughts that could be of help to you in your situation in Questions #95 and #313."

I have been told several times  that once it is revealed to me, my whole life will just fall into place! I would appreciate your input.",
    "output": "From the point of view of A Course in Miracles, your purpose is to practice forgiveness in every area of your life, so that you would awaken from the dream that you have a life and a will separate from God, your Source. The Course is not about success or fulfillment in the world, because it teaches us that the world was made to hide our true purpose and therefore to prevent us from ever experiencing the happiness that is our inheritance as God's Son. On the other hand, the Course is not against pursuing a career or being successful in a role in the world. For example, it is especially important for young people just out of school to devote themselves to their work and relationships. It is not usually helpful for young people starting out in life to be confronted with the idea that the world is a defense against the truth. That should come later when a deeper level of questioning comes naturally from within themselves. The Course's view actually is quite liberating in the sense that you can fulfill your special function of forgiveness in any role, in any career, at any time, and in any place, because it has to do only with the content in your mind, not the form your life takes (T-25.VI). You thus can view your life as a classroom that presents one opportunity after another to recognize whether you have chosen the ego or Jesus as your teacher, and then to make another choice if you discover you have chosen the ego. You would know which one you have chosen by your experience. With Jesus or the Holy Spirit guiding you, you would see your interests as less and less in conflict with others, which means that you would realize that you share the same wrong mind and the same right mind with everyone else. You would be more inclined to relate to yourself and others in the context of sharing the same needs and dynamics of the ego and the same attraction to undoing separation. Growing into this way of relating to others is your function. The lessons in the workbook, combined with study of the text, are designed to facilitate this training."

I see it as a cast aside useless balloon that we choose to pick up, infuse it with the life of our magnificent minds and give it instructions to play havoc with our lives, bodies, relationships and circumstances. Is my assessment of the ego, and our total responsibility for its employment in our affairs correct and in keeping with the teachings of A Course in Miracles?",
    "output": "Yes, your assessment is very much in keeping with the Course's teachings. It is very simple, not complicated at all. As Kenneth once said: we keep betting on a horse that dropped dead at the starting gate. The problem is that we have constructed many layers of defenses to prevent ourselves from ever getting to this point of clarity, and especially of remembering that there is an alternative for us to choose. A major thrust of the Course, therefore, is to help us identify the nature of those defenses and how they operate in our lives. The purpose of our choosing the ego thought system is also a key consideration; and that purpose, of course, is so that we can have our own special lives, apart from perfect oneness. \"By definition, an illusion is an attempt to make something real that is regarded as of major importance, but is recognized as being untrue. The mind therefore seeks to make it true out of its intensity of desire to have it for itself. Illusions are travesties of creation; attempts to bring truth to lies. Finding truth unacceptable, the mind revolts against truth and gives itself an illusion of victory\" (M-8.2:3-6). Knowing intellectually that it is erroneous and totally illusory is a major step; but the integration of that understanding into our experience is where the hard work comes in, because integral to this thought system that we have allowed to program our thinking and behavior is the terrifying threat of annihilation if we change our minds about its validity and then choose a different thought system. That is why we need to develop a relationship with an internal Teacher who stands outside that entire thought system and who sees us as we truly are. That is why there is A Course in Miracles."

    "text_input": "Q #355: I have been a devoted student of A Course in Miracles (as well as Ken Wapnick) for the past 10 years; I truly try to live my life by its principles. For the past 4-5 years I have been living in what I can only describe as \"mental hell\". My mind is constantly filled with terror, a fear of impending doom and extreme anxiety. Since my external world is relatively problem-free, I do not even have anything onto which to project this terror. How do I deal with living in this \"circle of fear\"?",
    "output": "The terror, when it has us in its grip, can seem almost palpable. And it is in the ego's complete self-interest to convince us that the terror is inescapable, no matter what we may know intellectually about its origins and the process of release. Not to underestimate or minimize the intensity of what has been your experience for the past four or five years, but the ego would prefer nothing more than to have you believe that terror has been your only experience. In other words, the ego is invested in the denial of any right-minded experiences you may have been having during this seemingly bleak period. Discouragement and despair are just as effective weapons in the ego's arsenal as anger and hate, for they are all simply various forms of the same underlying content of guilt, screeching that the separation is real. While it is certainly true that our responsibility is to uncover and acknowledge the darkness within our minds so it can be released, that does not mean we should overlook or negate the experiences of light that offer the correction for the darkness, brief as they may at times seem. Do not deny them, for it is in their acknowledgment that the lifeline to peace is reinforced in your awareness. It may at first seem like the most fragile thread, barely to be trusted to bear the weight of your heavy guilt as you try to climb out of your self-imposed quagmire. But as you recognize and accept those fleeting episodes of peace, the thread becomes a string, the string a cord, the cord a rope, and the rope a ladder of forgiveness that you can climb, confidently and sure-footedly, one step at a time, until you reach the top, rising above the \"circle of fear,\" the quicksand of guilt, and the abyss of despair. And never forget the gentle hand that is always outstretched to help you with each step, for this is a climb you need not make on your own, nor can you. And that hand may come in a form you least expect, as a brother who offers you another opportunity to remember the truth about the both of you. You do not indicate that the anxiety and terror are so disabling that they disrupt your functioning in the world. Nevertheless, there is nothing in the Course that says you should not seek help from outside yourself, in the form of a kind and supportive therapist who can help you uncover any of the symbols of terror that are buried in your mind, still exerting a strong unconscious effect on your recognition that you deserve to be happy and at peace. The journey is not an easy one through the heart of darkness, but your vigilance and perseverance will be paid off increasingly in a light-heartedness that will surprise you. You need only be open to it and it will be yours. Do not forget that although patience may be a characteristic of an advanced teacher of God (M- 4.VIII), it nevertheless is a quality we can all begin to acquire now."

    "text_input": "Q #356: I have seen in print A Course in Miracles referred to as \"a Christian teaching.\" It is not, of course. However, I am hard pressed to find an appropriate adjective to describe the Course. It is a non-dualistic, psychological, philosophical, channeled teaching. Is there an easier way to say it?",
    "output": "Sometimes it is sufficient to describe the Course simply as a spiritual path that focuses on peace and forgiveness. Often, that is enough. If people want to know more than that, they will ask, and then you can expand as much as is appropriate. You could add, for example, that it is not a religion; there are no rituals and no clergy; it is a course of individual study and practice that helps us to remember God through forgiveness. If you are asked whether it is Christian, in addition to saying that it is not a religion, etc., you might say that there are many biblical terms in the Course, but they have a very different meaning, not the traditional meaning as presented in the Bible--expanding, again, as appropriate. Depending on the questions and those who are asking, you can then get into the psychological and metaphysical dimensions of the Course, and how it came."

    "text_input": "Q #357: Can you clarify what Kenneth means in The 50 Miracle Principles when he says that my \"gift of peace will be given to the other person; whether that person chooses to accept this is between that person and Jesus.\" What if the other person I am working with is not a student of A Course in Miracles, and not in touch at all with their hidden love? Implicit in this question is my frustration and fear concerning the fact that I have given gifts to my ex-girlfriend with whom I had a bad breakup. I am seeing her less and less through the eyes of fear and more and more through the eyes of love, but I have not gotten the response that I had hoped for. I am confused about the meaning of: \"As you begin to recognize the gifts you have so freely given your brother\" and I have and I am growing and excited; but I guess my dream is for her to come up to me and say \"Oh by the way I experienced this new way of looking at you.\" (LOL) Can you offer me a little insight here?",
    "output": "The distinction between form and content is important when working with these teachings. The \"gift of peace\" comes from the decision you make in your mind not to see your interests as apart from your girlfriend's. That is the content. It is no different from the \"gift of peace\" you give to anyone else. It means rising above specialness, which always involves separate interests: seeing yourself as lacking and seeing the other person as having what you want and need. Once you rise above specialness--if only for an instant--the separation between you and the other person will be gone; you will be at peace; and your experience will be that that peace enfolds you and the other person as one. In that instant all needs and expectations simply disappear; it truly does not matter whether the other person responds or not. The form or expression of the content would vary from individual to individual, but that is not what is important. That is the ideal that we want to grow into. A lesson that is helpful in this context is \"When I am healed I am not healed alone\" (W-pI.137). From the world's point, the purpose of the relationship is to get what you want--to have your girlfriend in your life so that you will feel complete and fulfilled. It is natural to feel that everything will be wonderful if only your girlfriend would respond the way you want her to. That is how we approach relationships in the world. But that approach is coming from our wrong minds--which does not make it sinful or bad, nor does it mean that you should not pursue a romantic relationship. If you are working with the Course, you just want to be completely honest about the purpose of the relationship for you now; then ask for help if you would like the relationship to have a different purpose. From the Holy Spirit's point of view, the purpose of any relationship is to be the means by which we undo our own belief in separation. It is a process that takes place in our own minds. \"The Holy Spirit, ever practical in His wisdom, accepts your dreams and uses them as means for waking. You would have used them to remain asleep. I said before that the first change, before dreams disappear, is that your dreams of fear are changed to happy dreams. That is what the Holy Spirit does in the special relationship. He does not destroy it, nor snatch it away from you. But He does use it differently, as a help to make His purpose real to you. The special relationship will remain, not as a source of pain and guilt, but as a source of joy and freedom. It will not be for you alone, for therein lay its misery. As its unholiness kept it a thing apart, its holiness will become an offering to everyone\" (T-18.II.6). This, obviously, is quite different from the world's approach, where our focus is on making our lives in the world better. This shift in our approach to everything is the object of the training in the workbook lessons. It takes a long time for most of us, because it seems to go against what has become natural to us. It seems normal to think that we will be just fine as soon as the external condition changes--as soon as this particular person responds the way I want her to. But Jesus is teaching us that this attitude simply reinforces our problem rather than solving it. It reinforces our belief in the reality of our lack and our anguish and unhappiness. Again, that does not mean that you cannot have a relationship. It means that the purpose would be different."

    "text_input": "Q #358: It has been two years since I started to study A Course in Miracles and, though I was really scared in the beginning, I've kept going in spite of all my fears. Some days when I'm feeling guilty, everything seems to go wrong and I just want to die. I realize I am being egotistic, but I'm such a drama queen. I stay in deep depression for hours feeling sorry for myself, playing the martyr, thinking of how the person I feel guilty about will feel guilty after my death. I always find my way back to peace because that is what I really want. But why do I behave like such a spoiled little girl? What can I do to stop this insane \"my way or the highway\" behavior?",
    "output": "Ah, yes, \"Death seems an easy price, if they can say, 'Behold me, brother, at your hand I die!'\" (T-27.I.4:6). The ego is really the king (or queen) of drama, and we all deserve Tony's for our so very convincing performances as victims of the world, day after day after day, ad nauseum. If nothing else, we have convinced ourselves of the parts we're playing, although we may be getting more suspicious that things are not as we have imagined them to be. You have made a big step by being honest with yourself in identifying what your ego is up to, without trying to justify it. The goal, however, is not to put an end to the drama, for that would give the events of our lives a role in dictating how we feel that they simply do not have. They are only ever external cues that point to an inner choice to continue to identify with the conflict and guilt of the ego thought system rather than the peace of the Holy Spirit's alternative, and then to project responsibility for the effects of that choice outside ourselves onto someone else. It is within our own minds that the change needs to happen. And it begins by looking nonjudgmentally on our choice for the ego and the accompanying consequences, the desire to keep ourselves separate from everyone else, beginning with God, Whom we believe we sent packing when we decided we wanted our way at any cost. We behave like spoiled little children because we still identify with the ultimate spoiler, the ego, which has actually convinced us that we could spoil the perfection of God's heaven and make an impermanent world in which everything will in the end spoil. Jesus assures us that this is all insanity, but we stubbornly cling to our false identities, convinced that a miserable false identity is better than no separate individual identity at all. So continue looking at what your ego is up to, acknowledging the effect it has on you when you choose to align your thinking with it, and you will find that its appeal will simply fade over time. For the ego can only continue to exert its control in the dark, as we willingly agree to continue to fool ourselves about what it is up to. But as its agenda of guilt and pain and blame becomes increasingly clear through our nonjudmental looking with Jesus or the Holy Spirit, the choice against conflict and guilt, and hence for peace and guiltlessness, will become simpler and simpler to make."

    "text_input": "Q #359: I have a friend who thinks that I am in love with him even though he knows that I have a spouse and children. I do have affection for him because he has helped me to learn how to get myself through some trying times. Perhaps he has misunderstood my affection; I don't know. I feel very discouraged and tempted to start anew somewhere else.  I have this nagging feeling that this relationship mirrors a recurring pattern in my life: a real ambivalence toward joining with anyone, as A Course in Miracles defines joining. I seem to create relationships in which I can eventually justify pushing the other person away, both emotionally and physically, while at the same time I have a need to be liked by the person. I'm assuming that these attributes of mine are just two more forms of self-hatred--and complicated forms at that. In a recent, similar question (#180), you advised a student to focus on healing the underlying guilt in her mind that her unrequited \"love\" relationship had uncovered, and that once she had accomplished the healing, her uncertainty over the relationship would dissipate.  Can I assume that the answer to my dilemma might be the same as for the student in #180?",
    "output": "Yes, although the form of the relationship you describe is different from the relationship described in the earlier question, the content, as well as the solution, is no different. In fact, it's always the same! The recurring pattern you identify in your relationships reflects an ambivalence that necessarily characterizes all ego-based relationships. The problem is not ever the form of the relationship but the purpose that we give it--to reinforce our belief in separation and guilt-- although of course we keep that purpose hidden from ourselves. The following passage from early in the Course describes quite explicitly our self-hatred, and its origins in our ego's denial of God, as the dynamic that underlies all our relationships in the world: \"You who identify with your ego cannot believe God loves you. You do not love what you made [the ego] and what you made does not love you. Being made out of the denial of the Father, the ego has no allegiance to its maker. You cannot conceive of the real relationship that exists between God and His creations because of your hatred for the self you made. You project onto the ego the decision to separate, and this conflicts with the love you feel for the ego because you made it. No love in this world is without this ambivalence, and since no ego has experienced love without ambivalence the concept is beyond its understanding. Love will enter immediately into any mind that truly wants it, but it must want it truly. This means that it wants it without ambivalence, and this kind of wanting is wholly without the ego's 'drive to get'\" (T-4.III.4; italics added). In other words, if God our Source is only Love but we seek to be something other than a part of that Love, we are choosing against the love that we are and must believe that we have deprived ourselves of it. The ego self we make as a replacement for God and our true Self must therefore be the opposite of love, or hate. Although we are attracted to what we have made because it is our own, we also blame it for the loss of love we feel. And so any \"love\" within the ego thought system of separation must be an ambivalent combination of attraction and hatred. Since we identify with the ego, this is really self-hatred. Finding this self-hatred intolerable, we make up a world and separate brothers to hold responsible for the lack of love we feel. And then we search for that love in others, at the same time blaming them for taking it from us and depriving us of what we insist we rightfully deserve, denying all the time that it was our own choice that brought us to this sorry situation. All relationships in the world, whether they involve a romantic component or not, must have this ambivalent dynamic, so long as we continue to choose the ego--the belief in the reality of the separation--as our guide and teacher. For they are always predicated on the assumption that something is missing in me and must be found outside of me. But it is inevitable that the other will fail in the end to meet my needs. And so there seems to be no alternative but to terminate this relationship and go in search of another, hoping that perhaps the next one will be the one that really works. But it never will. For the ego's maxim, that underlies all its efforts, is \"Seek, but do not find\" (T-16.V.6:5). Love need not be found nor earned nor seized--in fact, it cannot be. It can only be remembered. And we remember it by wanting it truly, which means we want nothing else--none of the special trappings of the ego, which are all nothing more than disguised guilt. We must relinquish \"the drive to get,\" whatever form it takes, including the need to be liked or valued or appreciated. But before we can relinquish the ego's seeking, we must look honestly at what it involves and acknowledge what the underlying content really is--loss, anger and attack--or we will not be willing to release it and in fact will feel like we are being compelled to sacrifice something we want and need. And so the problem is always guilt, or self-hatred, and the solution is always uncovering that inner seeming blight so that, through joining with Jesus or Holy Spirit--the reflected Presence of love in our minds--its unreality can be recognized. For if love is there with us looking on our judgment against ourselves for turning our backs on love and attacking it, then the case against ourselves can simply be dismissed (T-5.VI.10). In those moments when we accept the healing, we can be a reminder to others--those with whom we are in various relationships--that they too can make the same choice to look within rather than to seek outside themselves. And it will not be the words we speak but simply the unambivalent love and acceptance that flow through us-- love that neither looks for nor demands anything from anyone--that will remind them and reinforce that recognition within us."

    "text_input": "Q #360: Is the following correct?  If the ego does not exist and this world is of the ego, then logically speaking, this submission to the Foundation's Question and Answer Service is not really happening either, except in a dream or illusion. And if I, the writer of this submission, do not exist except as a character in a dreamer's dream, and God is Mind, and God is All That Is, then all of this world and all of its inhabitants are the entire cast of characters in this dream of God's.",
    "output": "You're in good company with Hindu teachings, which also speak of the world as God's dream. But A Course in Miracles takes a very different position on the origins and nature of the illusory world, derived from its totally uncompromising non-dualistic metaphysics. The Course teaches that once you seem to have a thought of separation, you are outside of the Mind of God, which is total Oneness. Consciousness, perception and dreams, all predicated on the reality of a self and other, are outcomes of a thought of separation that has never happened and so are also outside the Mind of God. They are all illusory and only God is real, so they cannot be contained within His reality--nor ours, as His undifferentiated Son (even our words here betray the limits of our ego framework for discussing any of this, for we seem to have slipped into a dualistic description of our reality in God). The thought of separation and the dream that follows from it to protect and defend its existence have nothing whatsoever to do with God. However, once believing in the illusion, we have two ways of looking at it: 1) as proof that we have wrested a separate existence from God at his expense, or 2) as a dream from which we need the help of the sane part of our split mind to awaken. For even within our split (separate) mind, we carry the memory of Who we really are as a part of that Oneness, which enables us to use the illusory symbols of the world for a purpose other than separation and its concomitants of sin, guilt and fear. And that purpose is forgiveness, the release of all the judgments of the ego, which will transform our perception of the world from one of separate interests to one of shared interests. And so you are correct in describing your experience as a writer and submitter of questions to the Question and Answer Service as all part of the illusory dream, but it has nothing to do with God. Yet your purpose can be one of acquiring true or healed perception, still illusory but not reinforcing the belief in illusions. And that is a necessary step before you can return to the total abstraction of knowledge--the Course's term for our reality with God in Heaven--beyond all perception and dreams."

    "text_input": "Q #361: One of my favorite passages from A Course in Miracles is \"To forgive is merely to remember all the loving thoughts you gave in the past and those that were given you ...ALL THE REST MUST BE FORGOTTEN.\" Sorry but I can't tell you where it is found in the text. I would like your comment on this passage. I have never heard anyone else mention it... maybe I'm missing something ... and I wouldn't want to do that!! Maybe the \"merely\" doesn't really mean \"merely\" ... maybe my approach should be more complex ... anyway ... it's a beautiful passage ... !",
    "output": "This passage is from \"Shadows of the Past\" (T-17.III.1:1-2). This is the heart of the forgiveness process. There is a parallel passage occurring earlier in the text: \"Do not, then, be deceived in your brother, and see only his loving thoughts as his reality, for by denying that his mind is split you will heal yours\" (T-11.VIII.9:2). The practice of this is not easy because of the investment we all have in seeing other people as the cause of our problems. As a result, our resistance to complete forgiveness will be quite strong, or in our zeal to be holy and spiritual, we will simply cover over all the pain and hurt inside so that we will see only what is loving in ourselves and others. The pain and hurt remain, though, and forgiveness then is not sincere. This is a process requiring complete honesty and patience with ourselves, and asking for help to look at how tempting it is to hold on to grievances and to blame others for our distress. That is why Jesus says \"Do not, then, be deceived in your brother ... \" He knows that we have been deceived because we see ourselves as the innocent victims of others' wickedness or viciousness. So we must first look at this tendency within ourselves, recognize where it is coming from, and then ask for help to be guided by the Teacher of forgiveness."

    "text_input": "Q #362: The workbook of A Course in Miracles says \"forgiveness looks, and waits, and judges not.\" I understand the looking and the not judging, but what exactly are we waiting for?",
    "output": "This is a way of saying that we will awaken from the dream when we no longer are afraid of letting go of the false self we made, and are ready to accept back our true Identity as the one Son of God. Our fear is so great that we progress towards awakening through instants of forgiveness; but these are quickly followed by fear of what total forgiveness means for us. So the gentleness of forgiveness is expressed through patiently accepting where we are, and not being hard on ourselves when we find ourselves right back in the thick of the ego's insanity."

    "text_input": "Q #363: I see some profound similarities between A Course in Miracles and Advaita Vedanta philosophy. Both state that this world (the physical universe) is an illusion, or, in Hindi, \"maya.\" However, in Vedanta philosophy there is a strong emphasis on karma (action), which would be the Western equivalent of sin if the karma is \"negative.\" In other words, we reap what we sow. I was very comfortable with this doctrine for many years, as it made logical sense to me ... until  the Course. Now it seems that even the belief in karma is an illusion, according to the Course's metaphysics. Do I have to completely deny everything regarding this temporal experience? No matter how intellectually satisfying the Course is in the abstract, I have a hard time with it on a day-to-day basis. Any solutions?",
    "output": "The desire to believe in karma, in particular bad or negative karma, is the desire to make sin real, in particular, the sins of others, whom we still believe should face the music for their sinfulness, even if it is nothing more than an impersonal universe meting out its \"impartial justice\" for violations and transgressions against its natural laws--the seemingly inevitable and unavoidable consequences of hate and attack. This is always the ego's version of justice, because sin has a price that must be paid and the scales of justice must always be balanced between good and evil, clearly a dualistic proposition based on a belief in opposites. Yet this can only be a desirable governing principle if we genuinely believe that others are separate from us and that you can merit punishment while I maintain my innocence. And so this is nothing more than the ego's veiled desire that guilt be real--especially others' guilt. Yet if my brothers' guilt is merely the projection of my own unconscious guilt, then I am unconsciously saying I want my own guilt to continue to be real. What if I really knew that the only way I can be let off the hook for my own so-called sins is to be willing to see that every \"transgression\"-- others' as well as my own--has been nothing more than a call for help? Clearly, this is something that, as you are experiencing, is impossible to do on your own as you realize you are being called to move beyond the Course's theoretical principles to its actual application in your life through the practice of forgiveness. And it will continue to be impossible so long as we continue to believe that our interests can be separate from anyone else's. The Course is never asking that we deny our temporal experience in the world, but it is asking us if we are willing to question our interpretation of that experience. The ego's interpretation will always see separate interests and demand \"justice\" that rights every so-called wrong, rather than questioning the premise that insists that every wrong is a sin. Of course, the bottom line is that karma and guilt are merely different ways of attempting to say that the separation is real in order to keep my individuality intact. And that is why the resistance to the Course's gentle correction for all mistakes--our own and others'--is so difficult to accept. \"The miracle minimizes the need for time\" (T-1.II.6:1), but our egos can continue to exist only in time. Karma is the world's law of cause and effect, asserting that cause is real and has real effects and so it will take time to reverse or undo any of its effects. Sin thus calls for suffering to undo the transgression. This means that time is required for eventual release to be earned-- some time in the future, if not in this lifetime then in some future lifetime. But the effect of the miracle is now, in a holy instant outside of time and space, transcending the laws of the physical world and its underlying ego laws. In Jesus' own gentle and reassuring words: \"How foolish and insane it is to think a miracle is bound by laws that it came solely to undo! The laws of sin have different witnesses with different strengths. And they attest to different sufferings. Yet to the One Who sends forth miracles to bless the world, a tiny stab of pain, a little worldly pleasure, and the throes of death itself are but a single sound; a call for healing, and a plaintive cry for help within a world of misery. It is their sameness that the miracle attests. It is their sameness that it proves. The laws that call them different are dissolved, and shown as powerless. The purpose of a miracle is to accomplish this. And God Himself has guaranteed the strength of miracles for what they witness to. Be you then witness to the miracle, and not the laws of sin. There is no need to suffer any more (T-27.VI.6:3-11; 7:1-2)."

    "text_input": "Q #364: If I am spirit and my body is not real is it wrong to feed it well, exercise it, have it massaged, dress it with care, make it up, etc., or is all this seen as being gentle with myself as long as I perceive myself as being a body? Will these activities not reinforce this false idea?",
    "output": "The activities of feeding and exercising your body, having it massaged, dressing it with care, and using cosmetics are neither holy nor unholy in themselves. It would not advance you spiritually simply to stop doing things just because they make you feel good. These kinds of bodily activities contradict your desire to awaken from the dream of separation only if your motivation is connected to specialness in some way or to keep the body at the center of your attention. The idea is to discern whether you are using your body to make yourself different and special (the ego's purpose) or to learn that we are all the same as fragments of the one Son of God, sharing both the same wrong-minded thoughts of the ego and the same right-minded thoughts of the Holy Spirit. Our attitude towards our bodies, thus, should be centered on using them so as to uncover the hidden agenda of separation that we are constantly upholding in our minds. It is because of that hidden agenda that Jesus at one point refers to the body as \"the engine of destruction\" (T-20.VIII.4:8). That is the original purpose of the body. On the metaphysical level, the level of absolute truth, A Course in Miracles teaches us that the body was made to attack and replace our true Identity, and to limit love (T-18.VIII.1). (An impossibility, and therefore totally illusory of course.) So on that level, anything we do to our bodies supports that purpose. But since we are not yet ready to identify completely with that truth, Jesus prepares us to move in that direction by having us first regard the body as neutral (W-pII.294). In this sense, our bodily lives are classrooms in which we gradually learn to recognize which teacher we have chosen to guide our activities--the ego or the Holy Spirit. Therefore, we don't change our bodies or how we fix them up, etc., but rather we change the purpose we have given them."

    "text_input": "Q #365: What is the role of the ego of a child when he/she is tortured and/or abused by an adult?",
    "output": "First, the difference between the mind and the brain must be recognized. The brain develops, but the mind does not. The mind is always \"mature,\" we can say, and the body-brain complex is part of the ego's defensive strategy. In this sense, it can be misleading to speak of the \"ego of a child.\" If the decision-making mind (outside time and space) chooses to identify with the ego, it will be seeking to keep the separation real, but to project the sin, guilt, and fear associated with it. Its strategy is centered on shifting the battle it perceives between God and itself from the mind to specific situations in an external world, which is its motive for having a world in the first place. The ego's goal is to keep victimization outside the mind, so that it would not have to confront the fact that it is the original victimizer and sinner. (All of that is illusory, of course; but we have not yet accepted that.) One specific form this could take is the victimization of a child by an adult. In such a case, the decision-making mind splits off its identity as mind and takes on the identity of an innocent child in a relationship with an abusing adult. Thus, the ego achieves its goal of innocence, while the sin and guilt is clearly seen outside. Another ego motivation for a script containing torture and/or abuse of a child is to provide a means of atoning for the \"sin\" of attacking love. The ego has convinced the Son that punishment by God is inevitable, but that God's wrath might be tamed if the Son were to suffer in his stolen identity. It is essential to understand that this is not saying that the child is responsible for the adult's behavior, or that the child, as a child, \"asked for it.\" That is not at all what A Course in Miracles teaches. This must be seen from the perspective of the mind outside time and space, not the brain or physical existence. Nothing in the world is as it appears to be, but we have split off the part of our minds that is aware of the ego dynamics responsible for this limited awareness. The Course is the means we are using to restore to our awareness the power of our minds to choose either the ego's or the Holy Spirit's thought systems."

    "text_input": "Q #366: I have identified the fear that is keeping me from embracing the teachings of A Course in Miracles fully: I am afraid I will leave behind those I love in the dream--not only in this lifetime, but in all time. I understand this as separateness, and accept that we are all dreaming but for a moment. Yet the nagging fear I have remains and I just can't seem to get past it. Does the Course address this?",
    "output": "You are certainly not alone in experiencing this fear. For it can feel that we will have to give up all those who mean so much to us as we follow along the Course's path, forgiving and releasing our special love relationships on our return to oneness. But it can be helpful to recognize that it is merely one of the ego's deceptions that leads us to believe that we are being called upon to sacrifice what we value if we listen to the Holy Spirit (T-21.III.9:1). This mistaken belief comes from a mistaken sense of who we are, what is of value, and how the choice is made to forgive. Initially, recognizing these errors may not seem to bring us much comfort, but over time, we will begin to see all of this differently as we move beyond any perception of the possibility of loss. We think we are specific individual bodies who, in order to experience love, need relationships with other individuals who also are or have been or will be bodies. Nothing in the Course says we must give up any of this while it remains our perception. In fact, Jesus says, \"I have said repeatedly that the Holy Spirit would not deprive you of your special relationships, but would transform them. And all that is meant by that is that He will restore to them the function given them by God\" (T-17.IV.2:3-4). To understand what your ego is up to in throwing up this smokescreen to avoid committing yourself fully to the Course, it may be helpful to look at the purpose for which we have made our special love relationships, as well as the different function they can serve when we give them to the Holy Spirit, as alluded to in the above quote. In alliance with the ego, we made special love relationships as a substitute for God's Love (T-17.IV.2:7), which we believe we threw away when we chose the thought of separation from God. Consequently, it is \"natural\" that we feel-- so long as we believe we are bodies--that we are separate from love, that we find love in relationship with other bodies, and that we can be separated from those we love. None of these thoughts is a sin, but all of them serve the ego's purpose of convincing us that we are indeed separate and on our own. And although the content of these relationships seems to be love, this substitute love is really a cover over the hatred that is buried deeply in our mind. That is why we can so easily experience disappointment, frustration, irritation, annoyance, anger, and even rage at those we believe we love. The seeming love is there so long as our perceived needs are being met. Once they are threatened, the mask over the hatred comes off. Yet this does not mean that there is no real love in these relationships. It is simply buried even deeper in the mind, below the hatred. And that is the key to the Holy Spirit's purpose for our relationships--to help us get in touch first with the judgment and anger in our own mind, so that they can be released, allowing that love that has been there all along within us to flow through our mind to the minds of those with whom we are in relationship. The truth is, all relationships exist only in the mind, no matter what our experience tells us about relationships being between bodies. And the experience that we all ultimately are searching for in our external relationships is the experience of real love, with no conditions or limits. But the love can not be found outside ourselves (T-29.VII). Yet those seeming external relationships can become reminders of where to search to find the love we really desire, and where the obstacles are to that experience--in our own minds. And so, as we allow the Holy Spirit to heal all our relationships, both the special hate and the special love, we will experience, more and more of the time, the love that we yearn for. The meaning of our relationships with others will be transformed from symbols of hatred and attack to symbols of forgiveness and love. And we will use those symbols just as long as we need them, while we still believe we are separate individuals. But there will be no moving beyond our experience of relationships with others outside ourselves until we decide we are ready for that next step. In the end, when we know we and all our brothers are the love we have been seeking, we will no longer need the external symbols, for we will have accepted the experience that they have come to represent. And the love itself will be all that matters."

    "text_input": "Q #367: One of the experiences that have led me to A Course in Miracles is separation and divorce. Even though I try to bring my daily Course lesson with me throughout my day, I find myself in a pity party too often. I release whatever I'm feeling to the Holy Spirit as soon as I realize what I'm doing, but sometimes I'm not able to regain peace for quite some time--even days. This only happens with issues surrounding my ex-husband--everything else comes under control very easily. Any suggestions?",
    "output": "Releasing your feelings to the Holy Spirit really means first looking at how much you do not want to let the other person off the hook. And if you find that you cannot budge on that, then just acknowledge it in all honesty, without judging yourself in any way. That would help immensely, because you would not then be fighting against yourself, or pretending that you are forgiving when you really don't want to. Being able to accept where you are, without judging yourself for it, is where real progress is made, because you would be learning that the \"tiny, mad idea\" had no effect on reality. And that is what we are all trying to learn. Surely, though, as your experience confirms, you can never be at peace when you hold on to a grievance. So if you take that into consideration each time you feel that you just can't let go of your feelings of victimization, or whatever you are feeling, you will be reminding yourself of the cost of being right. The process, then, is to be completely honest with yourself and the Holy Spirit or Jesus, not to judge yourself, and to be aware of the cost to yourself of not forgiving. The truth of your reality as Christ never changes; but your experience and awareness of that peace and love is blocked by grievances."

    "text_input": "Q #368: I have been studying your \"Rules for Decision\" workshop for 3 weeks. My daily goal for the last week has been to learn forgiveness. I just did not understand \"Who to forgive?\" and \"What to forgive them for?\" What obstacles are in the way of my experiencing the true love that is mine? I have learned that a very deep hate is in me. I did not believe there was hate in me, until I started to analyze all my thoughts and remarks and realized that many or most of them were hate based. I have forgiven myself for this, and I believe I can forgive others, as I forgave myself. What comments and advise can you give to help me. My instinct is to erase this letter because it is all ego based. What is that all about?",
    "output": "As your experience indicates, the first step in forgiveness is the recognition of the hatefulness that permeates the ego thought system, and how it is expressed in our lives, in all our relationships. Your choice to learn forgiveness has led you to the very place where forgiveness must take place--your self. The process involves looking honestly at your thoughts and judgments, as you have been doing, and seeing them as the effect of a choice in your mind to be separate from God (and therefore all your brothers). Though we judge ourselves as sinful for this and feel guilty, A Course in Miracles tells us we are mistaken, and need to be corrected. We are asked to give these judgments to the Holy Spirit so they can be transformed. So we forgive our brothers for what they did not do, because everything we accuse them of is a projection of our own guilt: \"Be willing to forgive the Son of God for what he did not do\" (T-17.III.1:5). We also forgive ourselves for what we did not do, because neither the separation nor the guilt is real. The obstacles to experiencing love are all the beliefs we hold about ourselves as sinful, guilty, separated selves, living in bodies and deserving of God's punishment. Practice of the Course teachings leads us first to recognize these beliefs, then to question their validity and see their enormous cost: the loss of peace, and loss of the awareness of our true Identity, as well as the experience of love which you speak of. As the pain of holding on to the hatred and the beliefs in guilt becomes more and more intense, we will be more willing to let them go, and then the truth of who we are will return to awareness: \"When every concept has been raised to doubt and question, and been recognized as made on no assumptions that would stand the light, then is the truth left free to enter in its sanctuary, clean and free of guilt\" (T-31.V.17:5). The part of the mind that clings to the belief in separation resists any effort made in undoing this belief. Your decision to understand and practice forgiveness threatens the ego thought system, which explains the \"temptation\" to erase your question. Luckily you resisted the temptation, and not the choice for forgiveness."

    "text_input": "Q #369: What is the reverse of the Golden Rule (T-1.V.6:4)?",
    "output": "The reverse of the Golden Rule is the ego's norm of separate interests: I get what I want regardless of the cost to others. One of the unfortunate consequences of this approach to life and behavior is that we become suspicious of others' motivations. If that norm is embedded in our own thinking, then it must direct everyone else's thinking as well. Instead of questioning the foundation of that type of thinking, we find ways of justifying it instead, thus sustaining the ego. It is only when we question the sanity of relationships based on separate interests that we open ourselves to the Holy Spirit's healing principle of shared interests."

    "text_input": "Q #370: I've always had a problem with accepting that I truly deserve love, believing I have to earn it or pay for it. I recently married a younger man I had been helping financially, whose intentions I didn't trust for a long time. Since the wedding, I now see he is only using me. So do I have this right? I subconsciously closed a deal: love for money and security, to shut out the love of God. The evidence I now perceive, I invited in: the man I married is taking advantage of me and does not love me. This reflects a decision and a judgment I have made about myself. As Jesus says in A Course in Miracles, I am doing this to myself, and there is no exception to that rule, right? I'm engineering the whole story to stay separate: first to close a marriage and then to get out of it and be a helpless victim? I see my own manipulations, but my perceptions don't change. How do I change them? I believe I'm doing this to myself, but I don't feel it. I feel all I want is love. If I stay in this marriage and refuse to believe my perceptions of his hurtfulness, would they change so I would see my love reflected in this person? I do not know what to do.",
    "output": "While it is true that your mind has set up the situation in which you seem to find yourself-- and that means your decision-making mind outside of time and space, and not the self that you think you are here in the world--this is almost never the most helpful level on which to focus. The more practical level is to accept that both you and your husband have egos that each seek to have their needs met by making a special love bargain as the basis for the relationship. And this makes you both exactly like everyone else in the world, even though the specific terms of your negotiated agreement may look different! So don't be too hard on yourself for the choices you have made. The other thing to remember is that the Course is never going to tell you whether to remain in or leave any relationship, because from Jesus' perspective, that is never the problem. The only real concern is, for whatever relationship you seem to be experiencing in the present, who are you going to choose to be your teacher--the ego of the Holy Spirit? Or put another way, Jesus is only concerned with what is going on in your mind and not what seems to be going on in your world, since from his perspective, there is no world! Granted, that's not how you see things now, but over time, with his help, that is the direction you will be heading, as you learn not to take yourself and your mistaken decisions quite so seriously and to be gentler with yourself. So, in terms of your marriage, what does this mean and what does it not mean? You are correct in acknowledging that whatever you experience in this relationship reflects an inner decision about how you see yourself. But you want to be clear that the external situation is not the reason you have these feelings. The relationship with your husband is only a smokescreen to hide the real problem of the guilt in your own mind, the same guilt we all share over the belief we have separated from love. The problem is not that you set up a marriage in order to feel used and unloved. That is the cover to keep your focus away from the real problem in your mind. So long as your focus is on the external relationship and how that seems to be making you feel, you are continuing to accept the ego as your teacher. If your experience is one of being victimized by your partner in some way--and you do need to start with that interpretation--you will want to ask Jesus for help in recognizing that such a perception can come only from your own projected guilt--and the guilt was there before you ever entertained the idea of entering into a dysfunctional relationship with your husband. In fact, the focus on that relationship and changing your experience of it is the sure way to make sure the real problem of the guilt in your mind is never addressed. Now that does not mean that your husband is not acting from his own ego in an unloving way. And even if you heal the guilt in your own mind, that does not mean that you will simply then see him as a reflection of the love that is within you. But it will mean that you will look on him with the true perception of the Holy Spirit and you will know that your husband is either extending love or calling for it (T-12.I.3). And if he remains identified with his ego, he will be calling for love. Since you will be joined with the love inside of you, you will know that his own manipulations and attempts to meet his needs through the relationship have nothing to do with you or your own value as a child of God. And you will not need to use him to meet your own personal, ego-based need to feel loved. Bringing your decision to turn your back on love in your own mind to Jesus and being willing to offer your perception of your husband and yourself to him in exchange for his healed perception is all that you need do, acknowledging that your own has brought you only pain. And the real value of the relationship with your husband is that it has helped you uncover those buried self- accusations in your mind, if you are willing to allow Jesus to be your gentle teacher. Whether you remain in the marriage or not, your relationship with your husband need no longer be used to reinforce the guilt in your own mind. And that is the Course's path to self-acceptance and love."

    "text_input": "Q #371: In my profession I have to deal with child abuse. I understand that it is the ego that wants to see victims, pain and suffering. But does this mean that child abuse did not happen, is that what A Course in Miracles is saying? Is this abuse not real? How does right-mindedness view child abuse and what would be right professional behavior according to the Course?",
    "output": "You are getting caught in a confusion that is common for many Course students--not distinguishing between the two levels on which the Course is written. It is true that, on a metaphysical level, the Course is saying that the world and everything that seems to happen within it, including child abuse, are illusory and in reality have never happened. But what makes the Course so practical is that much of it is written at a level that acknowledges our experience in the world but provides us with a different way of looking at that experience that helps us, over time, to disengage our minds from the illusion and to remember our reality, while not denying what we seem to be observing. (You may find Questions #3 and #253 helpful for further discussion of the issue of level confusion.) And so in your professional role, it would not be helpful to anyone involved, including yourself, if you were to deny the abuse that is presented to you. In this world as we've set it up, bodies interact with other bodies, and sometimes direct physically and emotionally violent actions toward one another. And the actions can seem particularly outrageous and horrific when they are directed by an adult at a child. What the Course would ask of you is to be willing to recognize all the ways in which you may be tempted to take sides, to pass judgment or to feel pity, sadness, disgust, anger, or any other emotion that the situation may trigger in you. And then to recognize that, whatever you are feeling, you have made an interpretation and are wrong! Now judgment is unavoidable when we look at a situation like child abuse from our ego perspective of separation and guilt. For we have made the world so that we can see sin and attack outside ourselves, and situations such as these are ideal screens on which to project our guilt (e.g., T-13.IX.3:1; T-18.I.6), since nearly everyone else will agree with our interpretation. But Jesus is asking us to question our conclusions, for he knows what we do not yet know, that all the violence and pain is happening only in the mind and not in the world, and that it has nothing to do with bodies (T-28.III.4:6; 5:1; W-pI.135.9). And so, if you join with Jesus, over time you will come to recognize the pain that everyone involved in the abuse shares, and that everyone is making unconscious choices out of this pain--abuser, abused, silent accomplice, angry accuser. And if you are judging any of them, you are reacting from this same pain as well. Over time, with this growing realization, your judgments will diminish and you will feel compassion for everyone involved, regardless of their role. And you will also begin to understand that the pain is really a call for love, and the love is always there, within the mind, accessible to all of us if we are willing to release our own interpretations and accept Jesus'. For it is only our interpretations and judgments that block the love and keep differences and separation from love real in our minds. In the end, as we come to recognize that the love is always there, we will also recognize that the pain and guilt are not real (W-pII.284.1), and the abuse that seems to mask their source in the mind is unreal as well. But that realization only comes at the end of the process. And it will not mean that you necessarily behave any differently with the families you are working with. You will continue to act in ways that will help determine responsibility and appropriate consequences within the system for the abuse, as well as protect the child from further abuse--but you will do it all without judgment. And you will have become a reminder for everyone involved that there is another way of looking at what has been happening that does not involve attack and blame. The Course has nothing to say about behavior--professional or otherwise--for its concern is only with the contents of our minds. But rest assured, if you do the inner work of release as you become aware of the projections of guilt arising within your own mind, you will know how to relate to everyone in a way that can only reflect healing. And you will know that you are only ever an instrument of that healing, and never its Source."

    "text_input": "Q #372: My father is a strong practicing Christian Scientist, and we often have discussions on the differences in theology between it and A Course in Miracles. One particular aspect of these differences is the world--the Course teaching that everything in the material universe is material and not created (or even known) by God, while in Christian Science, things such as trees, streams, and mountains are ideas of God, but not matter.  I believe what it boils down to is that in Christian Science they don't believe we escape from the world because we never left perfection. It seems to me that in the Course we are trying to escape the thought system on which the world is based and don't see nature as ideas of God but as distractions of the ego thought system.  Another seeming difference in the two is that Christian Science believes that as you withdraw your belief in matter or the illusion the world of form will get better--guaranteed! Because it is all about thought. But I believe the Course's view is that form may or may not get better, even when you begin to see the unreality of it.  Can you clarify these differences for me? Also do you know of other differences in these two philosophies because at their core they sure seem the very same to me?",
    "output": "You are correct in the differences between A Course in Miracles and Christian Science that you point out. In themselves they are enough to establish that these two thought systems are fundamentally different. A Course in Miracles teaches not only that the world was not created by God, Who has no knowledge of it, but that it does not exist at all. We are not asked to escape the world or the ego thought system as such, but to learn to let go of our identity with that thought system through forgiveness (W-pI.23). You are right, the world will not get better when we no longer believe the thought of separation from God is real; it will disappear in our awareness. Since the Course teaches there is no hierarchy of illusions (T-26.VII.6), all form in the physical universe is equally unreal, no part of which is an idea of God, Who is pure spirit with and beyond form. The Course's teaching on forgiveness also distinguishes it from other spiritual paths. As you may know, it tells us: \"Be willing to forgive the Son of God for what he did not do\" (T-17.III.1:5). We are asked to live the Course by applying the process of forgiveness to all our relationships. This involves looking at the hatred, anger and judgments of the ego thought system in operation in our lives, so they can be released and replaced by the Holy Spirit's thought system. This is not central to the teaching of Christian Science. If you are a student of the Course, it may be helpful to remember that it is this application of its teachings that is important rather than the intellectual understanding of its metaphysical principles. Discussions with your father probably provide you with many opportunities for this. A Course in Miracles asks us to acknowledge all the judgments we may have during our interactions, recognize that they are projections of guilt at having chosen to identify with the thought of separation, and give them to the Holy Spirit so they can be reinterpreted. As a Christian Scientist, your father may have a very different practice. Another significant distinction is the importance of the role of Jesus and the Holy Spirit in the practice of the Course's teaching. We are encouraged to ask Jesus or the Holy Spirit for help in choosing our right minds rather than our wrong minds, so our perception can be transformed."

    "text_input": "Q #373: How is it possible for someone who seems very naive spiritually to have much more self-esteem and self-love than someone who has studied A Course in Miracles for many years? I'm speaking of one of my older siblings, a Christian. Some of the things he tells me about his religion sound silly (and even wrong sometimes) to me, and yet it's evident (I think) from his  success in life regarding work, home, family, and his warm and loving personality and the way everybody loves him (including me) that deep inside he holds himself in much higher regard than I hold myself. I'm a little jealous. In Course terms, how do I reconcile this within?",
    "output": "Well, it seems pretty apparent from what you say that God just likes your brother better. But seriously, you have fallen into a couple of common traps that the ego likes to ensnare us all in. First, you are judging by appearance or form between yourself and your brother. And secondly, you believe you can compare spiritual paths and determine that one is better, more sophisticated or more nearly correct than another. Let us consider the second issue first. While from your perspective, your brother's spiritual beliefs may seem naive, silly and even wrong, there is a good chance that, from his perspective, the Course may seem just as naive, silly and wrong. The Course makes no exclusive claim to the truth (M-1.4:1-2). We each need only be concerned that we have found the path that is right for ourselves and not worry about whether someone else's path makes sense. As Jesus says in the Course, and this would apply to various spiritual paths as well as to different people's experience with the Course: \"The curriculum is highly individualized\" (M-29.2:6). As for your brother's greater apparent self-esteem, we never know for certain what someone else's inner experience is. But self esteem is not the goal of the Course, peace is. And that peace has nothing to do with apparent success in life, according to the world's terms. A helpful passage early in the Course describes the trap you've fallen into with your brother--the ego game of judging and comparing, employing its criteria for what is of value, based on form, rather than the Holy Spirit's criteria based simply on distinguishing what is true from what is false: \"The ego ... always evaluates itself in relation to other egos....Its whole perception of other egos as real is only an attempt to convince itself that it is real. 'Self-esteem' in ego terms means nothing more than that the ego has deluded itself into accepting its reality, and is therefore temporarily less predatory. This 'self-esteem' is always vulnerable to stress, a term which refers to any perceived threat to the ego's existence. The ego literally lives by comparisons\" (T- 4.II.6:5,7-9; 7:1). Now none of this is meant to say that your brother does or does not have an experience of inner peace. But that is not your concern, for it simply becomes one more external distraction that prevents you from making the choice for peace within yourself now. And when you remember that choice, you will also remember Jesus' loving reminder to all of us who are tempted to compare ourselves to our brothers: \"The specialness of God's Sons does not stem from exclusion but from inclusion. All my brothers are special\" (T-1.V.3:5-6)."
  },
  {
    "text_input": "Q #374: According to A Course in Miracles, would it be correct to say that to forgive in any situation is the same as seeing the truth in any situation?",
    "output": "Not exactly. Truth cannot be experienced nor \"seen\" directly in the dream, because everything here is an illusion, including forgiveness: \"Forgiveness, then, is an illusion, but because of its purpose, which is the Holy Spirit's, it has one difference. Unlike all other illusions it leads away from error and not towards it\" (C.3.1:3-4). Our minds hold a memory of truth that is brought to our awareness through the process of forgiveness, it is \" ... an earthly form of love\" (W-pI.186.14:2). True forgiveness shows us the unreality of every situation and only in this sense does it reflect the truth. It enables us to perceive everything with the Holy Spirit as either a call for love or an expression of love (T-14.X.7). It thereby leads us toward the truth, which is our oneness with God as His innocent Son. Through the practice of forgiveness, all the unconscious beliefs we hold about ourselves that contradict the truth are brought to awareness so they can be given to the Holy Spirit to be transformed. When we have forgiven every thought and belief in this way, we will no longer block our awareness that: \"...truth stands radiant, apart from conflict, untouched and quiet in the peace of God\" (T-23.I.7:10)."

  {
    "text_input": "Q #375: What is the meaning of \"correction must be introduced vertically from the bottom up\" (T-1.VI.3:3)?",
    "output": "In several places in the Course, Jesus uses the metaphor of a ladder to talk about our separating from God and then the process of undoing that separation. Our choice to separate from God initiated a series of dynamics that led us all the way down to the bottom of the ladder, which is what we now experience as our selves and our lives. Our return, therefore, must begin with where we are, and then with the Jesus gently guiding us, we go back up the ladder step by step until we reach the top: \" ... salvation will proceed to change the course of every step in the descent to separation, until all the steps have been retraced, the ladder gone, and all the dreaming of the world undone ... What waits for you in perfect certainty beyond salvation is not our concern. For you have barely started to allow your first, uncertain steps to be directed up the ladder separation led you down. The miracle alone is your concern at present. Here is where we must begin\" (T-28.II.12:7; III.1:1-4). Thus the correction is focused on our present experience as bodies in a physical world. That is why we need to be vigilant about not skipping steps by denying our bodies or our physical experience in an attempt to jump from the bottom of the ladder right to the top. Any healing we would experience if we did that would be short-lived, because the underlying guilt would remain. The healing process starts with our experiences as individual physical beings because that is what we believe we are, otherwise we would not be having those experiences. \"The Holy Spirit takes you gently by the hand, and retraces with you your mad journey outside yourself, leading you gently back to the truth and safety within\" (T-18.I.8:3)."

    "text_input": "Q #376: My question involves the \"Rules for Decision.\" Because I do want to have the dream of judgment undone I want to understand these rules but I'm not sure I do. I would be truly helped by an example applied using the rules or something to make the concept clear.",
    "output": "First of all, you want to understand that how we experience everything in our daily lives represents a choice or decision. Then, you want to be clear that there are only two alternatives we are ever deciding between, no matter how many choices our lives and the world seem to present to us--the ego and the Holy Spirit. Each one represents a thought system and a way of looking at the world that is diametrically opposed to the other, leading to effects that are mutually exclusive. Now, so long as we are not aware that we have a choice that determines how we experience our lives, we will continue to make an unconscious and unrecognized decision for the ego, with all the consequences that follow from that choice, including guilt, fear, anger, pain, anxiety, depression, distress and conflict. It is the Course's purpose to help us recognize that not being aware of the choice is really a choice in itself, so that we can decide otherwise--for the Holy Spirit rather than the ego. Once you understand that it is only this level of choice that the rules for decision refer to, the rules should become clearer. The day we really want, despite what our ego may tell us, is not one in which we get our own way and all the things we think we want, but rather one in which we do not identify with the guilt in our own mind and therefore have no need to project that guilt outside ourselves onto others and the world around us. And so the rules then describe ways in which we can learn to decide that we do not want to be the judge of what our day should look like, for that is a choice to follow the ego's rules, based on a belief in our own separate interests, rather than the shared interests the Holy Spirit leads us to recognize. Jesus knows us well and recognizes that, despite our apparent best intentions to accept him as our teacher, we will become afraid many times during our day and once again will identify with the ego and its guilt and believe we know better than Jesus what we need. We will then need another rule to help us out of the ego fix we have chosen for ourselves. And so as we progress through the section, Jesus offers us ways to undo our unhappy choices and return our mind to his gentle guidance, which will allow us to use everything that seems to happen to us during our day as an opportunity to practice forgiveness. But if we have become entrenched in our ego choice and our own need to be right, then we may need further gentle persuasion that leads us to acknowledge that our own self-centered choice does not make us happy, opening the door to asking for help again. And so, for a specific example: I may begin my day by expressing a willingness to recognize my judgments as soon as they arise in my mind so that I may ask for help in releasing them and returning to an experience of genuine peace. And I may be moving through my day, periodically getting caught in thinking, for example, that finding a parking place near where I want to shop will make me happy or completing a project without any interruptions will allow me to be at peace. And then I find my irritation level rising as my goals are frustrated. At this point, I want to be able to recognize that I have accepted the ego as my teacher again and have defined my happiness and peace in terms of mastering external situations, thereby setting myself up as their potential \"victim.\" If that recognition comes quickly, I can also then just as quickly abandon the ego and return to Jesus' gentle guidance. But perhaps I have a run-in with someone I especially don't like and we end up butting heads. And there is no way I'm going to back down on this one, because I know I'm right. At some point, I may at least be willing to hear Jesus gently asking me if I like what I'm feeling now. And if I can have enough honesty and humility, I may be able to admit that I don't. And once again, that opens the door for another way of looking at the situation, one that doesn't place my own self-interest ahead of everyone else's and that allows me to see my own call for love being mirrored in the reactions of my \"antagonist.\" And so, as I practice these rules for choosing the Holy Spirit to guide my perceptions of my experience rather than the ego, increasingly I will find that I can have the kind of day I really want--one filled with a sense of peace and ease and joy-- no matter what seems to be happening on the \"outside.\" You may find the audio set, Rules for Decision by Kenneth Wapnick, which addresses this section in depth, helpful. Portions of this audio set are also included in our Excerpt Series on our Web site."

How do I \"enter with Him into a holy instant\"--and then \"let Him release me\"? \"He needs only your willingness ... \" (next sentence). I sincerely want to be released from this relationship because I find it ridiculous anyway--but to date I have been failing miserably and do not know how to get out of it.",
    "output": "You have found the key to answer your question in the next sentence: \"He needs only your willingness ... \" However, the willingness required here is not the same as wanting to get out of a relationship because it is ridiculous or in some other way undesirable. It is the willingness to recognize and take responsibility for the ego's use of the relationship, which is always to make the separation real and hold on to guilt. Any relationship that attracts you, whether you characterize it as special love or special hate, holds a multitude of thoughts, beliefs, and judgments about yourself and the other person, all based on the belief in separation, thus giving rise to guilt. You enter the holy instant with the Holy Spirit through the process of forgiveness. The first step in this process is to be willing to recognize all the beliefs and judgments you bring to the relationship, and then to question them in the light of the teachings of A Course in Miracles to whatever extent you understand them. This changes the purpose of the relationship from the ego's goal to the Holy Spirit's. If you are willing to have these beliefs and judgments transformed by the Holy Spirit, you will be released of them, and His perception will replace yours; thus you enter the Holy Instant. \"Never approach the holy instant after you have tried to remove all fear and hatred from your mind. That is its function. Never attempt to overlook your guilt before you ask the Holy Spirit's help. That is His function. Your part is only to offer Him a little willingness to let Him remove all fear and hatred, and to be forgiven\" (T-18.V.2:1-5). Your release is the release of guilt. The relationship will fall away when you no longer have any attraction to the beliefs, judgments and their ensuing guilt in the specific form that this relationship represents."

    "text_input": "Q #378: I have a question for you about \"looking.\" I am stuck on what I perceive as contradictory statements in A Course in Miracles and with what Ken says. The Course encourages us to look within and we will see the unreality of sin, guilt, and fear. Ken instructs us to get in touch with how much we don't want to look within and how much we don't want forgiveness and to ask the Holy Spirit for help in undoing this. I have done this but am struggling to find peace as a result. I am stuck on how long to look. How clearly do I look, how directly do I look, etc.? Early in the text we are encouraged to deny the denial of truth, by first accepting responsibility, then quickly asking the Holy Spirit for help. Further on in the text we are asked to look clearly at the ego, and our hatred \"even if it frightens you.\" Then in T-9.IV.4, I understand this passage to mean that the ego's plan would have us go through a similar process by looking clearly at the error.",
    "output": "A point of clarification to begin with: \"the ego's plan\" that you mention from Chapter 9 is not referring to looking at error within ourselves. The ego's plan is to have us see error very clearly in someone else, who is therefore deserving of our judgment and condemnation, and then attempt to forgive that--what The Song of Prayer refers to as \"forgiveness-to-destroy\" (S-2.II). In fact, this is the ego's major defense, one intended to keep us from looking within by focusing on the guilt in everyone else. We see the sin and guilt outside ourselves in our brothers, never recognizing that it is nothing more than a projection of our unconscious belief in our own sin and guilt. The ego would never encourage us to look truly within our mind at our sin, for if we truly look, as the Course says, we would recognize its unreality. But the kind of looking the Course is referring to is not the ego's guilty, fearful, furtive glances within, which assume the guilt is real and seek only to affirm its reality by not really looking. Rather it is a calm and gentle viewing of the contents of our mind with Jesus or the Holy Spirit as our Guide for seeing, for they know that what we see as heavy and repulsive is nothing more than shadows that vanish in the light of true forgiveness. However, this looking within is also not simply a reviewing of our past, inventorying all the self- accusations we harbor against ourselves as this self we believe we are, with its history of transgressions and omissions. For those \"sins\" and their accompanying guilt are as much covers over the guilt Jesus is inviting us to examine as are our projections of blame and attack against our brothers, for they also distract us from looking within our minds to the real source of guilt. But that does not mean that identifying and becoming aware of our judgments against both ourselves and others can't serve a different purpose from the ego's purpose of reinforcing rather than releasing guilt. We are fearful to look within because we have accepted without question the ego's assertion that we are \"the home of evil, darkness and sin\" (W-pI.93.1:1). But even that is a defense, for at a deeper level, our resistance to looking within is really our fear of losing our individual identity. Your struggle with looking within is really your ego's attempt at self-preservation. While you remain identified with the ego, you believe your own survival is at stake. Yet it is not the Course's purpose to take away our sense of self but only to help us undo the guilt that we have associated with it. At the very end of the process, we will see no value in saving the false individual self, and that will be a choice we will make most willingly, when we are ready. In the meantime, to help us release the guilt, the Holy Spirit very cleverly turns the tables on the ego, using what the ego has made as a defense against looking within as the means now for uncovering what is in our unconscious. In other words, the error or sin we see in our brother that so arouses our anger and judgment, or the failures we hold against ourselves for not living up to some ego ideal of how we should act and think, can be given another purpose when we begin to understand their origins. No other judgment is necessary or even possible without the initial self- judgment of the ego that we have sinned by seeking to separate ourselves from God and establish our own separate identity. The very self we believe we are is predicated on a crime so horrendous, we believe, that it can never be forgiven and always calls for God's vengeance. So anything we accuse ourselves or anyone else of is, in contrast, a pale shadow of that primal guilt. Yet each accusation is literally a shadow or projection of that initial accusation and, if we are willing, we can use every ego reaction to anything that seems to be outside our minds as a means of remembering the ontological guilt that is always necessarily underneath the reaction. If we are willing to withdraw our projections from all bodies--ours as well as our brothers--what we are left with is an experience of the guilt we have tried to keep hidden within our mind. And that is what we want to look at with Jesus or the Holy Spirit. Not that we will remember or need to remember our so-called original attack on God, but that guilt, stripped of any interpretation that attributes its origin to bodies, will be the naked guilt of the ego thought system. It will be a guilt that says: I matter to me more than anyone or anything else, and I hate everyone and everything that prevents me from having my way. There is nothing beyond that recognition to look at or examine. But if we are able to join Jesus in looking within at that guilt, we will simply not take it seriously. For we will have joined with the part of the split mind that knows that the split is not real and that love can not be attacked or destroyed. And in that recognition we will experience the peace that depends on nothing outside itself, for there is nothing outside it."

    "text_input": "Q #379: I experience myself as being told to review all I can of the \"authority problem.\" I have Ken Wapnick's set on the authority problem, but the world of the ego is preventing me from having the time to listen to it. I am wondering if you would have some other words of wisdom concerning this subject or any writings to which you could direct me.",
    "output": "We recommend that you set your ego straight! Work things out with your ego and listen to the audios. #304 summarized the key ideas involved in the authority problem, which Jesus tells us \"is the root of all evil\" (T-3.VI.7:3). It is understandable that there would be intense resistance to this topic, because it pervades all wrong-minded thinking, and to delve into it stirs up our ultimate fear that in some way or other, we are going to lose the battle of existence with God. Concealed in a dark corner of our minds is the \"truth\" that our existence as individuals is not authentic and can be extinguished the instant our defenses are exposed and demolished, which is inevitable. This ontological doubt about our very existence then seeps into all levels of our experience, so that we wind up challenging every single authority in our lives--either secretly or overtly. Or we go in the opposite direction and become completely submissive to authorities, secretly resentful, though, of their power over us. Either way works in the ego's service, because the separation is maintained. A Course in Miracles teaches us that the healing of this conflict begins when we ask for help to look at our wish to be autonomous individuals rather than part of the one Son of God, and we will be motivated to ask for help when we have recognized that wanting and defending a life of separate interests has not made us happy. The ego would have us believe that it is always one-or- the-other: either a tyrannical God is in charge or we are. Jesus corrects this erroneous thinking by assuring us that when we let go of our imagined need to be independent, we will feel as if we have just been released from imprisonment, and we will then experience the unending peace that is our inheritance as God's Son (T-3.VI.10-11)."

    "text_input": "Q #380: I thought I have been quite a consistent student recently. Thinking, reading, applying, uncovering all my negative thoughts. And (exactly with a scenario Ken described on one of the audios) finally I got so mad about my special relationship person. Just couldn't stop blaming him! When I felt that a storm is coming, my first reaction was to read something from the text of A Course in Miracles or from a workshop (usually it helps to calm down). This last time it didn't work for me, so I \"indulged\" myself with a fury! But strangely enough, I felt such a relief, no guilt at all! I know I did wrong, but there is no need to \"correct\" my mistake, to apologize, or something. I know this outrage can stop our relationship altogether, but there is another thought behind all of that--I had to do it to stop pretending I can \"stuff\" my feelings, get beyond mistakes I perceive in this person! I don't know where this will lead me to. Is there any hope that I wasn't with my ego one hundred percent?",
    "output": "First, what you want to look at is your concern that you were one hundred percent in your ego. A key part of the forgiveness process is learning not to fear the ego or to feel ashamed because you indulged yourself in a full-blown attack. We are trying to learn that the ego is really nothing but a \"tiny, mad idea\" we forgot to laugh at. So when we judge ourselves for indulging our egos, we are implicitly affirming that it is real, not just a \"tiny, mad idea.\" It would be more healing to just be honest about the attack, saying \"I attacked and it felt great!\" Period. It was \"wrong\" only in the sense that attack will never restore peace to your mind and will never lead you home to God. But that does not make it sinful. It just points out to you the cost of indulging your ego. When you no longer feel the cost is worth it, you would ask for help to go about things differently. The measure of progress with the Course is not whether you still have ego attacks, but rather, over a period of time, how quickly you remember not to justify them. Whenever we identify with the ego, we will be hateful, judgmental, fearful, etc., because the ego never changes. The amount of time we spend with it is what changes. Second, the process of the Course does not force you to choose between forgiveness and stuffing your feelings. Rather, it helps you learn why you attack--where your feelings are coming from. Thus, early in the workbook we are taught, \"I am never upset for the reason I think\" (W-pI.5). The practice of the lessons involves looking squarely at our negative thoughts and feelings, recognizing their source in our decision to reject love and then project responsibility for that, and, finally, asking for help to change that decision if we are so inclined. So stuffing our feelings and pretending that we are forgiving is not helpful. Our anger, hatred, jealousy, fear, anxiety, and whatever else we are feeling is our curriculum. These feelings are indicators of what teacher we have chosen and are usually our only means of surmising our mind's decision. Therefore, we need to be in touch with what we are experiencing. Otherwise, as our teacher, Jesus would have nothing to work with. He never judges us when we have ego outbursts. He just asks that we learn to recognize the ego dynamics behind them so that he can help us make the correction. When your ego is out of the way, you would relate to your special partner without defenses. You would experience both of you as sharing the same wrong mind, the same right mind, and the same ability to choose. Anger would be impossible in that state, because you would clearly see the origin of that person's pain and the healing of it as well, and you would know that it reflects yours. That is the state of mind Jesus is helping us to attain. It is not stuffing our feelings; it is attaining an ego-free state in which such negative feelings would never develop. We would share the perception of the Holy Spirit, Who sees either a call for love or an expression of love (T- 12.I). Finally, anger is not bad. Jesus never tells us not to get angry. He teaches us not to justify it--an important distinction."

    "text_input": "Q #381: In the answer to #58, it was stated that A Course in Miracles asks us to respond with love to someone having an outburst of any kind, and if our response is anything less than love, it is of the ego. What would be a response of love to a supervisor who is yelling at you in front of others while demeaning you and slamming papers on the desk? It was also stated in that same answer that we are to be vigilant for any underlying feeling or reaction. I feel I need specifics to do while this outburst is taking place. I am certain that I have the small willingness to help both him and myself, yet I am not sure of what to do to help us.  How responsible am I for having someone like him in my life? How responsible am I for having bad things happen to me?",
    "output": "One of the first things it may be helpful for you to do is to understand that the Course teaches us on different levels. Although Jesus is aware that we that we are dreaming of a multitude of experiences in form, he is speaking to the mind; specifically the power of the mind to choose. This is a Course is content (mind), not form (bodies). However, while we are still convinced that we are bodies in the world interacting with other bodies, it is never helpful to try to respond to a specific situation in our lives on the metaphysical level of the Course's teaching. The principles of the Course that you refer to from a previous question is the Course's explanation of what is occurring on the level of the mind. It is the real reason you feel all the things you feel when you are being yelled at, i.e., the effect of a choice in the mind to identify with the ego's thought system, rather than with the Love of the Holy Spirit. It is true that the ultimate goal of A Course in Miracles is to teach us to perceive only a call for love or an expression of love, but that is at the end of the process. Meanwhile, it is important to be honest about what you feel, without judgment, and without trying to come from a place in the mind with which you do not yet fully identify. The Course does not ask us to behave in any way that is not normal, on the level we believe ourselves to be. Your feelings during your supervisor's attack are certainly normal. As long as you have them, they should not be denied, ignored, or judged. That is not to say that you might still be willing to review them when you are studying the Course, to learn how its principles apply to this situation. It is very important, however, not to dismiss or diminish your feelings. They are indications that what the Course says is true--that we have a strong attachment to our identities as bodies. This is not a sin; it is a mistake in identity, and needs to be corrected by the Holy Spirit. Our function is to recognize that all the feelings we have when being attacked, as normal as they may be, do in fact come from this mistaken identity. During the actual attack it may be possible for you to ask for help. The help you may want is to feel better and not be attacked. The help you need is to learn to interpret the experience differently: \"You are not coerced, but merely hope to get a thing you want. And you can say in perfect honesty: I want another way to look at this\" (T- 30.I.11:2-4). As we are told in the very beginning of the workbook: \"I am never upset for the reason I think\" (W-pI.5). Even though you may not believe this during the attack, remembering to ask for help by recalling one or both of these thoughts when you are being attacked, gets you in touch with the part of your mind that does believe them. This is the beginning of the forgiveness process, and although it may not seem like much, it is a very important step. At first, you may remember these ideas only long after the actual attack takes place, and you have already been very upset. This does not matter, if you are willing, and try to be faithful to remembering, the time between the attack and your remembering will eventually shrink. It is not your function to try to think or feel differently, or to help your supervisor or yourself in any way; that comes from the Holy Spirit. With His help, your thinking will gradually shift, and you will no longer be upset in the same way by an attack. Until then, it is important not to judge yourself in any way for being upset, for forgetting to ask for help, or for any reaction you may have to the attacks. Only your honesty and willingness are required. It may be helpful for you to re-read the instructions in the Introduction to the workbook (W-in.8-9). In answer to the second part of your question, it is important to remember that since the world was made as an attack on God, it is filled with conflict, pain and \"bad\" things. A Course in Miracles is not a program for learning to control the form of our lives and our environment so as to avoid suffering. The goal of the Course is to train our minds \"in a systematic way to a different perception of everyone and everything in the world\" (W-in.4:1). We are learning to interpret ourselves, our experiences, and all our relationships differently. \"Bad\" things are bound to occur in this world, because it was made by the ego as \"a place where God could enter not\" (W-pII.2:4). As students of the Course, our goal is not to have a life free of difficulties, but that we learn they need not take our peace away. In the Holy Spirit's classroom, these difficulties are opportunities to recognize our mistaken perception about who we are, so we can ask for, and be willing to accept a new way of perceiving. This learning process is the way to remember that we are in fact home. Again, the Course is addressing the mind. When it tells us that the figures in the dream act out our projected guilt it is because everything in the dream reflects a choice made in the mind to identify with the ego or the Holy Spirit. The figures in the dream speak and act according to what we want to hear and see, just as the figures do in our night dreams. They reflect back to us our choice for shared or separate interests. You are not responsible for having a supervisor who attacks, you are responsible for the choice in the mind to identify with a body that seems vulnerable to attack. You are also responsible for all the steps you are taking in practicing the Course so as to learn gradually, gently, and patiently that you are not a body with separate interests."

    "text_input": "Q #382: I just started reading A Course in Miracles. For the last two years I've looked within and discovered some not so pleasant things about myself as well as some beautiful things about myself and others. My question is, are signs valid? I ask for signs on specific things and always  receive positive signs giving me hope, encouragement and reassurance, which all lead me to feel secure and peaceful. Being that there are no coincidences in life, wouldn't that mean that they are valid? Maybe the signs are supposed to happen to get us to believe in ourselves, which will make us more likely to believe in others. People are less judgmental when they are happiest as a person.",
    "output": "It really is difficult, if not impossible, to evaluate another person's experiences. We all have different ways of experiencing the Holy Spirit's guidance, as well as the ego's. If you are more peaceful and secure and are being kinder to yourself and others, what can be wrong with that? If there are any lessons that you have not learned, they will become apparent to you in your interactions with others at some point. The only caution to observe, perhaps, is with regard to any specialness you would be tempted to feel because you receive positive signs that other people might not receive. Also, depending on these signs or taking them as a measure of your spiritual progress would not be helpful on your spiritual journey. In The Song of Prayer, Jesus stresses early in his teaching that what we want to learn to want is the song itself: \"It is the song that is the gift. Along with it come the overtones, the harmonics, the echoes, but these are secondary\" (S-1.I.3:2-3). And in the text, he similarly points out the need to go beyond symbols to what they represent, if we are to advance spiritually (T-19.IV-C.11:2-4). If these signs are coming from the love that is in your right mind, then by identifying more and more with that source, your need for encouragement, reassurance, and security will diminish and eventually disappear. But this is a process that happens gradually. Having that as your goal, however, will help you recognize potential ego snares."

    "text_input": "Q #383: What does Ken mean when he says \"Say not no to the ego\" I believe this was said in an audio series.",
    "output": "We are not saying \"not no\" to the ego. If it was stated this way, it was misspoken. The ego can be understood as a \"no\" to God, and to the Identity that God has given us as His innocent Son. Saying \"not no\" is a way of saying that we deny the reality of the ego's thought system, and accept the truth of Who we are as God's Son. It means we do not say no. This is related to the idea that A Course in Miracles is a process of unlearning who we are not, so that who we are can return to our awareness. The truth does not require any affirmative response on our part to be what it is--it only requires that we say \"not no.\" The Course tells us that God established our identity as His innocent Son: \"I am your Father and you are My Son\" (W-pII.10.5:3). We have responded: \"No, I am not; I am who I say I am.\" And we have a long list of who we say we are. The process of forgiveness is teaching us to let go of all these concepts of the self, attributes of our made up identities, in this process we are saying \"not no.\" When we have said \"not\" to all of our no's, we will have cleared our minds of all the obstacles that blocked awareness of our true selves: \"When every concept has been raised to doubt and question, and been recognized as made on no assumptions that would stand the light, then is the truth left free to enter in its sanctuary, clean and free of guilt. There is no statement that the world is more afraid to hear than this: I do not know the thing I am, and therefore do not know what I am doing, where I am, or how to look upon the world or on myself. Yet in this learning is salvation born. And What you are will tell you of Itself\" (T-31.V.17:5-9)."

This awareness doesn't seem to have any content other than since I believe the truth of what I read, I should feel peaceful, not unsettled.

My life has been filled with beliefs that have filled my time with worldly concerns about who I am in relation to others and why I am afraid of money, etc. Since I started studying the Course again, I know my fears are not real and I don't experience fear very often. I've experienced some deep feelings of peace and clarity lately and I wish this would become more frequent. I think perhaps I'm trying too hard or that I'm too focused on ME as being solely responsible to learn and not asking the Holy Spirit to help me learn what I need to learn. I've felt alone all my life - believing in God but as somehow separate from me.",
    "output": "To your right mind, the Course's message is one that opens the door to peace. But to your ego, or wrong mind, the Course's message will at some level be experienced as a threat, for the purpose of the Course is to teach us how to undo the ego. So long as you remain identified with your ego in any way--as all of us here continue to do--it is not surprising that you may at times experience anxiety or other unsettled feelings as you read the Course. And you are certainly not alone in finding your memory failing you when you want to be able to apply the Course's principles, which you may have just been reading and studying five minutes earlier and now find you haven't a clue as to what you were looking at. Anyone who has attempted to do the workbook lessons and remember them at various intervals throughout the day has found these lapses all too familiar. But again, the \"forgetting\" is simply an ego defense to protect itself from being undone. The preoccupation with the things of the world--our personal and bodily needs and concerns--is yet another form of defense that keeps us rooted in our ego identity, oblivious to the actual choice such a perception of ourselves represents. We may know intellectually that our fears are not real and experience some peace as a result of this realization. But there are layers to our fear, so while we may move beyond fear of some of those old familiar monsters under the bed, we find there are others still lurking behind the shut doors of the closets of our minds, continuing to affect us until we are willing to open the doors and let the light shine on their nothingness. But there is no need to be concerned that they still linger for, again, that is to be expected until we get to the bottom of the layers of fear and release all the guilt that is concealed beneath them. And that is a process that for most of us will take time. So be patient with yourself and yes, please don't forget that you are not alone in this process, that in fact you cannot do it alone, and that Jesus and the Holy Spirit are ever present in your mind, available to help you remember the way back home, which is where we have been all along, simply with the covers pulled over ourselves so we can't see beyond the darkness we have hidden ourselves in (T-11.VIII.13-14; T-12.II.4-5)."

    "text_input": "Q #385: My partner was diagnosed with lung cancer in early March. Last Wednesday they surgically removed the tumor only to discover that not only was the tumor not in her lung but it was benign. Everyone is saying it was a miracle.\tprayer changed the tumor. As a student of A Course in Miracles, I'm ashamed to tell you that I think the doctors misdiagnosed the tumor in the first place. I think that doctors are always looking for cancer and so they find it everywhere. I feel guilty for my lack of faith. Do you have any words of comfort or wisdom for me?",
    "output": "There is an assumption implicit in your question that you may not be aware of. And that is that it is somehow more spiritual to believe that prayer changed the tumor than to believe that there was a mistake in the diagnosis from the beginning. From the Course's perspective, neither is true! Except for very rare exceptions in those who have healed their minds, symptoms of illness in the body are only ever shadows of guilt in our mind, projected onto the body. Illness always reflects a choice in the mind to see oneself as the victim of forces beyond one's control. And we all make the choice to be victimized repeatedly through our lives--illness being only one particular expression of that choice--and then forget we ever made the choice, as a defense against the truth of who we are as spirit (W-pI.136.2-4). Since each symptom represents a choice within our mind in each instant, we can make a different choice at each subsequent instant as well. The initial choice for illness is made with the ego. The choice for a different experience may be made with either the ego or the Holy Spirit, depending on our purpose. If we identify the guilt in our mind behind the symptom and bring that to the Holy Spirit for healing, then the symptom will diminish or vanish, for we will no longer feel a need to punish ourselves. It is possible for this shift to happen without our being fully aware of it, although the goal of the Course is to make our decision-making more conscious. The alternative is that we simply make a different ego choice, never really addressing the buried guilt, and so one symptom disappears, at some point to be replaced by another symptom, perhaps similar, but perhaps not. That is how we all experience our lives when we are identified with our egos, moving from one problem to another, seeming to lose our peace over each problem, feeling a sense of relief when it apparently is resolved, and then losing our peace apparently over the next problem, never in touch with the real cause of our loss of peace-- the ongoing decision to see ourselves as separate from love. What hopefully is apparent from this explanation is that God and faith have nothing to do with the healing of physical symptoms. The decision-making part of our mind that most of us are rarely in touch with is responsible for the appearance and disappearance of symptoms. In light of this then, it may also be apparent that whether the symptom at the level of form was cancer and then changed or was never really cancer at all is really beside the point. The only question we want to ask ourselves, as students of the Course, when we are aware of reacting to symptoms in either ourselves or others, is: \"With which teacher do I want to learn the lesson this symptom brings with it?\" If I choose the ego, my lesson will be that guilt and punishment are real. If I choose the Holy Spirit, my lesson will be that I now have the opportunity to make a different choice about the guilt that I believe is buried in my mind, releasing it to the healing light of forgiveness rather than continuing to hold on to it and projecting it in some disguised form."

    "text_input": "Q #386: Does physical healing require complete and final acceptance of the Atonement? If so, why do people who have never heard of A Course in Miracles and have never practiced forgiveness experience physical healing many times during their lives? I have a serious vein disease, which I've been trying to heal by following the Course. One time, for a very short while, I was able to see myself as not being my body. I experienced a wonderful feeling in my legs and for about 2 hours they seemed to be healed (at least they were pain free). Was this the kind of physical healing the Course talks about? Later the pain returned. Now, I cannot find my way back to that awareness of not being my body. But perhaps this is not necessary, because the Course says that the Holy Spirit will guide me if I only give my \"little willingness.\" I am not sure I understand the \"little willingness\" that I must give to the Holy Spirit. The Course says that if I give this \"little willingness,\" I will receive very specific instructions that will lead me out of my illusions and pain. The Course says that I should not try to free my mind from fear and pain because that is the Holy Spirit's role. I tell the Holy Spirit that I am willing to follow His way, but nothing seems to happen. Perhaps my understanding of the \"little willingness\" is not accurate. How can I give the Holy Spirit my \"little willingness\" in the right way?",
    "output": "First, final acceptance of the Atonement is not required for there to be a change in a physical condition. Our minds are extremely powerful, and they can both bring about physical symptoms and remove them, whether we have undone our belief in separation or not. A major teaching in the Course is that our bodies are not autonomous; they do only what our minds tell them to do. We cannot judge by observing physical states whether a person has identified with the wrong mind or the right mind. (See \"How Is Healing Accomplished? M-5.) Second, A Course in Miracles is not really about healing the body or any condition in the world, even though there is a great deal in the Course about healing. Healing in the Course is equated with forgiveness. One of the key guiding statements in this context is: \"Therefore, seek not to change the world, but choose rather to change your mind about the world\" (T-21.in.1:7). Jesus is teaching us how to shift our focus from conditions in the world and our bodies to the thoughts in our minds that lead us to believe that the world and our bodies are the cause of our problems and our unhappiness. It is natural to want painful physical symptoms to be removed, and we should use whatever remedy we can to alleviate the pain and correct the condition. But ridding the body of all symptoms is not the goal of our work with the Course. Achieving a state of inner peace regardless of external conditions is the goal. Ultimately, of course, we will awaken from the dream of separation, but the more accessible goal for us is to learn that our inner peace is not dependent on anything external. The peace of God is our true Identity, and so if we are not peaceful, then somehow we have dissociated ourselves from that Identity. Thus, the way to reverse the dissociation is to choose Jesus or the Holy Spirit as our Teacher--not in order to have the symptoms removed, but to help us change our perception and our purpose. Then, as we go along, we will be more and more content with inner peace, and as a result we will automatically begin to disidentify with our bodies; but it is usually very, very difficult to try to \"not be a body.\" We are very much attracted to being a pain-free, problem-free body, but not to be a body at all is a terribly frightening thought to most of us. That is why Jesus teaches us to concentrate first on the purpose for which we use our bodies, and why his help is directed at helping us break the connection between external conditions and our internal state of mind. We have used our bodies primarily as a way of proving that duality, not oneness is reality; so he helps us turn that around through our gradually and gently learning that nothing can truly disrupt the peace of God that is our natural state of being. So physical or psychological healing (removal of symptoms) is not the focus of the Course, although it never says it is wrong to treat the symptoms. In fact, denying our bodily experiences would hamper our progress spiritually (T-2.IV.3:8-11). We usually need to alleviate pain and discomfort so that we can feel more free to work on the inner process. The point, though, is that if the underlying conditions are not dealt with, then other symptoms will arise to take the place of those that are healed, which is the experience of almost everyone. \"Thus is the body healed by miracles because they show the mind made sickness, and employed the body to be victim, or effect, of what it made. Yet half the lesson will not teach the whole. The miracle is useless if you learn but that the body can be healed, for this is not the lesson it was sent to teach. The lesson is the mind was sick that thought the body could be sick; projecting out its guilt caused nothing, and had no effects\" (T-28.II.11:4-7). Finally, one essential aspect of willingness involves looking at our certainty that we know what our problems are and what their solution should be. The reason for our lack of peace often seems so obvious to us, and we feel so sure that we would be peaceful and happy again if only that condition or situation were removed or cured. Jesus is teaching us, however, to let go of that tendency to think that we know, because it is basically blocking access to our right minds where true healing is. And sometimes we could be setting ourselves up for failure if we concentrate exclusively on asking for help with a physical condition. It is not wrong to do so, as Jesus points out in The Song of Prayer where he speaks of a \"ladder of prayer\" (S-1.I-II), but the temptation would be to be disillusioned and then blame someone if there is no change, or to confine Jesus in our minds to the role of physical healer. The change that Jesus truly wants us to have as our goal is the experience of sharing his mind, which knows only of invulnerability, love, and peace.

    "text_input": "Q #387: I have begun reading A Course in Miracles and find that I'm very attracted to its teachings. I believe it has practical application to this world. My dilemma is that although I'm not new to spirituality and I believe in God--I have studied the Bhagavad Gita for many years and believe it was spoken by God (Krishna)--I have great difficulty in following the Holy Spirit's directions. My problem is that I work a mind-numbing job as a janitor, which I dislike most of the time. I feel stuck and grudgingly accept my lot in life. I work much on my own and that of course allows my \"little self\" to indulge in all sorts of judgments and criticisms, bitterness and anger at my position, etc. I also use tobacco to attempt to diminish my \"awful\" condition. I want to change. I know I'm doing wrong by my thoughts and the tobacco use but my \"little mind\" tells me that this is the only way I can get through another day of \"drudgery.\" Please give me some constructive advice.",
    "output": "Arjuna may have been on an external battlefield in the Gita as he turned to Krishna for guidance, but it sounds like you're beginning to recognize your battleground is in your own mind. Fortunately, that is where you'll also find the Holy Spirit's guidance. Now since the battleground is in your mind, that is where the Holy Spirit will help you to make changes, and not in the external world--the job, the tobacco, etc.,--which are only ever projections of the inner battle. This is not to say that changes won't happen on the \"outside\" as well, but that is never the Course's focus or goal. Those externals are only symbols or symptoms of internal conflict and guilt, and it is only within the mind that meaningful shifts can occur. The inner conflict is always the battle that your ego is waging against the quiet truth that the Holy Spirit represents. And when you are identified with your ego, you can expect to have difficulty even hearing the Holy Spirit's direction, let alone accepting it and following it. The challenge you feel in listening to the Holy Spirit may be two-fold--there is often difficulty in understanding just what He is asking of us, although it is very simple, and then, once we understand, being willing to follow-through on His counsel. You may believe that it is your lot in life, trapped in a dead-end job that you don't like, which is the reason you are so unhappy. But the Holy Spirit wants to help you see that the problem is that you are trapped in a dead-end thought system in your mind, and that is what He wants to help you free yourself from. And any addiction to nicotine is nothing compared to the addiction to guilt. All those thoughts of judgment and criticism and bitterness and anger merely keep you going around in your mind in the cycle of attack and guilt. But the Holy Spirit is not asking you to stop those thoughts. Rather He wants you simply to step back from them and look at them, being honest with yourself about the feelings that accompany them and the purpose that they serve. They keep you trapped in the belief that it is your external situation that dictates how you feel. This kind of thinking assures that you remain mindless and that the guilt in your mind--the real cause of your unhappiness--is never undone. You want to learn that the guilt in your mind is not real, but you'll never know that if you don't look at it, instead seeing the external situation as the cause of your misery and grief. So, once you understand the very simple request that the Holy Spirit is asking of you, all you need do is put it into practice. And that means nothing more, but also nothing less, than being willing to pull back your projections of blame on things outside yourself and accept complete responsibility for how you feel. And then ask for help that your perception of yourself as one who deserves to suffer be changed. This is the process, to be remembered and then put into practice as we are willing. And none of this means you should not look for or take a better job should you have the opportunity, or seek support that may help you give up smoking. But you want to remember that changes only at this level will not bring you the real happiness and peace you seek and deserve."

    "text_input": "Q #388: I have been thinking and meditating a lot on the concept of prayer. It seems to me that the only thing we can do in prayer is to give thanks. Because God does not and cannot enter the human form, we cannot ask for anything, but it seems that many people say that they prayed and God did this or that for them and thus their \"miracles.\" What happens here in these instances? Tell me more about prayer. I understand it seems silly to ask God to do what is already being done. What would Jesus say?",
    "output": "The Song of Prayer pamphlet may answer many of your questions regarding prayer. It describes different levels or steps, and uses the image of a ladder reaching up to God. The prayer you describe, whereby people ask for certain \"things\" (material, psychological, or emotional) for themselves or others, is at the bottom of the ladder. It is a form of magic, in that it seems that someone or something outside (in this case, God), granted a wish. What actually takes place is a process in the mind. A person wants something and uses the power of the mind to obtain it. But, because the person is unaware or afraid of the power of their mind, it appears that a petition is made and then granted by God, Jesus or the Holy Spirit. This is then called a \"miracle.\" As you may know, the miracle A Course in Miracles teaches (which is a change in perception), has nothing to do with anything external. Since the Course is teaching us that we do in fact have a mind and that it has the power to choose, it certainly would not want us to think that God grants prayers in the way described above. It tells us that true prayer is the prayer of the heart, and it is always answered because in the dream we have and experience anything we truly desire. A very important principle of the thought system of A Course in Miracles explains this: \"There is no world apart from what you wish, and herein lies your ultimate release. Change but your mind on what you want to see, and all the world must change accordingly. Ideas leave not their source\" (W-pI.132.5:1-3). The simple prayer of the Course then would be our willingness to change our minds. All of our efforts in practicing and applying the teachings of the Course--forgiveness, letting go of grievances, paying attention to our thoughts and beliefs, seeking the Holy Spirit's guidance to have them transformed, remembering our goal as often as we can --is the form our prayer takes. It is the expression of our willingness to accept the healing of our minds, the desire of our hearts, as we look honestly at all the forms our resistance and opposition take in our interactions and pursuits throughout the day. This prayer will eventually lead to the awareness of what we truly want, the top of the ladder of prayer when: \"You have understood that you forgive and pray but for yourself. And in this understanding you are healed. In prayer you have united with your Source, and understood that you have never left. This level cannot be attained until there is no hatred in your heart, and no desire to attack the Son of God\" (S-3.IV.4:3-5)."

    "text_input": "Q #390: I have been studying A Course in Miracles for a little over a year now. Your insights regarding the following would be greatly appreciated. I am undergoing a severe financial loss due to a disability that has left me unable to work. I am my only financial support. I feel that my willingness to atone is greatly present, and I feel that I am totally willing to accept responsibility for my experience. Clearly I need the Holy Spirit's help with the undoing of the extreme guilt and separation I obviously feel, but as much as I ask for help in this regard, I neither see nor experience any semblance of change in my experience. I don't feel any peace in my thoughts, only growing fear as my savings dwindle. I am facing eventual homelessness in my earthly existence. I don't know how to \"rise above\" this outcome. I don't know how to feel peace without an experience of help from the Holy Spirit. I understand that my ego is fighting my choice to follow the Holy Spirit, but at what point does the Holy Spirit take over and actually bring me the experience of peace. I thought that this was what Jesus is promising in the Course.",
    "output": "First, it is entirely in keeping with the teachings of the Course to do everything you possibly can to get financial assistance of some kind and to get help in finding a place to live if it becomes necessary for you to move. And it is also quite normal to feel fearful as you see your savings dwindle and face losing your home. This is a difficult lesson; but you are moving in the right direction in the process of restoring peace to your mind--the goal of the Course--by not blaming someone else for your circumstances, which is not easy to do. Hopefully, you are not blaming yourself, either. Our first inclination usually is to pin the blame for our conditions on other people, or on the \"system,\" or even on God. And if we don't do that, we usually blame ourselves, but, still, we are always tempted to hold someone else responsible, even for blaming ourselves. So to get beyond blaming is a major step. The next major step--not easy to do at all--is to let go of any investment in the outcome--that the only acceptable outcome is a means of income and not losing your home. Your pleading with the Holy Spirit seems to be pointed in that direction, and your peace seems to be conditional on that outcome, which is how most of us would react in these circumstances. But that assumes that that solution would be the best one for you. In the world's terms, yes, it would seem to be. Yet, there is no way of your knowing what your spiritual path is, and what would help you most on that level. Perhaps--but also perhaps not--these extreme circumstances are the means you (a decision-making mind outside time and space) have chosen to learn the lesson that nothing can truly take away the peace of God from you; nothing external to your mind has any power over you. In the words of Lesson 190: \"It is your thoughts alone that cause you pain. Nothing external to your mind can hurt or injure you in any way. There is no cause beyond yourself that can reach down and bring oppression. No one but yourself affects you. There is nothing in the world that has the power to make you ill or sad, or weak or frail\" (W-pI.190.5:1-5). Clearly the \"you\" Jesus is referring to is not the self we are aware of. But how freeing it would be to have this experience, and surely the whole Course is directed towards helping us attain this state. Thus it is not that we petition the Holy Spirit and then He decides when to give us the gift of peace; it is we who do the work of identifying and then dismantling the barriers to peace that we have erected in our minds. So the help Jesus offers is to be with you, as a loving brother who sees you as you truly are, as you work your way through these difficult circumstances, assured that his love for you and your love for him is all that matters. \"My trust in you is greater than yours in me at the moment, but it will not always be that way. Your mission is very simple. You are asked to live so as to demonstrate that you are not an ego ... \" (T-4.VI.6:1-3). That does not get bills paid, to be sure; but to know and experience that your real security and safety lie forever invulnerable beyond anything this world could provide would more than sustain you through this part of your journey. With fewer interferences, without guilt, anxiety, and conflict, it will easier for you to know what to do. \"Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all of the barriers within yourself that you have built against it\" (T-16.IV.6:1)"

    "text_input": "Q #391: I'm having difficulty understanding the difference between what you refer to as \"brain thoughts\" and \"thoughts in the mind.\" Even though I am still almost completely identified with my body, I cannot conceive of the brain thinking at all, but only the mind. And so to me, \"brain thoughts\" are simply the thoughts of the ego mind identified with the body, which is ascribing those thoughts to the \"thinking organ\" of the body--the brain. In the answer to #54, you say: \"Intelligence is a function of the brain, it is therefore part of the operational system of the body, not to be confused with the mind, which is not in the brain and does not require intelligence.\" Has the ego mind then \"made\" intelligence?",
    "output": "The ego doesn't have a mind, but rather, it is the belief (in the mind) that the separation is real. Yes, this belief made intelligence, since intelligence is of the brain, which is part of the body (the home of the ego). And yes, you are correct in your description of \"brain thoughts.\" The distinction between brain and mind is difficult, because we have such high regard for the brain, and because we do not know we have a mind. Although the ego made intelligence, the Holy Spirit can use it to serve His purpose rather than the ego's. A Course in Miracles itself is a good example of using words, ideas, and concepts, as seemingly understood by the brain, to reflect a choice that is made in the mind to \"unlearn\" our belief in the separation. The Course offers a very sobering description of the brain: \"You also believe the body's brain can think. If you but understood the nature of thought, you could but laugh at this insane idea. It is as if you thought you held the match that lights the sun and gives it all its warmth; or that you held the world within your hand, securely bound until you let it go. Yet this is no more foolish than to believe the body's eyes can see; the brain can think\" (W-pI.92.2). The mind doesn't actually think either. The Course uses the word thought, or thinking, in reference to the mind because this is a way for us to understand. We are cautioned, however, to remember that the form is limited: \"...words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality\" (M-21.1:9-10). The mind chooses between two beliefs, two \"thoughts\" (the separation is real or it is not), or two teachers (the ego or the Holy Spirit). You might also say the mind says either \"no\" or \"not no\" to the truth of the Identity given to us by God, which is His innocent Son. So it does not think--it chooses--that is all. When it chooses the ego, the illusion of thinking, judging, feeling, and acting in the dream goes into operation. When it chooses truth, it is still and rests in quiet certainty."

    "text_input": "Q #392: Reading the following passage in the text of A Course in Miracles brought up a question I've had for some time now: \"Fear not that you will be abruptly lifted up and hurled into reality. Time is kind, and if you use it on behalf of reality, it will keep gentle pace with you in your transition. The urgency is only in dislodging your mind from its fixed position here. This will not leave you homeless and without a frame of reference. The period of disorientation, which precedes the actual transition, is far shorter than the time it took to fix your mind so firmly on illusions\" (T-16.VI.8:1-5).  Some three years ago, I was doing selected workbook lessons and had reached a state of mind quite different from my \"normal\" functioning in the world. I was experiencing myself as at one with everyone and everything and aware that the mind is only one. This lasted for quite a while. But it was followed by a period of most intense and vicious ego attacks and I felt completely out of control--seemingly unable to prevent my ego from hurting me in all kinds of ways--sickness, finances, inner state of turmoil, attacking others, attraction to death, etc. I'm now doing the workbook again. How do I know whether I'm being gentle? And how do I sincerely attempt to do what Jesus asks in the workbook without holding back? My prior experience was that doing any one lesson could take me home if I did it wholeheartedly. How does one know that one's head is far enough above the water to withstand the inevitable return of fear as long as one's mind is split?",
    "output": "The \"retaliation of the ego\" is really the eruption of the part of your own mind that does not want to relinquish its independence, which would have happened had you continued to identify with oneness. If all at once in a flash you could accept oneness without reservation, chances are you would not be here in the world in the first place. So your response should be respect for the depth of your fear of oneness, but also gratitude for your willingness to return to the pure oneness of Love. Now it's a matter of patience with yourself and trusting in the process that has begun. It is a gradual process of growing into what seems to be a new identity, but is really just accepting back your natural state of being, which you swore you would never do (T-19.IV-D.6). The strength of our resistance and our fear usually takes us by surprise. One of the most commonly asked questions is how to tell if one's head is far enough above water to withstand the inevitable return of fear. There really is no way of knowing; but being too concerned about that can detract from our work of forgiving right now. There is a way of acknowledging and respecting your fear without giving it power over you or denying it either. As you go along, a sense of balance should develop between these two extremes. You never want to force yourself to work with the lessons or to study the text. Any need you might feel to do the lessons perfectly and as quickly as possible always comes from your ego, as time is nothing to Jesus. He's big on patience and gentleness, not perfection. Readiness does not mean mastery, he tells us (T-2.VII.7:8-9); and being too serious about the lessons just makes the error real. After all, we are undoing something that never happened, and \"the outcome is as certain as God\" (T-2.III.3:10). The practice of forgiveness itself will gradually reduce your fear and sense of disorientation. Specifically, the more you practice seeing your interests as not different from anyone else's-- and feeling comfortable with that perception--the more you are undoing the underlying belief in separation, which is the source of all fear. Jesus clearly knows what is involved in this process, and he instructs and reassures us many times, such as in the passage you quoted."

A Course in Miracles says my fear, guilt and attack are causing the problem. I need to heal my legs (mind) soon  because as they get worse, my fear is increasing, to intense levels that I have not experienced before in my life. As my fear increases, my legs get still worse. I need to break this vicious cycle soon or it is sure to end in death. If I die or go mad, how can I learn the Course, be healed and find peace?  T-26.VII.12:5-6: \"This world is an attempt to prove your innocence while cherishing attack. Its failure lies in that you still feel guilty, though without understanding why.\" I am not even aware of feeling guilty. Is it important for me to understand why I still feel guilty? If so, how can I find that understanding so that my mind and body will be healed? Or is all of this unnecessary? Can I just give it all to the Holy Spirit and allow Him to heal my mind and body? If so, how can I do this? I have tried many times to give Him the \"little willingness\" that he asks. My legs continue to get worse. One time, for a short while, I was able to see myself as not being a body. A wonderful feeling seemed to come over my legs. They seemed to be healed for about two hours (or at least pain free). Was this a holy instant? Or was this just an illusion of mine?  T-26.VII.14:1-3 \"The miracle is possible when cause and consequence are brought together, not kept separate. The healing of effect without the cause can merely shift effects to other forms. And this is not release.\" Does this mean I must be aware of the cause before I can bring it together with the consequence? I meditate deeply on this, but am unable to find the cause so that my mind and body will be healed. Or is this all the role of the Holy Spirit? If so, my efforts at giving Him the little willingness He asks for seem to have been unsuccessful. How do I proceed? Another thing that really concerns me is that I am unable to hide my fear from my wife. This is causing her to become afraid as well and she is starting to experience physical symptoms of her own. How can I stop this fear from spreading out like this in our \"world of illusions\"?",
    "output": "First of all, you may want to be sure that you are doing everything you possibly can medically for your condition. Are you satisfied with all the medical opinions you have received and are you convinced that there are no other medical interventions, traditional or alternative, that can help arrest or reverse the deterioration? There is nothing in the Course that would preclude seeking answers in the world, if that can help ease your fear (T-2.IV.4:5-7). In addition, you and your wife may wish to seek some counseling or therapy to help you both address your fears over your condition. The goal of the Course is not to help us change anything external in the world or in our bodies, although changes may occur as a result of practicing its principles. Would you be satisfied with an outcome in which you are at peace, regardless of what seems to be happening to your legs and your body? This is the invitation that Jesus is extending to all of us through his Course. It may not be what we think we want, for we are still focused on the world of form and believe that our peace depends on controlling conditions and situations that seem to be causing us pain and fear. Jesus views our circumstances differently, and joining with him in our minds will allow us eventually to see things the way he does. We all share the same underlying guilt that is the cause of all our symptoms and all our fears. It is not a specific guilt over a specific action or inaction in this lifetime, but rather a self- accusation that is at the core of our being--that we exist as separate individuals because we seized our life and independence from God, a vicious, deadly attack on Him. Very few are in touch with the guilt over this mad idea, which the Course assures is nothing more than an illusory self-deception to keep the separation real in our minds. Yet that is what we unconsciously believe and keep choosing to believe. We in fact made the world and our bodies with all their seeming problems to keep that guilt buried in our minds. So now it seems that things happen to us over which we have no control and we no longer see all of our pain as coming from a choice to see ourselves as separate from the Love that is our Source. Conditions in our bodies seem to be the cause of our pain and fear. Everything seems very serious to us because it is a symbol of what we unconsciously believe God is now going to do to us for our attack on Him--punish us by making us suffer before He finally seizes back the life we stole from Him, not leaving us a leg to stand on. The real cause--the guilt over separation--would remain forever buried in our minds if we didn't have the assistance of the Holy Spirit. Not that we simply give Him our pain and fear and He takes it away. For that would undermine the power of our mind--which has chosen the pain and guilt in the first place--to make a different choice, for peace, once we remember that the choice is ours (T-2.VII.1). The Holy Spirit turns the tables on the ego by teaching us how to use what we have made as a cover for our guilt--the physical symptoms--as a means to recognize the guilt, at least indirectly. With the help that Jesus or the Holy Spirit offer us, we can begin to question the truth of our underlying belief about ourselves that says we deserve to suffer for our sinfulness. As our relationship with Jesus or the Holy Spirit develops over time, as we practice turning to them for their interpretation of our situation once we recognize we have been listening to the ego's, we will find that we are allowing ourselves more of the time to experience the love that has always been there within us but that has been covered over by the guilt and the fear. Concern with the body will also begin to recede. Symptoms may or may not shift, but in those moments when we are joined with Jesus' love, the physical symptoms will not matter. It is certainly possible that, in your experience of no pain in your legs when you were open to the idea that you are not a body, you allowed yourself to join with Jesus' love and experience a holy instant. What is helpful about that experience is that it demonstrates that nothing needs to change but the beliefs in your mind. Pain returns when we become afraid of love, but as we learn that it is not a sin to be afraid of love, we will recognize that we do not need to punish ourselves for believing once again that we have separated from love. Now the temptation will be strong to use the status of the condition in your legs as a measure of your success or failure in applying the Course's principles of forgiveness and joining with Jesus, but this is simply an ego trap to bring your focus back to the world of form rather than the choice in your mind for peace. The experience of peace is the only criterion you want to employ (T- 14.XI). A few additional points of clarification: Rest assured that the death of the body has no effect on our learning the Course, but only seems to be a limiting factor while we still identify ourselves with the body. It is the mind that learns the lessons of the Holy Spirit and the mind does not depend on the body's existence to retain those lessons. In truth, the body is contained in the mind and not the other way around, as we have fooled ourselves into believing. This will become clearer over time as you practice forgiveness. The passage on the miracle that you ask about means that we want our focus to be on the cause (the guilt in the mind) rather than on the consequence (the symptom in the body). For if our goal is only the healing of the physical symptom rather than the real problem in the mind, even if we find a way to eliminate the physical symptom, it will simply be replaced by another symptom if we have done nothing about healing the guilt over the separation in the mind. And, as Jesus notes a little later in the text, \"The miracle is useless if you learn but that the body can be healed, for this is not the lesson it was sent to teach. The lesson is the mind was sick that thought the body could be sick; projecting out its guilt caused nothing, and had no effects\" (T-28.II.11:6-7). Now this is not intended to make us feel guilty if we still want the body to be healed--a natural desire while we remain so identified with it--but only to remind us that so much more is ours than what we are asking for (T-15.III.1-2)."

    "output": "Although mediation is not essential to the practice of the Course it does encourage us to have quiet time in which to reflect, practice specific exercises of the workbook, to become mindful, or remember the lesson of the day. Long periods of meditation are not needed: \"Nor ... [are] long periods of meditation aimed at detachment from the body necessary\" (T-18.VII.4:9). As long as meditation does not become an end in itself, or a substitute for applying the Course teachings to all relationships and situations in your life, it may be a helpful exercise for you. For clarity regarding what is required, it may be helpful to reread the instructions in the Introduction to the workbook. Basically, the only requirement is that we do what the lessons ask. The goal of the Course is the healing of our minds of the thought of separation. The process for achieving this is forgiving every thought and belief we hold that reinforces the thought of separation. They are forgiven by first becoming aware of them, and then being willing to give them to the Holy Spirit (the part of our minds that remembers God) so they can be transformed. Remember, the Course is about mind training: \"It is the purpose of this workbook to train your mind to think along the lines the text sets forth\" (W-in.1:4). We are being asked to become mindful of our thoughts, feelings, and beliefs throughout the day. It is through awareness, forgiveness, and transformation of these thoughts and beliefs that we will find ourselves. The Course curriculum is enough for us to find our true selves and to hear the Voice for God. It is that Voice we hear each time we are willing to question the ego's thought system with which we have identified, with willingness to let it go. We hear the Voice each time we practice a lesson, or apply a teaching, as best we can."

The reason I pose this question is that the concept of sharing seems to be inherently dualistic, while A Course in Miracles is based on non- dualistic metaphysics. What am I missing?",
    "output": "This passage came early in the dictation of the Course, and Jesus was using words that reflect the Oneness of Heaven but come in a form that Helen and Bill, as well as all of us, might more easily be able to understand and accept. It is a correction for the ego's foundational belief in separate interests. Any concept as we usually use it, including sharing, extending and creating, will necessarily have a dualistic meaning, made as it was by a dualistic mind. But Jesus uses these words and gives them a different meaning from the ego's, to help our limited minds begin to grasp what cannot truly be grasped and to begin to undo our faulty beliefs about where joy and happiness lie. So, despite the use of words that suggest multiple entities and individuality, we need to recognize Jesus' intent here, and consider these words in the context of passages that come later in the Course that make it clear that the nature of God and Heaven is only perfect Oneness (e.g., T-25.I.5; W-pI.132.12:3-4; W-pI.169.5-6). See also Questions #72 and #85 for further discussion of the Course's use of dualistic language."

    "text_input": "Q #396: I understand that attacking others is a projection of the guilt in myself, but what is the underlying reason for my obsessively wanting to help others in the sense of telling them about the thought system of A Course in Miracles? I know it could change their whole life, like it did mine.",
    "output": "This tendency is all too common, but understandable, given the fact that so many of us feel that the Course \"rescued\" us in some way or other. But a red flag should go up every time we feel an obsessive need to introduce the Course into someone else's life, or to spread it around our floundering, failing world. There are several points to consider when such a need develops. Whenever we feel a need to help others, we have always identified with the ego. The Holy Spirit can certainly help others through you, but in that case, you would not experience yourself as the one who is helping, and you would have absolutely no investment in the outcome. This is what Jesus means in saying that the extension of holiness and the miracle is not up to us (T- 16.II.1; T-27.V.1). Deeply embedded in our unhealed minds is the belief that we are in competition with God, and therefore there would always be a need to prove that we can do at least as well as He, if not better. Consequently we would tend to think that we know what is best for ourselves and others, and so we thrust ourselves, armed with A Course in Miracles, into other peoples' lives, convinced that we know what would help them, and equally convinced that our motives are pure and holy. We somehow have lost sight of the first 25 lessons in the workbook, which help us undo such faulty and burdensome perceptions. Our inability to know what is best is further elaborated on in the manual in the section \"How Is Judgment Relinquished?\" (M-10). Also deeply embedded in our minds is the desperate need to validate our belief that separation and duality are real--that there is indeed a world in need of saving. A very effective way of reinforcing the belief in separation is to see people as fragile, deprived, vulnerable, helpless, victimized, and dependent on some outside source to help them. If you perceive that you have just the thing they need, then you have seen yourself as separate--you have something they do not have. And not far behind that is the thought that someone or something is responsible for the plight of these poor innocent people: blame, the ego's favorite means of maintaining conflict and banishing peace. If you perceive yourself and others who seem to be struggling as sharing the same ego beliefs as well as the same right-minded beliefs, you would not charge in to fix them, because as a good Course in Miracles student you would know that accepting the Atonement for yourself is your only responsibility (T-2.V.5:1), which you would be practicing by not seeing your interests as separate from theirs. If you charge in anyway, then you have become frightened of the implications of undoing the separation and have switched to your wrong mind, which automatically sees separate interests. When you are in your right mind, you would empathize with the strength of Christ in them, and you would respect the power of their minds to decide whether to listen to the ego or the Holy Spirit, and in so doing you would be reinforcing in yourself, the power of your own mind. In that holy instant, you would be guided to do something, or to do nothing; but it would not be coming from you as an individual self perceiving other individual selves."

    "text_input": "Q #397: My question relates to a sense I have that we have reached a critical mass and are on the rush side of salvation. Though we may have had millions of years to go, from the contribution of A Course in Miracles alone, I think of all the people, since the book was published, who have done the lessons, which, if I remember correctly, can save a thousand years.  I think maybe we are much further than we might think because of this theory: For a single act of malice (which we can assume was initiated by a thought of separation) there are hundreds of simple acts (and thoughts) of kindness, such as smiles and opening of doors and so forth. In order to keep the illusory world alive, our egos feed on stories, whether they are reported in the press or shared at home or in the workplace as gossip, which amplify the one act of malice. Almost everyone who hears of the negative story responds with a separating thought, thus amplifying the negativity. If we have, in fact, awakened appreciably, might this explain why the press has grown in its coverage and lunacy? How simple salvation might be now. How helpful to simply abstain from gossip, personal and press. What do you think?",
    "output": "An interesting idea, but there are some assumptions you are making, which you may wish to consider. For one, you may be overestimating the ratio of acts and thoughts of kindness to malicious acts. Every thought of irritation, frustration, annoyance, exasperation, etc., no matter how trivial and seemingly neutralized by covering it over with a smile and a nice word or two, shares the same content as the act of malice you mention that gets all the air time. And how many of those \"minor\" ego attacks do we each experience in a day, if we are honest with ourselves? Remember, there is no hierarchy of illusions--all are equal in their power to deprive us of our peace. In addition, it is a common belief--but not the Course's position--that a major obstacle to the experience of peace is any expression of negativity or attack thoughts, by oneself or by anyone else. And therefore anything that perpetuates the awareness of the negativity, such as the media or personal gossip, is contributing to and magnifying the problem. But the negativity is not simply generated by hearing or repeating gossip or reacting to reported acts of violence in the news. These are only outpicturings of the negativity buried in the mind that has been there all along and remains there until a deliberate choice is made against the ego thought system and for the Holy Spirit. That is the real problem. As such, if looked at with the Holy Spirit, these expressions of negativity and our reactions to them can actually serve a helpful purpose in healing the mind. The problem is never the specific expression but its purpose. And expressions of negativity reflect the desire to project the guilt within our minds onto someone else. What needs to be changed are not the external expressions of negativity but the inner decision to keep one's own guilt real but hidden by projecting it on to others. Stopping the external expression of attack, or avoiding exposing oneself to others' expressions of negativity, will accomplish nothing if the inner guilt that motivates the projection is not acknowledged and released to the Holy Spirit. Changing the external form without recognizing what is behind it only pushes the guilt deeper into the unconscious, where it continues to have unconscious effects, perhaps in the form then of illness or extreme rage when it is finally projected, as it must be so long as it is denied. The negativity exists in the mind and the external event merely elicits it out from under the veils of denial. It may be helpful to remember that a healed mind has no reaction to the so-called negativity of the world, whatever form it may take, because it has no guilt within that it needs to project. Now there is certainly nothing wrong with abstaining from gossip, especially once we understand the hateful purpose it serves. For gossip reinforces the ego's hidden reservoir of guilt. But again, merely curbing the activity without a corresponding inner shift that chooses against the ego, which always looks to see the guilt outside the mind in others, does not undo the guilt that lies buried there. If I find myself in judgment of the media or the gossiper, I have accepted the same ego purpose. And finally, your opening comments suggest there is a kind of momentum that builds as more and more people embrace the Course and practice forgiveness. There can be a kind of wishful thinking behind this idea, almost as if I will not have to make the choice, moment by moment, against my ego and for the Holy Spirit, because the collective mind is going to bring me and everyone else along in the inevitable flood of forgiveness. And the special danger here is that we will underestimate the wiliness and the tenacity of the ego and overlook the subtle ways in which it continues to keep itself alive through reinforcing specialness and separation, albeit in seemingly more acceptable \"spiritual\" forms. My only responsibility, as the Course reminds us repeatedly, is to accept the Atonement for myself. So long as the guilt over separation remains real in my own mind, that is the only thing I need be concerned about. For, as Jesus reminds us, only one teacher of God--myself--is needed to save the world (M-12)."

    "text_input": "Q #398: Would you please address the difference between the idea of return, as discussed in \"The Temple of the Holy Spirit\" section of A Course in Miracles, and reciprocity in the sense discussed in the paragraph below? What is a right-minded view of reciprocity in our relationships in the world?",
    "output": "The two ideas actually are not related. Their meanings differ, as the following answers explain. \"We will begin the longer practice periods today with a short review of the different kinds of 'laws' we have believed we must obey. These would include, for example, the 'laws' of nutrition, of immunization, of medication, and of the body's protection in innumerable ways. Think further; you believe in the 'laws' of friendship, of 'good' relationships and reciprocity\" (W-pI.76.8:1-3). The term reciprocity in this context refers to special relationship bargains. The premise of this type of relationship is that we must give in order to get, even though we would much rather--if we were truly honest with ourselves--just take what we wanted without having to give something in return. But in the world of special relationships, bargaining is the name of the game and it is always reciprocal. That is, A does it with B, and B in turn does it with A. Our buried guilt and self-hatred lead us to believe that no one would just give us what we want--we don't deserve it--so we must always engage in sacrifice and make compromises in our relationships. I will sacrifice for you, and then you will sacrifice for me. This dynamic pervades all special love relationships, and is thought of as the nature of loving relationships in the world. Right-minded reciprocity is grounded in our understanding that God's Son is one, which is reflected in our experience here of seeing everyone as sharing the same interests. We all share the same wrong mind and the same right mind. We all are part of the one Son who believes he attacked Love and rejected his true Identity by choosing individualized existence apart from the perfect Oneness of God, and who can undo that choice by accepting the Atonement right here and now. This oneness is the basis of the Course principle that giving and receiving are the same, which negates the need for bargaining of any kind (we are speaking on the level of content only). The reciprocity in a holy relationship, thus, is just love extending to itself. \"For if love is sharing, how can you find it except through itself? Offer it and it will come to you, because it is drawn to itself\" (T-12.VIII.1:5-6). This, of course, pertains only to what is going on in our minds, and it can be our perception whether we are talking to an inmate on death row, a beloved friend, or are simply thinking about someone who died twenty years ago. \"You cannot make the body the Holy Spirit's temple, and it will never be the seat of love. It is the home of the idolater, and of love's condemnation. For here is love made fearful and hope abandoned. Even the idols that are worshipped here are shrouded in mystery, and kept apart from those who worship them. This is the temple dedicated to no relationships and no return\" (T- 20.VI.6:1-5). If we maintain our identification with the body, believing it is reality--and a sacred reality at that--we will never return home, because we will never return to our minds where we would become aware of, and then be able to reverse, our choice to replace our true home in God with a self-made home in the body. We must at least be willing to question the reality of the body (T- 24.in.2:1); we do not have to give it up. Once we allow ourselves to take that first step, we begin the process of shifting the purpose of bodily existence, and we are on the path back to our true home, comforted and helped by Jesus each step of the way."

As I have been going along in my forgiveness path, I am learning to let the Holy Spirit speak through me to others. My answer to my brother is often something that I realized I needed to hear as well, or something that I needed to have reinforced that I already learned. Sometimes I feel guided to say something that truly has nothing to do with the situation at hand. Why would Jesus want me to say it? Sometimes I say something and I feel like everyone looks at me like I am crazy! Please, advice would be so greatly appreciated!",
    "output": "There really is no way of knowing why you are prompted to say certain things. In our present state we cannot see into our minds where all the choices and dynamics take place. It might help you, though, to shift your attention away from what the voice says, to doing what it tells you to do so that you can hear it better. As we have come to realize, the emphasis in A Course in Miracles is always on undoing the interferences to our hearing the Voice of the Holy Spirit. This is something that Jesus stressed with Helen, the scribe of the Course: \"Remember you need nothing, but you have an endless store of loving gifts to give. But teach this lesson only to yourself. Your brother will not learn it from your words or from the judgments you have laid on him. You need not even speak a word to him. You cannot ask, 'What shall I say to him?' and hear God's answer. Rather ask instead, 'Help me to see this brother through the eyes of truth and not of judgment,' and the help of God and all His angels will respond\" (Absence from Felicity, p. 381). So as Jesus helped Helen to learn, our goal ought always to be to perceive ourselves and others through the non-judgmental eyes of forgiveness, which we approach by first looking at our readiness to judge and find fault. We all are eager to have our egos out of the way so that the love of Jesus or the Holy Spirit would speak through us to others, and then we would be truly helpful. But that is usually a long, long process because we have so many defenses in place and we are not aware of our tenacious need to maintain these defenses (the many forms of judgment, specialness, and bodily concerns). When the ego is gone, there is only one Voice, and there is no other self to wonder about its meaning. But that is the end of the process. Jesus just asks that we take the little steps right now that lead in that direction (W-pI.193.13:7), not so that we will always say the right things to others, but so that we would no longer want to be other than as God created us. An article called \"Learning to Listen\" appeared in the September 2003 edition of The Lighthouse; we have also published an audio album called \"Healing: Hearing the Melody.\" Both are helpful sources in working with this important topic of listening."

Could you please elaborate on this \"without categorizing of desirable and undesirable?\" Thank you!",
    "output": "The problem with all of our judgments is not that they are bad in themselves, but that our belief in them makes the error of separation real all over again in our minds. When we identify some experiences as good or desirable and others as bad or undesirable, we have fallen into the ego's trap of opposites, or opposition, which necessarily is an invitation to conflict. While we have a split mind, we are almost certainly going to vacillate between right-minded thinking/experiences and wrong-minded thinking/experiences. In reality--that is, the oneness of Heaven--neither is real or true. In the context of the earlier question you refer to, to impose categories of desirable and undesirable on them is to give them a reality they do not have. The Holy Spirit's only judgment is that wrong-mindedness is false and right-mindedness, although still an illusion, is a reflection of what is true. Now it is true, from our perspective within the split mind, that the Holy Spirit is attempting to lead us toward a recognition that wrong-minded thinking brings us pain and right-minded thinking brings us joy, for in our confused state of mind we believe just the opposite (T-7.X). And only a fool, once we understand our confusion, would deny that one of these states is preferable to or more desirable than the other. But if we begin to judge the ego state as undesirable in the sense that we want to resist it, and condemn ourselves for experiencing it, then we have played right into the ego's hands, for now there is something real that we need to direct our efforts against. That is why Jesus emphasizes over and over again in A Course in Miracles, that all we need to do is look with him at what our egos have made without trying to change it (e.g., T-4.III.7-8; T- 11.V.1-2), while recognizing its cost. If we try to change it, then we say the ego itself is the problem, when the only problem is our belief in it. And we can't undo that belief on our own, for that is the belief--that we are on our own. And so we want to look at our ego with Jesus or the Holy Spirit beside us, and share their vision of the unreality of the ego, not judge it as undesirable and attempt to change it or fix it in some way that will make it more acceptable to us--and our ego! So the goal is not to be judgment-free, for that comes only at the very end of the forgiveness process, but rather to learn more and more not to judge ourselves for having our ego judgments. A helpful audio program that elaborates on this learning process is The Meaning of Judgment by Kenneth Wapnick."

    "text_input": "Q #402: My question concerns some past and present events in my life as well as questions on some of the other questions presented here. First, my question relates to Questions #3, #215, and #195. All of which say that it is important to \"do your best.\" When I look back on specific past events there is a voice that judges them and says I didn't do my best and therefore don't deserve the prosperity I have now. I succeed in seeing past these judgments as cries for love, yet something just never lets me free of the intense guilt they produce. When I see \"do your best\" written here at the place I seek refuge, it makes me wonder if that statement \"do your best\" is a law reflected in my mind that accuses me of not doing my best. Is it part of forgiveness that I re- enact these past events and live them according to what I bitterly think of as \"the best I can do?\" What if I want to do the worst I can do? Does this exclude me from the prosperity I seek in my life?",
    "output": "Guilt over prosperity, or anything symbolizing success in the world, most often stems from the belief buried in our minds that we stole what we have attained and therefore it is not legitimate. Our very existence as individuals in the world, we believe, is not legitimate because it came by means of stealing God's power, making it our own, and in the process killing Him off. Therefore success and prosperity in the world would be associated with that \"crime\" (illusory of course) of which we accuse ourselves. A terrible sense of guilt and unworthiness would automatically follow, which is why we are taught in many different ways in A Course in Miracles that our only responsibility is to accept the Atonement--the principle that the separation from God never happened. When these self-accusations are seen as unjustified, then all guilt would simply disappear; and if there is no longer any guilt in our minds, then we would be instruments for the extension of love, which would occur regardless of our financial status. So the voice that continually reminds you of your unworthiness is the voice of the ego, for guilt is its life blood: no guilt, no ego. Thus the first obstacle to peace is the attraction of guilt (T- 19.IV-A.i). And since another name for guilt is self-hatred, the shrieks accusing you of not doing your best might well be self-judgments haunting you over your (all of our) stupidity and viciousness in thinking you could get away with killing God and granting to yourself what He would not grant you. That is always the bottom line of our guilt. Being critical of our less-than- commendable efforts in the world is a smokescreen intended to keep our attention away from the real cause of our agony, which is our ongoing decision to prefer a special separate existence apart from God and the unity of the Sonship. The correction of this madness begins by regarding everything in the world--including everything about bodily existence--as neutral, and then focusing only on the purpose for which we would use everything: to reinforce the separation (following the ego's guidance) or to undo the separation (following Jesus' or the Holy Spirit's guidance). In this sense, then, wealth is neither holy nor unholy. The purpose for which we would use it gives it its meaning. Making this kind of a shift in our minds is usually a long and gradual process because of our defenses and our resistance, both of which are hidden from plain sight in our terrified minds. In that sense we just do the best we can. Our denial is so massive and the fear behind the denial is so intense that it is a wonder that we make any progress at all in extricating ourselves from the ego's pernicious web. To use an experience common to all of us: If you wake up in the morning a little groggy, you may be unsteady on your feet, and your vision may be blurry. You do the best you can until you are fully awake and feeling normal again. You can't do more than that, and no one who is kind and gentle would expect you to do more than that. Given our groggy, fearful state of mind and blurred vision, Jesus as our kind and gentle teacher knows that we are doing only what we are capable of doing and he would never reprimand us for not doing our best, for that would serve only to make the error real, and above all he is helping us to remember that we, with him, are the eternally sinless Son of God."

And, if so, does that mean he's more spiritually advanced than I am?",
    "output": "Anyone who even asks a question is behind the spiritual eight-ball, Jesus doesn't hesitate to point out to us (T-27.IV), so to ask which version of forgiveness is more spiritually advanced probably would not attract very much celestial attention. Nevertheless, if the content is that God loves us without reservation, then the way that gets expressed in form is irrelevant. As Jesus states: \"A universal theology is impossible, but a universal experience is not only possible but necessary. It is this experience toward which the course is directed\" (C-in.2:5-6). Jesus would always direct our attention to our need to see differences that keep us separate from each other in our perception. That he would want to help us correct, for it is far more important to him that we work with him in removing the barriers to seeing our oneness with each other, than having us get his terminology straight. Strictly speaking, though, the view of forgiveness in A Course in Miracles is that there is nothing to forgive because nothing ever happened that is in need of forgiveness."

I have known all my life since I was very little that I actually chose to come here, and further, that I chose to come to my mother. Now that I am reading A Course in Miracles, I wonder about it. It has always felt as though I left \"Heaven\" consciously to come here and that everyone does. I never saw it as a choice against God. I have always felt very connected to God. I am struggling with this. I understand from the Course that I do not need to understand things, just be willing to follow the path the Holy Spirit shows me. That seems very right. But I keep coming back to my question of how I could choose to separate from God. Was I supposed to? Is that part of salvation? I am learning that my mission here now is forgiveness--that seems right. But why did I come here in the first place? Is there temptation even in Heaven? I know I was in Heaven before I came. I know I will be there again after this life--why did I leave there in the first place? Jesus chose to come, but he did not choose against God, did he?",
    "output": "Your confusion is understandable. It arises at least in part from superimposing the world's conception of Heaven and earth on the Course's language. For the memory of the choice that you recall making to \"come here\" into this lifetime is a memory, from the Course's perspective, that would still be from within the ego thought system of separation and duality. In other words, the Heaven you think you remember leaving to have the experience of this lifetime is not what the Course means by Heaven. It is the mind, not the body, that seems to exist outside Heaven in its choice for separation, and our bodily existence is simply a symbolic representation of that choice for separation, and not the choice itself. There is a conscious, seemingly separate or split mind that makes choices about bodily experiences and lifetimes. It is to the ego's advantage to convince us that the contrast between these two seemingly different levels of existence--separate mind outside of time and space, and body in time and space--is real. And to persuade us that once this life in this body is over--as if life in this body is the separation and the problem--that we will be back in Heaven. But until we make the decision to release all judgments based on the belief in individuality and specialness, which are thoughts in the mind independent of bodies, we as split mind will continue to choose experiences that seem to provide us evidence that the separation is in fact real. And we will continue to find ourselves believing we are outside of Heaven. With respect to Jesus, you are falling into a similar kind of confusion, based on the world's commonly held beliefs about the nature of Jesus. There is no Jesus in Heaven, for he is simply a symbol in our split mind that we have given form, who represents the true memory of our home in Heaven, where all is one and individuality has no meaning. Now, while we still believe we are separate from the oneness of Heaven, there is nothing wrong in using these symbols, such as Jesus, to help us learn our lessons of forgiveness. In fact, we need to if we are going to benefit from the Course as our spiritual path back home (T-27.III.5). But it would be a mistake to take the symbols for reality, for the reality of Heaven is beyond anything we can comprehend with our split minds."

This point may not be so much wrong as something I can't judge. Even so I am concerned I've misled people. I feel responsible for this. I was practicing A Course in Miracles but people I dealt with didn't understand that even when I told them. Is there a reason, perhaps, to declare that I may not have been practicing the Course, if I am wrong? It seems related to ask what happens with the concept that I need what  others need, or that I should do what anyone else would do, if what in fact occurs is that what I end up doing is quite unusual? I acted based on what I thought I needed. Now I see how very important it is to the Course to comprehend what it is to need nothing, even if I still have a long way to go. I find it very, very difficult to do everything right, even for a short time.",
    "output": "If I understand your question correctly, you are saying that in the past you have felt you were following guidance on how to act based on the Course's principles and have, as a result, done unusual things, which you have justified to others as coming from your practice of the Course. And now, since you are not sure if you have really understood and may have been mistaken about what the Course is asking of you, should you acknowledge that to others whom you believe you may have misled about the Course? Furthermore, isn't it possible that you may be called upon to act in unusual ways as a result of your perception of your needs and your guidance? It is very easy to get ourselves all tied up in knots when we become concerned about our behavior, and what is right and what is wrong. The focus on behavior, or form, is one of the ego's clever tricks for keeping us in conflict, pondering what seem to be reasonable questions. And so it is helpful to understand that the Course is never really concerned with modifying or directing our behavior, but only our thoughts (T-2.VI.2-3). And the only distinction the Course makes is whether a thought has its origins in the ego thought system, which would be something that reinforces the belief in separation, differences and guilt, or the Holy Spirit's thought system, which would recognize the common purpose we all share of finding a way out of our confusion and pain, despite all of our differences on the level of form. So the question no longer becomes am I doing everything right or not, but am I looking with my right mind or my wrong mind at whatever I am thinking and doing? If I am feeling guilty and conflict-ridden and confused, I can recognize that's my ego. But if I am clear that the only thing I really need to learn is to look on all choices, both my own and others, without judgment or fear or attack, then I am looking with my right mind. If I make that my focus, the question of what specific behaviors I should carry out will begin to recede in importance. Not that I won't continue to get caught from time to time in focusing my attention on my behavior and its consequences rather than on my thoughts and their consequences. But I will begin to recognize the ego conflict that always underlies that focus on form, and I will begin to ask for help more frequently in looking at the situation differently. There is nothing in the Course that says that you need to acknowledge your mistakes to others. You need to acknowledge your mistakes to yourself and Jesus or the Holy Spirit, so that no guilt is involved. Once you do that, you may or may not be guided to acknowledge them to others. But the latter will not be your focus or concern, when you truly ask for help with releasing your judgments. Now it is possible that, at times when you have done your part to recognize your ego and step back from your identification with it, you may be guided to do something that the world perceives as unusual. But this will not be based on your own needs, as you have identified them, for the Course tells us that our only need is for forgiveness. And in general, it's helpful to know that, with the Course's focus on thought and not behavior, if you are practicing its principles, you will look pretty much like everyone else most of the time. For the only significant work to be done is in our own minds. In the Course's own words, \"There is a way of living in the world that is not here, although it seems to be. You do not change appearance, though you smile more frequently. Your forehead is serene; your eyes are quiet. And the ones who walk the world as you do recognize their own. Yet those who have not yet perceived the way will recognize you also, and believe that you are like them, as you were before\" (W-pI.155.1, italics added)."

    "text_input": "Q #406: In #3, it was stated that if one believes he is still in this world that he should do his best in his role in it. This has bothered me quite a bit. I have been bothered by a voice that began in college that dictated to me what I should do in any situation. As I noticed it I would do the opposite of what it said and follow my gut. I was most surely not \"doing my best\" and was careless in my actions. Others made me feel guilty for this. Over time the guilt became horrible every time I would not listen to the \"reason\" of the voice. I began looking in my past with this voice and I still am haunted constantly with my mind bringing up my actions to this day. A Course in Miracles has been such a release from this torment and this tyranny. Does not the Course say be careless in all things but in forgiveness and love? Doing the best you can to me only implies judgment. Even though I did not do the best I could, in my mind and other people's minds, I have been carried to safety and have been very successful. Please help me to understand this because the Course is my refuge and I don't understand what you mean. It scares me to think the Course might not mean what I think it means.",
    "output": "First of all, rest assured that the statement you refer to from #3 is not meant to be taken as an admonition to evaluate your past and present performances and judge your adequacy or inadequacy in meeting the roles you have assumed. For the Course is never concerned with the specific forms that our lives take and our actions in the world. And it is also not concerned with cataloging the errors of the past as a means of reinforcing our guilt. Its focus is on correcting only one error, which we are making in the present--our ongoing choice for the ego. And everything you describe of your voice for \"reason\" and your reactions to it are nothing more than your ego's attempt to keep you in conflict within yourself and deprive you of peace in the present. Having said that, let's clarify what that statement in #3 about doing your best means. As that question points out, the forms or roles of our lives--although initially chosen to make separation, differences, specialness, and guilt real--become the classrooms in which we learn our forgiveness lessons, once we accept the Holy Spirit as our Teacher. In other words, our roles as student, employee, spouse, parent, etc., are the forms onto which we have projected our unconscious guilt, which now become the means, if we pay attention to our thoughts and reactions to them, for getting back in touch with that buried guilt in our mind. Now it is not that there is some ego-ideal or standard that we should be striving to meet, against which we should be measuring ourselves in terms of fulfilling our roles--that's an ego trap with all its trappings of grandiosity. The point being made here is that it is only a very practical concern with being true to the classroom that we have chosen for ourselves so that we can move more swiftly on our journey back home to the Role God has assigned us as His only Son. If we now or in the past have failed to meet our responsibilities in the world, it is not a sin and should not be employed as a means for reinforcing guilt--that would serve no helpful purpose. But it is helpful to be honest with ourselves--rebelling against the so-called responsibilities of our roles is as much an ego ploy as slavishly trying to conform. Lack of attention or concern about those responsibilities at the level of form is almost always an expression of our authority problem--with the authorities of this world who, in our minds, represent the ultimate Authority, God, from Whom we have attempted to steal our independence and autonomy. And resistance to accepting the responsibility of our roles represents our resistance to uncovering the hidden guilt so that it can be released. Jesus is only asking that we be honest, but he will never condemn us if we're not yet ready to look deeper. As for the quote in the Course about being careless that you refer to, let's look at it in the context of the whole passage: \"You may wonder how you can be at peace when, while you are in time, there is so much that must be done before the way to peace is open. Perhaps this seems impossible to you. But ask yourself if it is possible that God would have a plan for your salvation that does not work. Once you accept His plan as the one function that you would fulfill, there will be nothing else the Holy Spirit will not arrange for you without your effort. He will go before you making straight your path, and leaving in your way no stones to trip on, and no obstacles to bar your way. Nothing you need will be denied you. Not one seeming difficulty but will melt away before you reach it. You need take thought for nothing, careless of everything except the only purpose that you would fulfill. As that was given you, so will its fulfillment be. God's guarantee will hold against all obstacles, for it rests on certainty and not contingency. It rests on you. And what can be more certain than a Son of God?\" (T-20.IV.8; italics added to complete sentence). You may notice that this passage begins by commenting on how much must be done in time. In particular, this is referring to all the special relationships that we must forgive, which include all the roles our lives assume. The key to taking \"thought for nothing, careless of everything\" comes earlier in the paragraph: \"Once you accept His plan as the one function you would fulfill.\" In other words, we will experience no resistance to anything we may seem to be called upon to do in the world because we will know that our only purpose is to forgive. And we will learn to welcome all the seeming challenges our lives present us, recognizing that each, looked at through the eyes of forgiveness, brings us one step closer to home. And so, we need not have care or concern for the form of our lives, because we will know that we are doing the only work that really matters."

    "text_input": "Q #407: The following two questions address the topic of miracles and so will be answered together:  : Jesus did many miracles while he was here on earth, such as raised the dead, made the blind see, etc. Can we, Sons of God, do miracles in this world as well?  : What does A Course in Miracles mean when it says we should offer miracles to others?",
    "output": "Scripture scholars differ in their understanding of the historical accuracy of the Gospel accounts of what Jesus did during his lifetime. However, regardless of the accuracy of the Gospels, the Course teaches a different meaning of miracles. What the Course means by a miracle is a change of mind. It is a course in miracles because it is a course in learning to change our minds from thinking with the ego to thinking with the Holy Spirit. It is a process of undoing the ego by learning a new perspective that reverses the ego's view on everything and everyone. The ego tells us we are bodies, separate from God and from each other, subject to change by external forces. The Holy Spirit tells us we are minds, one with our Father and with each other, subject to change only by the power of the mind to choose. We accept miracles for ourselves to the extent that we accept this teaching, and apply it to all events, situations, and experiences in our lives. We offer miracles to others as we recognize the same power of their minds to choose. As Jesus tells us in the text: \"The miracle extends without your help, but you are needed that it can begin. Accept the miracle of healing, and it will go forth because of what it is. It is its nature to extend itself the instant it is born. And it is born the instant it is offered and received. No one can ask another to be healed. But he can let himself be healed, and thus offer the other what he has received\" (T-27.V.1:2-7). A further extension of this principle is the process of forgiveness, whereby we recognize that nothing external to our minds can cause us to feel anything positive or negative, and therefore, no one is responsible for how we feel. That is what is meant by Jesus' invitation: \"Be willing to forgive the Son of God for what he did not do.\" Thus forgiveness is the miracle we offer to our brothers. In recognizing that our experience is the result of a decision in our minds to identify with the ego or with the Holy Spirit, all our brothers are released from blame, and their innocence is brought to our awareness. This is the miracle of the healing of the mind, given and received."

    "text_input": "Q #408: I am almost through with the workbook and with reading through the text of A Course in Miracles. While I see a dramatic difference in my level of peace and perceptions from when I started, I realize that reading all the way through the text and teacher's manual and going through all the lessons in the workbook isn't the end of working the course. But I don't know where to go from there. Should I start back at the beginning of the text again? Do I simply meditate and listen to the Holy Spirit? What should I do to fully realize the Atonement?",
    "output": "The workbook epilogue agrees with you: \"This course is a beginning, not an end\" (W- pII.ep.1:1). Accepting the Atonement is a process that requires the mind training that is the purpose of the workbook (W-in.1:4), and, as with any training program, patience and perseverance will serve to ensure progress. Once the principles of forgiveness are understood, their effectiveness lies in applying them to every situation, event, and relationship in your life. As long as there is anything that causes any form of upset or distress, no matter how seemingly insignificant it may be, there is need for forgiveness. And so, what follows the initial reading of the Course is a lifetime of practice, practice, practice. Since we are deeply attached to our identities as bodies, and therefore to the thought system of the ego, it does indeed take time and effort to train our minds to think with the Holy Spirit. We are reminded frequently in the Course that our resistance to learning its teachings is considerable. In this regard, we may generalize the message in Lesson 44 to the practice of any of the teachings of the Course: \"...you may find that you will encounter strong resistance. The reason is very simple. While you practice in this way, you leave behind everything that you now believe, and all the thoughts that you have made up. Properly speaking, this is the release from hell. Yet perceived through the ego's eyes, it is loss of identity and a descent into hell\" (W-pI.44.5:2-6). Our practice, therefore, requires careful attention and vigilance in monitoring our minds for every thought and judgment, along with the willingness to let them be transformed by the Holy Spirit, which is how they are undone. Although no structured practice for this is established, once the workbook has been completed, any of the instructions it offers can be used as helpful exercises. Certainly it would be good to do anything that helps you \"stay tuned\" to your thoughts; quiet time, meditation, rereading any part of the Course. Several re-readings of the text are helpful, as its subtleties become clear only when our layers of guilt are removed through the daily practice of forgiveness. As you become familiar with the workbook lessons, they will come to mind during the day. Their effectiveness, however, lies exclusively in your willingness to apply them to whatever situation or relationship in which you find yourself. It is this specific application, in every relationship and event of daily life, that is the true work of a student of the Course. And again, this takes practice, as well as patience and perseverance. A review of the instructions in the introduction to the workbook may be helpful: \"...do not allow yourself to make exceptions in applying the ideas the workbook contains, and whatever your reactions to the ideas may be, use them. Nothing more than that is required\" (W-in.9:4-5)."

    "text_input": "Q #409: I understand how the ego's script plays out and that the Holy Spirit's correction script plays out simultaneously. We can choose the Holy Spirit's script at any time. Is the essence of the Holy Spirit's correction script that it shows us the decision we made for the ego is wrong? Is that how it undoes the ego?",
    "output": "Yes, the Holy Spirit's correction script shows us that our decision for the ego is simply a silly, foolish mistake and has had no effect on what is real--spirit. The Atonement principle, which is another word for the Holy Spirit's correction, simply says the separation never happened (T- 6.II.10:7-8; M-2.2:2-8). The Atonement does nothing but undo our mistaken belief in the ego thought system of sin, guilt and fear. Our minds may translate this gentle principle into a form that we can accept and understand, such as A Course in Miracles, while the thought that the separation and our individuality--and hence the self we think we are--are all illusion is too frightening to embrace. Yet, as we practice the correction over time, we will find more and more that a certain light-heartedness is our experience, as we become increasingly grateful to learn that we have been wrong about sin, guilt and fear. A lovely passage from the workbook, describing the process of salvation, which is yet another word for the correction, expresses this clearly: \"This is the way salvation works. As you step back, the light in you steps forward and encompasses the world. It heralds not the end of sin in punishment and death. In lightness and in laughter is sin gone, because its quaint absurdity is seen. It is a foolish thought, a silly dream, not frightening, ridiculous perhaps, but who would waste an instant in approach to God Himself for such a senseless whim?\" (W-pI.156.6)."

    "text_input": "Q #410: Do you think practices that focus on the physical body (like yoga and other more conventional forms of exercise) are leading me further away from the truth? It seems like these things help me feel better, but am I just deluding myself? Is it just the ego that is feeling better?",
    "output": "There is nothing wrong with doing anything with the body that makes you feel better, whether it's yoga, or walking or other physical exercise, or going to a movie, having a beer, or sex, etc. And the Course would never ask you to give up anything that seems to help you. All that Jesus asks of us is to recognize that, if the Course is our path, the only practice that will truly make us feel better is forgiveness, because it is the only practice that gets to the root of our unhappiness--our belief that we are separate from love, from God, and from each other. We all have to do something with our bodies while we believe we live in them, and it can be a kind and loving thing to care for them in a way that we believe maintains their health and well being. But the bottom line will always be--what is our purpose? If we are focusing on our body to reinforce our specialness, we are setting ourselves up for pain and suffering. A sobering passage towards the end of the text makes this clear: \"Ask yourself this: Can you protect the mind? The body, yes, a little; not from time, but temporarily. And much you think you save, you hurt. What would you save it for? For in that choice lie both its health and harm. Save it for show, as bait to catch another fish, to house your specialness in better style, or weave a frame of loveliness around your hate, and you condemn it to decay and death\" (T-24.VII.4:1-6). The reason for this is not punitive, as the ego would want us to believe, but simply the inevitable consequences of identifying with a thought system that reinforces the belief in loss and limitation as a result of separation, as the following explains: \"Whenever you attempt to reach a goal in which the body's betterment is cast as major beneficiary, you try to bring about your death. For you believe that you can suffer lack, and lack is death\" (T-29.VII.4:1-2; see also T-19.IV-B.12). The problem is not with taking care of the body as we think we need to. It would be foolish, for example, to stop eating or drinking simply because they happen to be the imagined needs of a mind that believes it is separate and housed in a body. The problem arises when our focus on the body is to maintain it for the purpose of attack--either for special love or for special hate--that is, as a means to meet our own needs at someone else's expense, seeing our interests as separate from everyone else's. And an honest starting point would be to acknowledge that, for most of us, most of the time, that in fact is our focus. But the correction would not be to eliminate the physical activity we are engaging in to help improve our body, but rather to ask for help in looking at the mental activity that we are buying into that tells us that using others can bring us happiness. If we look honestly, we will see the lie beneath that argument and it will diminish in its appeal to us. And then, with a different Thought behind our actions, one that points to the genuine benefits that come from recognizing our shared interest with all our brothers, our body can then become a medium for sharing that message with others, not through any specific words or actions, but through our attitude of love and peace."

    "text_input": "Q #411: In A Course in Miracles, Jesus says, \"You cannot make the body the Holy Spirit's temple, and it will never be the seat of love. It is the home of the idolater, and of love's condemnation. For here is love made fearful and hope abandoned\" (T-20.VI.6:1-3). And previous to that he states of idols, specifically referring to the body that \"The body is the ego's chosen weapon for seeking power through relationships\" (T-20.VI.4:3). The other day I saw a woman who was pregnant and it made me think of birth, pregnancy, the separation, and what purpose birth serves. Is not the birthing of another body extending the thought of separation since the body is \"the ego's chosen weapon for seeking power?\" Aren't we just making the thoughts of separation greater and the illusion/dream more so through the birth of a body?",
    "output": "It would seem so; but in the passages you have cited, Jesus is speaking to us on what we refer to as Level One: the contrast between reality and illusion. On that level, the body symbolizes only the ego's murderous nature and its ongoing intention to perpetuate separation and conflict; and therefore in and of itself, the body can never be anything holy or loving. But on another level (Level Two), speaking to us within the framework of what we think is real, Jesus teaches us that \"love does not condemn it [the body] and can use it lovingly, respecting what the Son of God has made and using it to save him from illusions\" (T-18.VI.4:8). His gentle means of helping us is to teach us how to use what we regard as real (even though he knows it is not real and was made to attack truth) to undo the sense of separation we feel within ourselves and in relation to everyone else. He thus tells us to regard the world and the body first as neutral (W-pII.294), and then to concentrate on the purpose of what we think and do; and that purpose will always be a variation of one of two themes: the reinforcement of our belief in separation or of the undoing of that belief through forgiveness. As we progress in this way of thinking, we will gradually and naturally begin to disidentify with the body, until we finally accept its total unreality. Thus our lives become classrooms in which we choose either the ego or Jesus as our teacher. Seen from this perspective, then, birthing--as with anything else--can be in accord with the ego's purpose for us or with Jesus' purpose: a wrong-minded choice or a right-minded choice. This is what we refer to as Level Two: wrong-minded versus right-minded choices within the dream of separation. So when you see a pregnant woman, just watch your own thoughts, remembering that you do not know what her specific Atonement path involves. That could be the classroom she has chosen in which to learn her specific lessons of forgiveness. In that sense, your thoughts could be along these lines: \"We both believe we are here, which means we both believe we rejected our true Identity and left our home in Heaven in order to establish an independent separate existence of our own; and we both have within us the means and all the help we need to correct our mistake and return Home. The specifics of our lives may be different, but our purpose is the same, and Jesus' loving help is equally present to both of us.\" One last thought. To think that separation can be made worse is to make the error real--the cardinal \"sin\" of Course students! Linear time is one of the ego's cleverest tricks to make us think that our experience is fresh and real. It is just another way to validate our existence as individuals. Orienting us in the right direction, Jesus tells us that we \"but see the journey from the point at which it ended, looking back on it, imagining we make it once again; reviewing mentally what has gone by\" (W-pI.158.4:5). In that sense, we cannot make the separation greater or increase the illusion. Our awakening from this dream of separation, however, is dependent on the purpose for which we use the world and our bodies. In that sense, we can reinforce in our own minds our false identity as individual selves, or we can gradually undo this false identity with help from Jesus or the Holy Spirit in our practice of forgiveness. Giving birth to a baby is inherently neutral--it the purpose behind that decision that establishes its Atonement relevance. Pardon the pun, but you don't want to throw the baby out with the bath water, a temptation practically all students of the Course fall prey to, when their egos blind their eyes to the two distinct levels on which Jesus speaks to us."

    "text_input": "Q #412: I am in a state of confusion that I think borders on depression at times. I completed A Course in Miracles two months ago. I now wonder, due to my reactions to things, whether I completed it correctly--whether I paid enough attention to the lessons. I am ashamed to have these thoughts for I know that it goes against the aims of the Course. I still get angry and when I am not getting angry I am stuffing my anger down. It seems as though I have just missed the whole point because my reactions and actions are way off. How do I deal with my children's outright disobedience and still follow the Course? It seems that I am required to let them get away with everything because none of it is real, but it feels very real to me. I don't know whether it is me being petty or them requiring discipline and guidance. I also become very scared when I think about living my life as the Course instructs. I wouldn't know what choices to make; I wouldn't know what was important anymore. Should I care about money, my house, myself, my husband, etc. What is real?",
    "output": "\"This course is a beginning, not an end\" is how Jesus concludes the workbook (W-pII.ep.1:1). The workbook is a one-year training program that basically orients us and gives us what we need to continue our learning and practicing for the rest of our lives. Thus, at the end of one year, we have really just begun our work, as dismaying as that thought might be. We are not expected to have transcended our egos and mastered the Course after just one year, although Jesus says things that would lead us to think that. Jesus stands outside time and space altogether and sees us from a completely different perspective than we do. He knows that on one level we have already \"made it\"; and so sometimes he speaks through that vision. But by and large, his message to us is to see our lives now as classrooms in which we will spend all of our days learning how to look at our ego in action without judging it--how to take our ego less and less seriously. It is true that none of this is real, but we do not believe that--especially after only one year of working with the Course--and so Jesus teaches us how to go about our lives in such a way that we will reach that ultimate point of realization, after many, many, many years of practice. This is not a Course in denying our perceptions and feelings. Jesus wants us to see our perceptions and our experiences as the curriculum he can work with to help us. It is only through our daily experiences--what we perceive as real--that he can gradually and gently lead us beyond them; so it would be detrimental to your spiritual progress to pretend that you believe the world is not real, because the Course says it isn't, when you really do not believe that at all. Many students confuse these levels in the Course and wind up in the same kind of anguish and confusion you are experiencing. Please remember that the goal of the Course is not to be without an ego. The goal is to escape the burden of guilt we have placed upon ourselves for our murderous, vicious, and hateful ego choices (M-26.4:1-2). That is the primary way in which we will eventually learn that our original decision to leave God was nothing more than a \"tiny, mad idea.\" Denying our experiences and how we truly feel leaves Jesus or the Holy Spirit with no means of helping us. We must be aware of what is in need of correction before we can accept Their gentle, loving correction of our mistaken thoughts. Jesus talks to us about this very early in the text: \"The body is merely part of your experience in the physical world ... it is almost impossible to deny its existence in this world. Those who do so are engaging in a particularly unworthy form of denial. The term 'unworthy' here implies only that it is not necessary to protect the mind by denying the unmindful\" (T-2.IV.3:8,10-12). Specifically, this means that when--not if--you get angry or upset with your children, you would know that the least helpful thing you can do is judge yourself or feel that you are failing the Course. Getting angry is not the problem. Feeling guilty because you got angry is the problem. That is the mistake you are making, because you are giving the ego a reality it does not truly have. Jesus never asks us not to get angry; he asks only that we not justify it by claiming \"I couldn't help it; look what happened!\" or something along those lines. When we condemn ourselves for having ego attacks, we are playing right into the ego's hands and preventing ourselves from taking the one step that would free us from the ego forever, which is to realize that our anger is a projection of our self-hatred, which itself is a defense against the love that is the only true reality in our minds. So, again, your practice should involve stepping back as best you can and observing your ego without judging it. That is how you will begin the process of rejoining the love in your mind, for you will be deciding against the ego by not being ashamed of yourself for still having an ego. Then you are being a good Course in Miracles student. There is no way to flunk this Course--except one, that is: you flunk this Course by thinking that flunking this Course is possible! The thought that you can be a failure in Jesus' eyes is deserving only of laughter. You might want to look at #179, which discusses normal parenting in the context of Course principles."

Could you please explain the difference between allowing yourself to be used as a doormat, and what the Course is trying to teach in regard to dealing with situations where it's necessary to be assertive, to acknowledge yourself as an equal in accord with God's will?",
    "output": "Misusing the Course to avoid conflict is a common mistake among its students. This is a form of denial, and is in direct opposition to a very important goal of the Course, which is to teach us to pay attention to the conflict in our lives. This is one of the ways in which A Course in Miracles is a unique spiritual path. It tells us that by looking at conflict we learn to recognize the hidden, unconscious beliefs we hold about ourselves and others, all of which stem from the belief that the separation is real. Our conflicts are generally riddled with judgments, feelings, and thoughts, reflecting the conflict in our minds caused by the choice to believe the ego's lies about who we are as bodies, thus denying our true Identity as God's innocent Son. As long as we are unaware of this conflict in the mind, it cannot be brought to the Holy Spirit for healing. This is the purpose the Course gives to conflict in our lives, and it is the only way it can truly be resolved. Because the Course is showing us the real source of conflict is the unhealed mind, it does not tell us how to deal with it on the level of form, to which you are referring. We are asked to be willing to recognize all the thoughts, beliefs and feelings that come up in any situation, seeing that they reflect the choice in the mind to identify with the ego thought system, and be willing to question them in the light of the Course's teachings. We are not asked to do anything on the level of form. Trying to act in a way that seems spiritual or appears to be in accord with the metaphysical principles of the Course (i.e., keeping silent when mistreated) while still identifying with the ego's thought system, is unproductive, and leaves you feeling like a doormat. That is certainly not the experience to which Jesus is leading us. Moreover, if you are a victim, there must be a victimizer, thereby reinforcing separation. The Course tells us we are not only \"equal\"; we are one. We will know this when all the forms by which we perceive ourselves to be separate and different from one another have been forgiven. Until then, we continue to practice forgiveness. It is possible to assert yourself and remain faithful to the Course, because it is no different from doing any of the things you do to take care of yourself physically, emotionally or psychologically. Asserting yourself without attack is a way to acknowledge your need to be treated respectfully, as well as the other's need for the same treatment, thereby reinforcing the belief that we have no separate interests. As long as we do believe we are bodies, we interact with others according to normal behavioral standards. This means not denying any of our feelings or perceived needs, which would only deprive us of opportunities to learn and to forgive. The Course cautions us very early in the text: \"The body is merely part of your experience in the physical world ... it is almost impossible to deny its existence in this world. Those who do so are engaging in a particularly unworthy form of denial\" (T-2.IV.3:8,10-11)."

I do believe there is more here than meets the eye and that healing is within my control/power. I would appreciate any insight you can share on the \"reason\" for apparent accidents, and healing from accidental injuries. Can you possibly shed some light on this issue, from the viewpoint of A Course in Miracles?",
    "output": "This is one of the more difficult aspects of the Course's theory to both understand and accept, the primary reason being that we always attempt to comprehend what the Course says from the perspective of homo sapiens, forgetting that the ego's purpose for homo sapiens is to keep the Son of God mindless and forever oblivious to the dynamics that sustain and motivate \"life\" in the world, ensuring that he would never realize that his experiences are the outcome of his own choice. The world \"never was, nor is, nor yet will be what you imagine\" Jesus once told Helen (The Gifts of God, p. 117)--echoing Plato, perhaps. So it is important to remember that the Son of God does not equate with homo sapiens or the brain; the Son of God equates with mind. In \"The Responsibility for Sight\" Jesus states: \"Deceive yourself no longer that you are helpless in the face of what is done to you ... It is impossible the Son of God be merely driven by events outside of him. It is impossible that happenings that come to him were not his choice\" (T- 21.II.2:6; 3:1-2). And then in that same section, he offers us some insight into why we (as decision-making minds outside time and space) would choose suffering: \"Suffer, and you [as mind] decided sin was your goal. Be happy and you gave the power of decision to Him Who must decide for God for you\" (T-21.II.3:5-6). Sin, which is always equated with separation in A Course in Miracles, therefore is a motivating factor: all suffering proves that separation is reality. Another motivating factor is given several paragraphs later: \"Nothing created not by your Creator has any influence over you. And if you think what you have made [the body] can tell you what you see and feel, and place your faith in its ability to do so, you are denying your Creator and believing that you made yourself. For if you think the world you made has power to make you what it wills, you are confusing Son and Father; effect and Source\" (T-21.II.11:3-5). Any time we feel we are victims of accidental happenings, we are being motivated by this ancient and concealed quest to usurp God's role as Creator and claim His power as our own. That sounds monstrous and there usually is nothing about our experience that validates this. But Jesus says in many ways throughout his Course that we should not trust our perceptions or our experience, until they are no longer ours but his from outside the dream. So, insanely, we (as mind) confirm our existence and autonomy by subjecting ourselves to forces seemingly beyond our control. Once again, the decision-making mind outside time and space is not a human self or brain. This is impossible for us to envision, but as such, the mind can express its intention in any number of different forms, one of which is as seemingly different entities collectively involved in events and situations. #37 explains this in depth, specifically the \"secret vow\" we make to be hurt by another (T-28.VI.4-5). Ultimately, \"accidents\" involving several people are the outward picture of a decision made in the mind. The ego's strategy to keep the separation from God real, while projecting responsibility for it, is effectively carried out in these human scenarios where people suffer as innocent victims of accidental happenings. Without minimizing people's pain, seen from a perspective outside the dream of separation, accidents, tragedies, and hideous catastrophes are still only smokescreens meant to obscure our identity as decision-making minds so that we would never realize that we are but following the way we chose (W-pI.166.6), and therefore we can make another choice. Healing from \"accidental injuries\" would proceed along the lines of any other type of healing; namely, that you would focus on which teacher you are choosing to guide you through your recovery. True healing is always the acceptance of the Atonement--that the separation never truly happened. And we make our way toward that final stage by searching our minds for all the ways in which we uphold separation and separate interests. Interacting with your doctors and others who are helping you provides a wonderful opportunity to join in terms of sharing a common interest. And because all forms of sickness and pain are also defenses \"protecting\" you from your Identity as spirit, you also would want to be a patient patient, respectful of your fear of returning to the Home you never truly left. You just want to be gentle with yourself, with the love of Jesus beside you, accepting where you are and letting go any blame that tempts you to judge yourself or others."

    "text_input": "Q #417: Is a desire or expectation or agreement for sexual fidelity in a relationship a hallmark of the ego's special relationship--a kind of possessiveness that seeks to own the other person and limit the expression of universal love? I have always avoided infidelity, not only for health reasons, but also because it seems to churn up disruptive and painful emotions. My partner comes from a background in his young adulthood where sex was considered a way of achieving union with others in his spiritual circle in addition to his spouse. And in relation to this, is it possible to truly forgive someone as a spiritual being, and believe the sincerity of their vow to act differently, and yet still feel insurmountable doubts about the person's moral appropriateness as a life partner? Or is such a feeling the product of fear and being stuck in the past? My inner voice advised me that he was not the right person for me and that I was resisting that fact and that he would never be the right person for me and to end the relationship. How can I tell if this is the Voice of the Holy Spirit?",
    "output": "While the expectation/desire for sexual fidelity could express the ego's version of love, which is characterized by possessiveness and exclusion, it could also express the Holy Spirit's purpose for the relationship, in the sense that this is the person with whom you are going to learn your lessons of forgiveness. Having sex only with this one person, therefore, could symbolize that commitment to heal the separation with this specific learning partner. And since the content in your mind is the healing of the separation, no one would be excluded from that healing. To avoid confusion and reduce the potential for self-deception, it is essential to distinguish between form and content. The content in our wrong minds is always generated by the ego's goal of keeping the separation intact, which it does primarily by devising ways to keep the body and its behavior (form) real in our perception. Sex fits nicely into this strategy, especially when it is spiritualized, for then a function of the body has been sanctified, and the ego's triumph thus assured. This is why Jesus reminds us that \"minds are joined, bodies are not\" (T-18.VI.3:1). We do not have to achieve union with others, we simply have to recognize how we are blocking awareness of that union, which is the eternal, unchangeable nature of our oneness as God's Son. On the level of absolute truth, the body and everything about the body is totally illusory. But since we continue to believe we are real as bodies, Jesus helps us correct that mistaken belief by having us regard the body as neutral, so we can then concentrate as much as possible on the purpose for which we use the body: to separate or to heal the separation. Thus nothing of the body can be holy or unholy; the act of sex is neither holy nor unholy, even though many people tend to spiritualize it. The content in the mind is the critical factor. It is often difficult to discern the purpose or the content, though, because of the intense emotional and psychological aspects of sex, rooted ultimately in our guilt-ridden separation from God and the usurping of His creative power, manifested in the \"pro-creative\" dimension of sex. All of our problems and preoccupation with sex are linked with these ontological associations. The process can often be simplified, however, by divorcing sex from its physical expression. Thus, issues of infidelity should be dealt with on the deeper level of content, rather than the behavioral level. It is not having an affair with someone else that is wrong; the question of right or wrong in this regard needs to be addressed at a much deeper level. There needs to be complete clarity on the level of content; this cannot be decided simply by assessing behavior. The content that defines the relationship needs to be looked at with complete honesty and objectivity. (The wrong-minded content would be guilt, control, or any other aspect of specialness.) Finally, how can you tell if you are truly being guided by the Holy Spirit, and not by the ego masquerading as a divine source? The way to discern this is, as best you can, get all of the interferences out of the way--all the anger, fear, feelings of betrayal, jealousy, etc. You need not be free of them permanently, but just for an instant let them go, because your holding on to them is the cause of the disruption of the communication between you and the Holy Spirit. The topic of sex is discussed in depth in our audio and video of Kenneth's workshop, \"Form and Content: Sex and Money\"; and also in Chapter 4 of Forgiveness and Jesus: The Meeting Place of A Course in Miracles and Christianity."

    "text_input": "Q #418: What does the statement \"reflection of Love\" mean? If there is no love in this world, how can you tell what is a reflection of love? Many students of A Course in Miracles I know run around saying they are \"extending\" love. They do this by acts and deeds and thoughts. This doesn't seem to be what the Course is saying. If there is no love in the world, how can one extend love in the world? I can understand there being no love in the world since God is Love, and God knows not of this world. But this reflection thing seems to hang me up. Can you help?",
    "output": "It is important to remember that when the Course speaks about the extension or the reflection of love, it is addressing the mind that chooses to identify with the part of the mind that remembers God, not the separate individual who identifies with the body in the dream. In reality, the Son cannot be separate from the Father and cannot obliterate memory of Him; therefore, a part of the mind holds the memory of God. It is this part which is a reflection of God's Love. When the mind chooses to identify with this love, it flows through the figure in the dream and is thereby extended. It is not limited by form of any kind, but takes the form which is most helpful in any situation and to anyone. This is not an act of will, nor a choice on the part of an individual to perform specific \"loving acts,\" as we may define them. It is unlikely that those who identify with the part of the mind that reflects God's Love would run around saying they are \"extending\" love. If they do, hopefully they are aware that \"they\" are not the ones doing the extending. The figure in the dream does nothing. We are not asked to use our judgment to evaluate any situation or to determine what is or is not a loving response. As the Course reminds us clearly and repeatedly, our function is forgiveness. It is practiced by recognizing all the unloving thoughts and judgments we may have, asking for them to be transformed by the Holy Spirit. We then do what the Course invites us to do: \"Step gently aside, and let healing be done for you. Keep but one thought in mind and do not lose sight of it, however tempted you may be to judge any situation, and to determine your response by judging it. Focus your mind only on this: I am not alone, and I would not intrude the past upon my Guest. I have invited Him, and He is here. I need do nothing except not to interfere.\" (T-16.I.3:7-12). Once we have arrived at this noninterference, all that is left is the reflection of love."

    "text_input": "Q #419: Sabotage is a big issue with me. It doesn't matter what the form is, I just ruin things for myself. Needless to say, the consequences of continually sabotaging myself are always regretful and sad and the more they are recalled in my mind the more guilty I feel. I have grown very weary of my self. Can you please elaborate on the subject of sabotage?",
    "output": "Speaking in general, because we do not know you personally, self-sabotage is usually motivated by hidden ego dynamics, such as: (1) The need to punish yourself for the \"sin\" of attacking Love in order to have your own existence. This would cause you to think that you do not deserve to be happy for any extended period of time. And, further, following the ego's story, you would think that God would be more pleased with you if He saw that you had a rough life. Thus you would be willing to pay for your sinfulness through a life filled with failure and misfortune. (2) The need to prove that your life as an individual is real and is the truth about you. Thus, being weary of being you says you are still you, and you are not as God created you. (3) The need to hold someone else responsible for your miserable life. If you dig beneath the surface, more than likely you will find yourself blaming your self-destructive pattern on something in your past, or some other factor for which you are not responsible. That would again fulfill the ego's aim of sustaining the separation but not taking responsibility for it. The application of forgiveness to this painful condition involves first acknowledging that there must be an unconscious need within you to reinforce this self-concept, and that it obviously is coming from your identification with the ego. In that sense, you (the decision-making mind identified with the ego), are simply carrying out your own strategy. Gentleness in looking at these thoughts within yourself is essential if you are to begin the process of healing, and asking help of Jesus or the Holy Spirit would ensure that you would look without judgment. Being weary of yourself is already a judgment, because it is saying this is who you truly are, and to some extent you are a helpless victim. To get beyond that, all you need to do is say and feel as objectively as you can: \"This is where I am, and for some insane reason I must believe that this is helping me achieve something of value. This does not make be a bad person or a sinful person, just mistaken. I clearly have chosen the ego as my teacher and am simply following its guidance.\" If you could do that without any judgment whatsoever, you would be making progress in lessening your investment in the ego thought system, and you would not be worsening the situation by trying to fight yourself. This patient acceptance of yourself would then give you some \"breathing space,\" and then at some point you would be able to get in touch with these deeper layers of motivation and ask for help to see them differently, from a healing perspective in your right mind. Finally, it is never wrong or out of keeping with your commitment to A Course in Miracles to seek help from a therapist. Sometimes successful behavioral changes lessen psychological pressures enough so that you can then work on the underlying dynamics such as the ones outlined above."

    "text_input": "Q #420: In A Course in Miracles Jesus says: \"I have great need for lilies, for the Son of God has not forgiven me. And can I offer him forgiveness when he offers thorns to me? For he who offers thorns to anyone is against me still, and who is whole without him? Be you his friend for me, that I may be forgiven and you may look upon the Son of God as whole\" (T-20.II.4:1-4). I am not entirely sure what Jesus needs us to forgive him for. What has he done? Is it not we who should be asking him to forgive us that in our insane wrong-mindedness we were and still are mistaken about his and our identity?",
    "output": "First, in the passage you quote, Jesus is teaching us again that the Sonship is one: we cannot attack another person without simultaneously attacking ourselves and him. Now with regard to forgiving Jesus... We will give a brief answer here and then suggest some references for an in- depth study of this important topic. There are two levels on which we need to forgive Jesus--all based on what he tells us in the Course. The first level pertains to our projections onto him, the \"bitter idols\" he mentions in the clarification of terms at the end of the manual for teachers (C- 5.5:7). On the one hand, we (the world) have made him into a figure of judgment and punishment who demands suffering and sacrifice. On the other hand, we have made him into a magical savior who will solve our problems, and reward us for our faith and our good deeds. These two images, of course, are prominent in the New Testament, and have been throughout the history of Christianity. On this first level, then, we need to forgive Jesus for what he has never done and for what he has never been. This really is a defense against the more basic underlying level, which is our need to forgive Jesus for who he truly is, as he reveals himself in A Course in Miracles, thus correcting the distorted and mistaken descriptions given in most religions for the past two thousand years. If Jesus is indeed present within our minds as the reflection of God's Love--the pure expression of the Atonement principle--then our entire identity as a separated physical and psychological being is undone. He is the living proof within our dream that we are wrong about everything, that our individual lives and the entire world are made up. He has not come to help us make our lives in the world better. When we allow ourselves to look honestly at who Jesus truly is and what he truly represents, we could not but react with fear and even hatred. So it is because of who he truly is that our forgiveness of him is needed. In this sense, we can all relate to the profound feelings expressed in Helen's poem \"Stranger on the Road,\" in which she portrays her fear of confronting the truth of Jesus' reality. There is much more to say about this aspect of our relationship with Jesus, but space limitations prevent us from doing so here, and so we refer you to some of our publications for further study: Question #54 in The Most Commonly Asked Questions about A Course in Miracles; \"Why Must We Forgive Jesus?\" in Chapter 15 of Forgiveness and Jesus: The Meeting Place of A Course in Miracles and Christianity; The \"Afterword\" in the second edition of Christian Psychology in A Course in Miracles, and \"Forgiving Jesus: Stranger on the Road,\" an audio album."

    "text_input": "Q #421: I have been studying A Course in Miracles for some months now, and I learned that mistakes are undone by looking at them. To become aware of my mistakes, I try to be aware of phrases like \"They shouldn't do it this way\" or \"You should behave like this.\" I believe that as I become aware of wanting to control others around me, these phrases will disappear. Is this technique helpful in suspending judgment, or do they themselves imply judgment?",
    "output": "Paying attention to the things you think and say is a very good way to practice the vigilance the Course teaches. It is a very important part of the mind training of the Course. What these thoughts and words reflect are the beliefs and judgments of the ego thought system which is based on the belief that the separation is real. This belief is the original mistake, which gives rise to all subsequent mistakes in judgment. Becoming aware of the specific form the thought of separation takes in all of our relationships is how we get in touch with the choice which has been made in the mind. In the example you give, wanting to control others reflects the desire to \"control\" ourselves by deciding who we are, rather than accepting the Identity given to us by God. Because we have dissociated ourselves from the power of choice in our minds, the only way for us to know what we have chosen is through its effects in our relationships and interactions in the dream. They show us whether we have chosen to believe the ego's interpretation of our identity (separated and guilty bodies) or the Holy Spirit's (God's one innocent Son). This is why becoming aware of them is an important step in their undoing. However, it is not the end of the process: \"In order to heal, it thus becomes essential for the teacher of God to let all his own mistakes be corrected. If he senses even the faintest hint of irritation in himself as he responds to anyone, let him instantly realize that he has made an interpretation that is not true. Then let him turn within to his eternal Guide, and let Him judge what the response should be\" (M-18.4:1-3). Once we are aware of our mistaken beliefs and judgments, they do not automatically disappear. We have an important choice to make: we either keep them, or exchange them for the Holy Spirit's correction. The first choice reinforces the ego's thought system, which is the source of all the pain experienced in the world of illusion. The second leads to the undoing of the ego's belief in separation by weakening our investment in it. As we begin to realize the tremendous cost of maintaining our mistaken belief in the separation (pain and conflict), we become more willing to choose the Holy Spirit's correction: \"Heaven is chosen consciously. The choice cannot be made until alternatives are accurately seen and understood. All that is veiled in shadows must be raised to understanding, to be judged again, this time with Heaven's help. And all mistakes in judgment that the mind had made before are open to correction, as the truth dismisses them as causeless. Now are they without effects. They cannot be concealed, because their nothingness is recognized\" (W-pI.138.9:1-5)."

    "output": "Yes, the mind can be thought of as the thing that thinks. It is outside time and space, as distinguished from the brain, which is an organ in the body. The mind's thinking affirms, through its decision-making power, either the ego's thought system or the Holy Spirit's. And it must always be remembered that this kind of thinking is a function only of the mind of the separated Son, and therefore is illusory, because the Son never truly separated. We therefore could say that the Mind of Christ, in Heaven, has nothing to think about! There is no counterpart in our human experience to the perfect oneness of reality, as some mystics have observed."

    "text_input": "Q #423: Does anyone feel some sense of alienation in everyday life from studying A Course in Miracles? I thought all of my relationships would be strengthened by following this path. Instead I've had more turmoil in that area than I ever have had in my life. It hurts when you are not invited to the party because you have chosen to \"see things differently.\"",
    "output": "Choosing the Holy Spirit's perception instead of the ego's should result in your feeling more peaceful, and that is all that should be \"noticeable\" to others. As Jesus states in Lesson 155: \"There is a way of living in the world that is not here, although it seems to be. You do not change appearance, though you smile more frequently. Your forehead is serene; your eyes are quiet. And the ones who walk the world as you do recognize their own. Yet those who have not yet perceived the way will recognize you also, and believe that you are like them, as you were before\" (W-pI.155.1). Smiling more frequently and being more peaceful should not result in a feeling of alienation. However, if all that you and your friends did together was criticize and judge others, and you have chosen not to do that any more, then the form of the relationship might change as well, if you are being guided to leave the relationship. This should not result in a feeling of alienation, though. On the other hand, the politics and judgment that are inherent in almost all relationships in this world do not necessarily mean that you cannot be friends with these people any longer or that you need to move on. You can be silent and not indulge in the attacks and still be very much present to your friends. The content in your mind can change, without the form of the relationship necessarily changing. You could approach a get-together, for example, as a classroom in which you are going to learn that you and your friends share the same interests on a deeper level. So when the judging starts, you can say within your mind: \"That is what egos do. They judge. I may not be engaging in the judging right now, but I have the same ego and am expressing it in other ways. That makes us all the same. And they and I share the same right mind, too, along with the power to choose. All of us attacked God or we would not be here, and we all want to return home, but are afraid to.\" By seeing that as the constant purpose of your being with your friends, you would learn how to be with them without supporting their egos, without feeling superior to them (an attack), and without feeling alienated. It is your laboratory, you might say, for applying what you have learned."

    "text_input": "Q #424: You say that if Jesus were active in the world today he would be as silly as we are. Now, surely he wasn't silly 2,000 years ago when he was very active in this world. So why can't we assume that he is as active today for us as he was then, except with the huge advantage that today he can be so everywhere, simultaneously. Or is my assumption wrong that Jesus was active in the world 2,000 years ago? Was it only our faith in him that brought about all the miracles, practically without his interference? But he says that he raised the dead, so he must have been active on the level of form to some extent. In other words, would he be as active for us today as he was then, if we had the same faith in him today, as we had then? Please help me in this confusion because I do feel that he is active in this world today and that is contrary to what you are saying.",
    "output": "Your confusion is understandable, because the Bible and A Course in Miracles have completely different views of the nature of the world and of Jesus, and you seem to be combining them. From the point of view of A Course in Miracles, Jesus could not be active in the world, because he himself emphatically states, \"There is no world! This the central thought the course attempts to teach\" (W-pI.132.6:2-3). His theory and his training of us through the lessons help us move toward acceptance of that truth by focusing on the world as but a projection of a thought of guilt in our minds, and as such it has no reality of itself. That is the significance of these principles: ideas leave not their source and \"the world is the outside picture of an inward condition\" (T-21.in.1:5). We therefore are deluded when we take anything of the world or the body seriously. In fact, many times Jesus uses the term insane in reference to us, because we are always reacting to something that is not there. So if Jesus were active in a world he says does not exist, he would be as silly as we are. Even as a presence in our minds he is not active. We may experience him as active--as doing things--but that is only because of our limitations and our need to make love more manageable by us, as Jesus gently chided Helen Schucman for doing. The Course teaches us that Jesus is in our minds only as a reflection of the presence of Love that we rejected when we decided that we wanted to be on our own, rather than be part of the pure Oneness of God's Being. His love is present in our minds for us to accept back or to continue to reject, but it will always be there, regardless of our choosing against it. So Jesus does nothing except love us unconditionally. How we experience that love depends on our own inner dynamics. As our fear lessens and we allow ourselves to identify with that love more and more, we will realize it is but our own Self, not a separate person with the name \"Jesus.\" Love is one. God's Son is one. And miracles pertain only to our minds--the choice we make in our minds to reverse our decision to make separation our reality. The Bible's accounts of Jesus' life and activities have been studied by scholars for quite some time, and one conclusion widely accepted is that these accounts should not be taken literally. Of course there are many Christians who believe the opposite. But as one Catholic scholar put it: \"I would swear that Jesus performed miracles, but I would not swear that he performed any of the miracles described in the gospels.\" In the Course, Jesus alludes to some of his \"activities\" when he was on earth, but he also says: The name of Jesus is the name of one who was a man but saw the face of Christ in all his brothers and remembered God. So he became identified with Christ, a man no longer, but at one with God. The man was an illusion, for he seemed to be a separate being, walking by himself, within a body that appeared to hold his self from Self, as all illusions do. Yet who can save unless he sees illusions and then identifies them as what they are? Jesus remains a Savior because he saw the false without accepting it as true. And Christ needed his form that He might appear to men and save them from their own illusions\" (C-5.2). Now you don't want to throw the baby out with the bath water, as the saying goes. Jesus himself urges us to relate to him as a dear and loving brother, who wants to help us. And he can help us because he is wiser than we are, and motivated only by love. He speaks of walking with us and taking our hand as we journey along the path of forgiveness with him. \"Walking with him is just as natural as walking with a brother whom you knew since you were born, for such indeed he is\" (C-5.5:6). And as long as we think we are individuals living in the world, then we ought to relate to him that way. But he does not want us to remain on that level, because we would be limiting ourselves to only a very small portion of the gifts he offers us. He wants to help us let go of our identity with a false self that has led us into an alien world filled with immense suffering, conflict, and hatred, along with temporary moments of happiness and pleasure. He wants to take us Home, and the way we will get there is by learning how to see everything the way he does. Seeing him only as a kind and caring person who will fix our lives and the world--though that is not a bad place to start one's spiritual journey--is to severely limit the joy and peace that is our inheritance as God's Son, and that is immeasurably beyond any joy and peace we might experience in the world. Your question touches on the very purpose of A Course in Miracles, and we recommend further study of what we have briefly outlined here. See Questions #93, #97, #184, #241, #420; Absence from Felicity, Chapter 17; and The Message of A Course in Miracles, Chapter 4."

    "text_input": "Q #425: My question is about compassion. According to Buddhism, compassion is the most divine feature and one of the means leading to enlightenment. But according to A Course in Miracles, suffering and pain are illusions. So from that point of view compassion seems to play on the ego's side, enforcing the illusion. But what would our world be without compassion?",
    "output": "First, as a clarification, the Course's teachings come on two levels. On the level of absolute truth, suffering and compassion are both illusory, because God alone is real in the perfect Oneness of His infinite Love, extended in Christ, His creation, and in the creations of Christ, forever within the unity of God's Being. All but this eternally extending Love is illusory. Succinctly stated, the second level of the Course's teachings addresses us as minds erroneously thinking that reality is defined by existence separate from and outside the Being of God: separate, autonomous beings with separate interests. The purpose of these teachings, thus, is to help us undo these mistaken, delusional beliefs that we are separate from one another and have conflicting interests and goals. On this level, the Course would agree with Buddhism in its high regard for compassion. The terminology would be a little different, but learning to be compassionate is a vital part of any student's work with A Course in Miracles. In fact, a workshop given at the Foundation in 2001 was called \"The Compassion of the Miracle,\" and our newsletter, The Lighthouse, has featured several articles on compassion and kindness. Compassion, when extended to all people and circumstances without exception, is spiritually healing because it reverses the separation we perceive among us. It reinforces the illusion when it is offered only to those deemed worthy of it, and is withheld from those judged as undeserving of our love and kindness. The compassion in our world today all too often is laced with unkindness because it is exclusionary. Not uncommonly, the very people who would spend considerable time, energy, and money helping one group, would turn a cold shoulder to another group suffering the same plight, only because this second group espouses a different political or religious view or a different life style. Our compassion pours out to the suffering, but rarely extends to those who have inflicted that suffering. From the Course's point of view, if we were to get beyond the behavior (form) to the content in people's minds, we would find that we are all identical. Even those responsible for the most hideous of crimes share the very same thought system as those who devote their lives to helping the victims, which of course does not make hideous behavior acceptable. What appear to be separate, autonomous beings are but fragments of the one thought of separation, along with the guilt and fear inherent in that thought. All cruelty, brutality, and savagery are ultimately traceable to the dynamics resulting from this belief. We all share in that thought system; but we all--without exception--share in the correction of that insanity as well. Both thought systems--with the power to choose between them--define the mind of every single seemingly individual being. Undoing our belief in separation thus involves a growing perception that there is only one Son of God, and therefore if we condemn one person or group, we are really condemning ourselves. That is the basis of the Course's view of compassion. Finally, if we keep form and content distinct, we will avoid the simplistic conclusion that the Course's teachings on compassion invalidate judicial systems and accountability for behavioral activities."

However, it cautions us early in the text not to deny that we do believe we are bodies: \"The body is merely part of your experience in the physical world. Its abilities can be and frequently are over evaluated. However, it is almost impossible to deny its existence in this world. Those who do so are engaging in a particularly unworthy form of denial\" (T-2.IV.3:8-11). The Course is also very clear that we are not to force ourselves to believe anything we are not ready to accept. Our belief in the body is very strong. It is an identity we have chosen in order to blot out all awareness of the mind and its power to choose, so we can convincingly perceive ourselves as victims. One of the important goals of the Course is to teach us that we do have a mind. In the Introduction to the workbook we are told: \"The purpose of the workbook is to train your mind in a systematic way to a different perception of everyone and everything in the world\" (W-in.4:1). So, while you do your bodybuilding to your heart's content, the Course reminds you gently that there's more to you than the body, and ultimately that you are not a body at all. It invites you to a \"mind building\" program, where the goal is to become aware of all the thoughts and beliefs you hold that oppose the truth of who you truly are, and ask for help to have them be transformed gradually, to whatever extent you are willing. This is the meaning of forgiveness--letting go of grievances. Just as bodybuilding takes time and practice, so does it take practice to undo the thought system of the ego with which we have identified. The Course tells us that we have managed to learn what is not true (that we are guilty, individual bodies), and that we are therefore capable of learning to recognize the truth (that we are spirit, God's one innocent Son). In this learning is salvation, which requires no strain or force."

    "text_input": "Q #427: Will you please compare and contrast the meaning of to \"make\" and to \"create\" in accordance with the teachings of A Course in Miracles.",
    "output": "As the Glossary Index for \"A Course in Miracles\" by Kenneth Wapnick states: \"spirit creates, while the ego makes\" (p. 144). What the spirit creates is true and therefore real, what the ego makes is false and therefore unreal. Whenever the Course speaks of creating, it is referring to God's power of creation, which He shares with His Son. Creating takes place only outside of time and space, on the level of the Mind. Nothing on the level of form is created. The Glossary Index states further that making can be referred to as miscreating (p. 144). The thought of separation is a miscreation that is the ego, and is responsible for making the illusion that we experience as the world of form. The ego \"makes\" this world and the body as a substitute for the truth of God's creation, which is spirit. However, nothing that is \"made\" exists in reality. It is illusory, because there is no substitute for God's creation. Depending on its choice to identify with the truth of spirit, or the lies of the ego, the mind has the power to create or to miscreate. Believing that what the mind miscreates (\"makes\") is real introduces conflict into the mind of the Son. The mind is then faced with the choice between sanity or insanity, truth or illusion, healing or sickness: \"The fundamental conflict in this world, then, is between creation and miscreation. All fear is implicit in the second, and all love in the first. The conflict is therefore one between love and fear\" (T-2.VII.3:13-15). This conflict is resolved through the process of forgiveness, whereby we learn to accept the Holy Spirit's correction of all the ego has made as a result of taking the thought of separation seriously."

    "text_input": "Q #428: From the accounts of many people who have had near-death experiences, we can conclude that the material world and our planet are very important and designed for spiritual learning, training, and evolving. There are no futile things in them and everything has meaning. On the contrary, from view of A Course in Miracles, our world is meaningless and designed by the ego to keep the illusion of separation and to control the guilt over the separation. The contradiction is obvious. I perceive the accounts of people having had NDE as evidence from the spiritual world. How can you explain the contradiction?",
    "output": "If the separation from God never happened, then in reality there is no world. \"This is the central thought the course attempts to teach\" (W-pI.132.6:3). However, since we think the world is real, then A Course in Miracles teaches us how to use the world--\"made as an attack on God\" (W-pII.3.2:1)--to learn that ultimately it is illusory, and further, that the self that thinks it exists in the world is also illusory. In that sense, the world is our classroom, until with the Holy Spirit's help we change all of the mistaken beliefs in our minds. Thus, on the level of absolute truth, the world is totally illusory; but on the level of our dream of separation, we can learn to use our interactions in the world to help us awaken from the dream, at which point the world would disappear back into the nothingness from which it came. The world is meaningful or important, thus, only to the extent that our experiences in the world can tell us whether we have chosen to reinforce the ego's purpose or Jesus' purpose. Choosing the ego as our teacher would serve to keep us rooted in the world and forever apart from the peace of God. Choosing Jesus as our teacher would serve to remind us of the absurdity of wanting to exist apart from our true home in Heaven as aliens in a world of separate beings always involved in life-and-death struggles on some level. A near-death experience can be extremely valuable in helping people realize there is something beyond bodily existence; but the same experience can occur--and has occurred many, many times--apart from a NDE. In a section in the text called \"Beyond the Body\" (T-18.VI), Jesus describes the body as a \"limit imposed on the universal communication that is an eternal property of mind\" (8:3), and then he discusses the experience of being liberated or transported beyond the body. In part Jesus explains, \"What really happens is that you have given up the illusion of a limited awareness, and lost your fear of union\" (11:7). Then at the end of the section, he invites us to \"come to this place of refuge, where you can be yourself in peace. Not through destruction, not through a breaking out, but merely by a quiet melting in. For peace will join you there simply because you have been willing to let go the limits you have placed upon love, and joined it where it is and where it led you, in answer to its gentle call to be at peace\" (14:5-7). From the perspective of A Course in Miracles, thus, NDE's can be helpful, not as evidence of a spiritual world beyond the physical world, but as evidence of another dimension in one's own mind that can be chosen any time the value of a separate, individual existence is called into question. How that is experienced (the form) varies from individual to individual. But coming close to death is not a condition for having it."

    "text_input": "Q #429: It has been stated many times that it is not the goal of A Course in Miracles to help us get what we want in the world. But doesn't it sort of do that anyway? What I mean is, if we are having problems with health or money, and through the Course we remove the guilt that underlies those projections, then don't our circumstances improve?",
    "output": "A basic principle of the Course teaches that \"Ideas leave not their source\" (W-pI.132.5:3), which is the mind. Whatever occurs in form in our experience is a reflection of a choice in the mind to identify with the ego or the Holy Spirit. Our experience in the world involves a myriad of seemingly different situations, which are neutral in themselves. It is our interpretation of them that gives them power to take away our peace, or leave it unaffected. The interpretation is based on a belief about ourselves. When the mind chooses to identify with the ego thought system, thus with separation and the body, it interprets sickness or lack of money as a threat or attack. When the mind chooses to identify with the Holy Spirit, having a sickness or lack of money is not perceived as attack, and has no effect on a person's peacefulness. Any physical condition is then irrelevant; it may or may not change. Although the power of the mind may be used to change physical conditions, unless the choice for the Holy Spirit's healing is made, the problem will continue in one form or another. It is the mind that is sick and therefore in need of healing: \"The body needs no healing. But the mind that thinks it is a body is sick indeed!\" (T-25.in.3:1-2) You are correct in saying that the goal of the Course is not to make things better in the world: \" ... seek not to change the world, but choose to change your mind about the world\" (T- 21.in.1:7). It is a mistake to believe that the source of distress is anything external to the mind, such as physical sickness or lack of money The Course tells us that the cause of all conflict is a choice in the mind to believe that the separation is real. Its goal is the healing of the mind of this thought, teaching us our true identity is mind, not the body, whether it be a healthy, sick, wealthy, or poor one. This is the important lesson we are asked to learn. Only this will bring us the peace we seek, and the ultimate awakening from the dream of separation."

    "text_input": "Q #430: In the manual for teachers of A Course in Miracles the question is asked, \"How many teachers of God are needed to save the world? The answer to this question is--one.\" Wasn't Jesus already that one teacher? If we are all one mind, then why would there need to be another \"wholly perfect teacher?\"",
    "output": "You are right, we are all one mind, and there is not another \"wholly perfect teacher.\" Jesus is the one teacher, along with all of us. The Course tells us that when the mind of a separated one accepts the Atonement, awareness of our true Identity as the one, innocent Son of God returns to the mind. With that awareness comes the recognition that separation is impossible and thus the world is \"saved.\" However, the world does not actually need to be saved; first, because \"there is no world\" (W-pI.132.6:2), and secondly, being already accomplished, salvation merely returns truth to awareness. In the healing of the mind of any \"one,\" the entire Sonship is healed. That is because the healed mind no longer identifies with the separate individual. As the manual states in the section to which you refer: \"Thus does the son of man become the Son of God\" (M-12.2:1). The acceptance of our Identity as God's innocent Son includes everyone because we all share this Sonship. Every \"son\" becomes the same \"Son,\" who is the one teacher. This must be so since salvation is the healing of the thought of separation, it is not complete as long as anyone is held apart as somehow separate. That is why whenever the Course refers to healing or salvation, it reminds us that we are not healed or saved alone. In one of the most clear and inclusive statements of this, Jesus says: \"And as you let yourself be healed, you see all those around you, or who cross your mind, or whom you touch or those who seem to have no contact with you, healed along with you. Perhaps you will not recognize them all, nor realize how great your offering to all the world, when you let healing come to you. But you are never healed alone. And legions upon legions will receive the gift that you receive when you are healed\" (W-pI.137.10)."

    "text_input": "Q #431: I have been studying and trying to practice A Course in Miracles for 13 years and have had moments of peace. Lately, I have noticed that I have a dialogue that goes on inside. For example, I will be in a situation where I suddenly find myself getting ticked off, and before I react, I consciously stop and go into a dialogue of what the Course would say, like \"anger is never justified in any form\" or \"I must have chosen wrongly.\" That gives me a pause to \"think\" what to choose. The anger may remain for a while, but I am probably giving it a lot of energy, and then after a while it goes away and I'm more peaceful. That constant dialogue is \"hard\" on me even though I have had successes. I just don't know what's going on.",
    "output": "From your description, it sounds as if you are simply doing what is asked of you in the Course. This is a Course in mind-training after all, a Course in thought-reversal. And so there will be changes in your way of reacting to situations. That is positive. The re-training of you mind involves becoming aware of which teacher you have chosen to follow and that your reactions directly follow that choice of teachers. Becoming aware of a Course principle or phrase does not necessarily mean you will choose it. But, on the other hand, the fact that you ask yourself what the Course would say indicates that at that instant you are not totally identified with your ego. That is progress, and as you continue to do that more and more, it will become more natural to you. This is a gradual process of letting go of one way of thinking and reacting, and replacing it with another. That can throw off your equilibrium for a while, which is why you never want to force anything. Just be patient and gentle, and remind yourself that you are undoing something that never happened in the first place. You are in the process of replacing your wrong-minded self with your right-minded self, a self that will be less angry, judgmental, and arrogant, and more compassionate, calm, and humble. As the lessons say again and again, asking the help of Jesus or the Holy Spirit in the continual monitoring of your mind, and observing--not changing--your ego thoughts in action is your only responsibility. \"And What you are will tell you of itself\" (T- 31.V.17:9). As you progress in this, you can then take the next step of questioning why you get angry in the first place. As you know, anger is a defense. We become angry over what someone else has done as a way of keeping our attention focused outside ourselves. Our real problem is the guilt and self-hatred from our self-accusation of having destroyed love in order to gain our own existence in our own world apart from Heaven. To avoid dealing with that, we project the guilt and self- hatred and then see it in others, feeling perfectly justified in our anger. \"Learn this, and learn it well,\" Jesus says, \"for it is here delay of happiness is shortened by a span of time you cannot realize. You never hate your brother for his sins, but only for your own. Whatever form his sins appear to take, it but obscures the fact that you believe them to be yours, and therefore meriting a 'just' attack\" (T-31.III.1:4-6). So until you begin to ask for help to deal with the real cause of the anger, the pattern of it coming and going will not change. When the guilt in your mind is gone, only peace will remain; and then nothing anyone else says or does would affect this peace."

    "text_input": "Q #432: In the 1960s there were experiments with LSD and other psychedelics in treating autism, schizophrenia, and other mental disorders. The results of the experiments were fascinating, and helpful in improving mental health through the metaphysical experiences some patients had. This is how transpersonal psychology emerged. So would the using of psychedelics be helpful in removing the ego and in spiritual evolving? What would be the view of A Course in Miracles on this subject?",
    "output": "The Course distinguishes between the brain, which is a physical organ, and the mind, which is outside time and space. A further important distinction is that the body, of which the brain is a part, is not autonomous, despite our experience. The body is a projection (an effect) of a thought in the trans-temporal/spatial mind (the cause), and therefore is but an expression of the choices made in the mind to support either the ego's thought system or the Holy Spirit's. Adapting a passage from the text, we can say that the body thus \"is the witness to your state of mind, the outside picture of an inward condition\" (T-21.in.1:5). When the body appears to be sick (physically or psychologically), what has happened is that the mind has followed the ego's guidance, and healing therefore can occur only when the mind recognizes that this was a mistake and then chooses against the ego and for the Holy Spirit or Jesus instead. In view of these Course principles, psychedelics, since they affect only the brain, really would not be a means of removing the ego or furthering one's spiritual progress. All healing--which is not simply the disappearance of symptoms--according to A Course in Miracles is the result of a shift in perception in one's mind: \"the recognition that sickness is of the mind, and has nothing to do with the body\" (M-5.II.3:1). This would be true of autism, schizophrenia, or any other mental disorder, as well as all physical conditions. This points out the importance of the Course's teachings on cause and effect--the mind is always the cause, and the body is never anything other than an effect. If the cause changes, the effect will change accordingly. If, therefore, an observable change follows the administering of drugs, it could only mean that the mind chose differently, as Jesus explains in the same section of the manual just quoted: \"Special agents seem to be ministering to him, yet they but give form to his own choice. He chooses them in order to bring tangible form to his desires. And it is this they do, and nothing else. They are not actually needed at all. The patient could merely rise up without their aid and say, 'I have no use for this.' There is no form of sickness that would not be cured at once\" (M- 5.II.2:8-13). This view is not meant to diminish the importance and value of the field of transpersonal psychology. Clearly many, many people over the years have found it to be an effective approach to both understanding human dynamics and treating a variety of conditions. A Course in Miracles has a different set of premises and a different orientation. Whatever path leads one to be more kind and less guilty is the path one should follow."

    "text_input": "Q #433: In your book The Most Commonly Asked Questions About A Course in Miracles, you stated that Course students would be falling into the trap of specialness if they insisted that their partners be \"spiritually like minded or more specifically students of the Course.\" Now, I understand that. How wonderful it be, though, to have a romantic partner who was also going through the same process, someone with whom I could share things like the Course and forgiveness. This path of self-discovery is so exciting and I am learning so much that I find it  impossible to date people who I consider small-minded and petty and have no conception of a spirituality. What do you think?",
    "output": "There might appear to be an advantage in having an intimate partner with whom you could share and discuss your spiritual process, but that really assumes that you know what is best for you. It could be that for you the most effective means of staying with the content of being a student of the Course, is to be associated most of the time with people who are not students of the Course, or not even interested in spirituality. There is no way of knowing, because we have no idea of the part any relationship plays in our Atonement path. In a larger context, Jesus states that we cannot really judge anything at all. The aim of the Course's curriculum \"is the recognition that judgment in the usual sense is impossible. This is not an opinion but a fact. In order to judge anything rightly, one would have to be fully aware of an inconceivably wide range of things; past, present and to come. One would have to recognize in advance all the effects of his judgments on everyone and everything involved in them in any way. And one would have to be certain there is no distortion in his perception ... Who is in a position to do this?\" (M-10.3:1-6). The content in being a student of this Course has largely to do with our shifting from the ego's judgment of differences to Jesus' perception that the differences among us are unimportant relative to our equality as anguished minds reaching out for healing and for help in finding our way back to the home we believe we left. That lesson can be learned with or without an intimate partner, with or without a partner devoted to spirituality. Similarly, learning not to take another person's attack personally can be done in any circumstances, on any level of relationships. Your feelings about the desirability of a \"Course partner\" are understandable, but at the same time, in a way you are defining the terms and conditions of what a relationship for you should be. You are basically putting yourself in charge, saying that you cannot be happy unless ... And the problem with the criterion you are giving is that it is exclusive. That is always a red flag, a path with many consequences you want to consider carefully before committing to. It isn't easy to let go of the tendency to think that we know what is in our own best interests, and then \"step back and let Him lead the way\" (W-pI.155). But given our track record, that probably is a wise thing to do."

However, occasionally, with a vengeance, I slip back into wrong-mindedness and my behavior seems to set the seeds for a very difficult return; i.e., a major argument. Is this disturbing \"shift\" part of the process? Have you any advice or passages to aid in a speedy \"shift\" back?",
    "output": "Yes, frequent trips to the wrong mind are part of the process. In a nutshell, the only way to the right mind is to accept responsibility for the choice to be separate, and to choose not to be separate. This usually involves a long, hard look at a deep desire to continue to identify with the body, and to see ourselves as separate, different, and generally better than everybody else. The best place to start is not to judge yourself for choosing the wrong mind, and then be glad that you realize you have done so and are not in denial. This means you can effectively apply what A Course in Miracles asks us to do: \"Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all of the barriers within yourself that you have built against it. It is not necessary to seek for what is true, but it is necessary to seek for what is false. Every illusion is one of fear, whatever form it takes\" (T-16.IV.6:1-3). Since the wrong mind is the problem, and the belief in the separation is what needs healing, being aware of the specific form it takes in our individual lives is a very important part of the process. It provides us with the opportunity to expose the thoughts and beliefs hidden in our minds so they can be corrected by the Holy Spirit. An ego attack can be a very helpful exposure of hidden beliefs, so they can be looked at. The most effective thing you can do when you find yourself in your wrong mind is to take a good look: \"You cannot lay aside the obstacles to real vision without looking upon them, for to lay aside means to judge against. If you will look, the Holy Spirit will judge, and He will judge truly. Yet He cannot shine away what you keep hidden, for you have not offered it to Him and He cannot take it from you\" (T-12.II.9:6-8)."

Search your mind for any judgments or grievances you are holding onto, and then bring them to the forgiving love of Jesus in your mind, where you will let them go when you no longer want to pay the cost of holding onto them. There is not much else you can do when you suspect you may have done something wrong but don't know what it is, and no one is willing to answer your questions. If you can let go of any investment you have in fixing the situation or doing something to win back the other people's friendship, then you can simply trust that you will have many other opportunities to correct any mistakes you may have made.

    "text_input": "Q #436: A Course in Miracles says to laugh away the ego, as it never was or will be real. But I find that I have to really work hard on my \"lower emotions\" to be able to get rid of them. Work hard, means: cry, write about them, tell them to another person, have temper tantrums with myself, or any other form of expressing them. Otherwise I feel that it is very easy to negate or repress them and keep on acting as if nothing had happened, but keep running around full of resentments. After doing all this, then I can look at my projection and forgive my brother, and then ask for help in forgiving myself. Am I making the error real? Why does Jesus not say anything about this process?",
    "output": "First, and most importantly, you can \"laugh away the ego\" only when you experience it as unreal. If you try to get rid of something, you must be perceiving it as real; and the Course never asks us to get rid of what we think is real. That would be sacrifice, and Jesus reminds us often that sacrifice is not loving. The only way your feelings or emotions can change is by getting in touch with the cause of them, and then deciding whether you wish to uphold that anymore. You cannot simply will yourself to be kind instead of hateful, for example, or will yourself into not having bodily needs. The Course's approach is a gentle one, which means it is far more helpful to forgive yourself for your lapses and resistance, than to force yourself to give up what you still are heavily invested in. That is why so much of the focus of Jesus' teachings is on purpose. It is just about impossible for us to let go of our identity with the body and all of its needs and impulses. We simply cannot do that, because they are defenses protecting us from an overwhelming terror in our minds. But what is well within the range of possibility is to learn the difference between the ego's purpose for the world and the body and Jesus' purpose--and then to choose one. That is much more in keeping with the overall message of the Course, which is that the world and the body are not the problem; the choices we make in our minds are the problem. So rather than forcing yourself to get rid of emotions, which are not the problem, you might try shifting your focus to the purpose for which you use your body: to reinforce differences and separation, or to help you learn that your interests are the same as everyone else's."

    "text_input": "Q #437: There is one aspect of being a student of A Course in Miracles that just keeps nagging me. In answering #235 you stated that neither God nor Jesus intervenes in the world to fix problems. Does this mean that we are just on our own within the dream and have no one we can turn to for help? I understand the ultimate goal of the Course is to undo the dream, but while we are working toward that goal we are \"stuck\" within the dream and have things we have to accomplish just to be able to continue working with the Course. Is there really no help from within to assist us in doing what we need to do within the dream? A child may believe there is a monster under his bed, and he is terrified. An adult knows there is nothing under the bed, but he doesn't just dismiss what the child believes and leave him comfortless. The adult does everything it can to make the child feel safe. I just find it difficult to believe that if I need something within the dream, even though to Jesus it may be just as unreal as the monster under that child's bed, that I can't get any help from him to accomplish what I need to do just to be able to continue within the dream.",
    "output": "Helen Schucman's experience was that Jesus helped her with very specific things in her life, even with things that were not essential to her being able to \"continue within the dream,\" as you expressed it. There is nothing wrong in asking Jesus or the Holy Spirit for help with specifics, as Jesus explains in the \"Ladder of Prayer\" section in The Song of Prayer. There he helps us understand what \"asking-out-of-need\" is all about. In fact, he says that \"no one who is uncertain of his Identity can avoid praying in this way\" (S-1.II.2:3). He just does not want us to stay at that level of relationship with either ourselves or him, because there is so much more that awaits us. He wants us to value his love above any specific form in which it may be reflected. In asking for help and comfort within the dream, you will not get stuck as long as you remember, among other things, that \"the world was made that problems could not be escaped\" (T-31.IV.2:6). Our egos are sly and always seeking ways to join us in our study of the Course. And this would be one of its favorite ways: in the guise of prayer to reinforce our identity as real individuals with real needs in a real world, rekindling hope that we will yet be happy here. What will help you avoid this trap is to keep in mind that we are always dealing with symbols, symbols for dynamics in our minds that are outside time and space entirely. This is brought to light in Chapter 17 of Kenneth's book, Absence from Felicity. Having said this, though, it is still true that Jesus and the Holy Spirit are not active in the world. That is the importance of understanding the metaphysics of the Course, particularly the symbolic nature of everything we experience within the illusion of separation, as is made clear in the chapter in Kenneth's book just referred to. Our experience of Jesus, as well as of ourselves, will change as we identify less and less with the body, and as we take the differences we perceive among us less and less seriously. Jesus' love will be associated less and less with answers to prayers for specifics, and more and more with the \"song\": \"Therefore, it is not the form of the question that matters, nor how it is asked. The form of the answer, if given by God, will suit your need as you see it. This is merely an echo of the reply of His Voice [the Holy Spirit]. The real sound is always a song of thanksgiving and of Love ... In true prayer you hear only the song. All the rest is merely added. You have sought first the Kingdom of Heaven, and all else has indeed been given you\" (S-1.I.2:6-9; 3:4-6). Finally, sometimes it helps to remember his reassuring words and simply trust that we will get through what seems like a very trying existence in this world: \"You do not walk alone. God's angels hover near and all about. His Love surrounds you, and of this be sure; that I will never leave you comfortless\" (W-pII.ep.6:6-8)."

    "text_input": "Q #438: I have been wondering about a passage in A Course in Miracles that says that a conflict arises because a voice demands we obey. If we do obey, rage will follow because we will feel coerced, and if we don't, that part of the mind will be outraged. Either way, rage will result. The Course says that this state is caused by a lack of love. My question regards my own experience. I have usually disobeyed that voice because of its cruel demanding way. I feel intense guilt because this voice reminds me that I hurt someone because I didn't follow its instructions. So how should I feel about this voice that tells me I am wrong or I don't deserve what I have because I didn't follow its decree? I really need to know if I need to do anything to right the wrong because I really desperately want to get rid of all this and replace it with forgiveness.",
    "output": "The only voice that would cruelly demand obedience, or judge you in any way belongs to the ego. It is a voice that will always reflect the painful effects of having chosen to believe that the separation is real, that such a belief is a sin, guilt is justified, and punishment is inevitable. There is no resolution to this through retribution, or behavior of any kind. For a student of the Course, the only way out of its circuitous system of judgment and condemnation is to apply its principles as carefully and consistently as possible. There is no need to \"do\" anything else. That is how to listen to the Voice of the Holy Spirit in a practical way, and only this will lead to freedom from guilt. The passage you refer to, T-2.VI.5, is speaking about the conflict in the wrong mind. It is not contrasting the wrong mind with the right mind. It describes the insanity that follows a choice to identify with the ego thought system, and then to attempt to assuage the inevitable fear by controlling behavior, without making another choice in the mind. It is one of the ways the ego tries to have its cake and eat it, too: keep the thought of separation real, but get rid of the guilt and fear that go with it. The passage says that \"conflict is an expression of fear\" (T-2.VI.7:1, italics ours); in other words, conflict is telling us that we have become afraid. In the same paragraph the Course goes on to say: \"Fear arises from lack of love\" (T-2.VI.7:6). Thus, fear is the result of the choice to be separate from love. Conflicted behavior and rage are the outcome when we choose separation, and then try to behave in a way that seems loving, convinced that in this way we will appease a punishing god. The bottom line in all of this is that it doesn't work. The only thing that does work is to be honest about what we want. The process the Course leads us through can be effective only if learn to recognize all the ways our thoughts, beliefs, and acts show us the choice we have made in the mind to be separate, and then recognize the heavy price we pay (all the pain, anguish, and conflict experienced in our individual lives, and in the world). Jesus invites us to ask ourselves if we really want to pay this price for our individual, separate, and meaningless existence in the world. The process takes practice because we are so strongly attached to belief in our identity as bodies. The Course is clear and uncompromising, but coercion of any kind is completely inconsistent with the gentleness and love of Jesus' message. When the Course speaks of \"obeying\" the laws of the mind, it is not referring to a choice to be obedient or not, especially not forced obedience. It means that because \"ideas leave not their source\" (T-27.VII.13), a choice in the mind will have certain inevitable effects. In other words, the effect \"obeys\" the cause. The choice for separation always produces guilt and fear. It reinforces the ego thought system and belief in the identity of the body. The choice for the Holy Spirit's correction (not coercion) results in peace, and allows the extension of love, which reinforces the truth of who we are. Eventually this will be all we truly want."

    "text_input": "Q #439: I have rediscovered Christianity, which I had abandoned before finding A Course in Miracles 14 years ago. When I read your discussion on Christianity, I wondered why you consider anything the Bible has to say as irrelevant to the Course. (Perhaps that's paraphrasing too much.) My understanding of the meaning behind Jesus' teachings have now become much clearer since studying the Course, which brings more meaning to Christianity, not less. Should I regard all Christian teaching as mistaken thereby \"throwing the baby out with the bathwater\"?",
    "output": "You should do whatever you are comfortable with, whatever helps you feel loved and forgiven. If the Bible and Christianity help you achieve that, it would be foolish not to follow that path. However, the theologies and practices of traditional Christianity and other biblically- based religions do not revolve around the purpose of Jesus' life as you see it. Christianity teaches explicitly that God created the world; sin and death are real; Jesus was the only-begotten Son of God; his sacrificial death was his Father's Will; and through his sacrifice, we all are saved. If you interpret the Bible as saying something else, that's fine; but it would not be the traditional Christian interpretation. From the perspective of A Course in Miracles these are all mistaken beliefs, the correction of which is one of the major purposes of the Course. That is why we say the two thought systems are mutually exclusive. You would not be doing justice to either one by trying to combine them. But, again, if you are guided to follow biblical teachings, that is what you should do. The Course itself says that there are thousands of forms of the universal course (M-1.4:1-2). If you have not already done so, you might have a look at our book, A Course in Miracles and Christianity: A Dialogue, coauthored by Kenneth Wapnick and W. Norris Clarke, S.J., a Catholic priest. The decisive differences between Christianity and A Course in Miracles are clearly identified and discussed in the loving spirit of friends who respect their differences, and agree to disagree."

    "text_input": "Q #440: For years now I study and do my utmost to practice the principles of A Course in Miracles. But how on earth do I forgive a person like Saddam Hussein? Have I not forgiven myself in total that I seem not to be able to forgive leaders like him? They always seem to be people I do not know personally, but who are capable of allowing in their governments the most horrible things to happen to their fellow men. It comes down to the question: How do I forgive totally and completely?",
    "output": "When the mind chooses to believe that the separation is real it gives rise to intolerable guilt that must be projected out. It is first projected onto a made-up god of vengeance (victimizer), who will punish the Son (victim) for the imagined separation thought. This ego dynamic of an \"innocent\" victim pursued by an angry, vicious victimizer runs through every authority relationship in the world, in many different forms. In the following passage this dynamic is described: \"Suffering is an emphasis upon all that the world has done to injure you. Here is the world's demented version of salvation clearly shown. Like to a dream of punishment, in which the dreamer is unconscious of what brought on the attack against himself, he sees himself attacked unjustly and by something not himself. He is the victim of this 'something else,' a thing outside himself, for which he has no reason to be held responsible. He must be innocent because he knows not what he does, but what is done to him. Yet is his own attack upon himself apparent still, for it is he who bears the suffering. And he cannot escape because its source is seen outside himself\" (T-27.VII.1). Several important principles of the Course's teaching of forgiveness are presented here, and are meant to be applied precisely to the situations you describe. The Course tells us that the source of all victimization is in the mind that has attacked itself by believing that it can be separate from its Source (God). The choice to believe this thought of separation and the ensuing guilt are forgotten, and then appear in some form of conflict in the world, with the victimization theme running through it. There is no resolution in the world. There is obviously an endless supply of Hitlers, Husseins, or other less dramatic examples of victimizers. This is because, as the Course tells us, the problem is in the mind and not in the world. The first step in the forgiveness process then, is recognizing that guilt in the mind is the cause of all conflict, pain, and victimization experienced in the world. This is a very difficult step because the situations in the world are so convincing. On the ego's terms projection works; it keeps the suffering of the world in operation. This guilt lies buried in all of us, and thus is unnoticed and unhealed. When a particular form of \"evil-doer\" comes along and we judge him or her, we are provided with another opportunity to forgive this unconscious guilt. Incidentally, this does not mean that you approve of the cruelty of others, but it does mean that you do not have to condemn the person. If you could forgive totally and completely you would not need A Course in Miracles to lead you through the gentle steps of letting the Holy Spirit transform all the beliefs of the ego thought system. It is enough to be willing to question your interpretation of the situations you describe, by remembering the true source of the conflict and asking for a new interpretation: \"The Guest Whom God sent you will teach you how to do this, if you but recognize the little spark and are willing to let it grow. Your willingness need not be perfect, because His is\" (T-11.II.6:5-6)."

    "text_input": "Q #442: God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit are characters of the holy Bible with definite roles in relationship to the human race. (i) So, why does A Course in Miracles use these same characters instead of original ones or generic ones like \"higher-self\"? (ii) And, can you define, \"God, Jesus & Holy Spirit\" according to ACIM?",
    "output": "A (i): While the basic message of the Course is universal, its form is not, nor is it meant to be. Its curriculum is clearly intended for a special audience: the Western world that has grown up under the powerful influence of Christianity, an influence that has not been very Christian nor spiritual, one could argue. That is why its conceptual-linguistic framework is that of the Western world and Christianity in particular, and also why one its major purposes is to correct what in its view are the mistakes of traditional Christianity. It uses concepts and language common to biblical religions to lead its students to an experience that transcends the limits of all conceptual thought. And in its continual emphasis on the content, rather than the form of its message, it avoids the inevitable conflict of institutions overly bound to ritual and form. From the Introduction to Forgiveness and Jesus: The Meeting Place of Christianity and A Course in Miracles (pp. 9-11): \" ... Jesus' identity as the source of the material so explicitly manifest ... has posed problems for many of the Course's students and would-be students. This group has included not only Jews who grew up midst Christian anti-Semitism, but large numbers of Christians for whom Jesus has become a strong, anti-religious symbol. The answer to this question [the reason for the Christian framework] is found in the modus operandi of the Holy Spirit, Who corrects our errors in the forms in which they appear, for forgiveness can only heal in the form in which the unforgiveness was expressed. By joining us in the world of our mistakes, the Holy Spirit gently corrects our illusions and leads us beyond them to the truth. [Christianity] preserved for centuries the memory and example of Jesus--the purest expression we have known of the Love of God--including his gospel of forgiveness, as well as benefiting mankind with its many cultural HYPERLINK \"http://facimoutreach.org/qa/questions/questions25.htm#Q120\"  HYPERLINK \"http://facimoutreach.org/qa/questions/questions25.htm#Q120\"and ethical contributions. On the other hand, Christianity as been a religion of sacrifice, guilt, persecution, murder, and elitism, with Jesus its primary symbol--he whose gospel was only love, forgiveness, peace, and unity. As the Course states: 'Some bitter idols have been made of him who would be only brother to the world' (C-5.5:7). The development of Christianity can be seen in part as the history of a people who, though believing in Jesus and his message, often unwittingly brought tragedy instead of comfort and salvation to the world. Instead of uniting all people under God as one family, it has divided and sub-divided this family. Before we can fully accept Jesus' radical message of forgiveness ... the errors of the past must be undone. Within this context, it can be said that one of the goals of A Course in Miracles is to correct these mistakes of separation that entered into traditional Christian teachings, distorting Jesus' central message of God's love for all people, and our need to forgive each other as the means of restoring this love to our awareness. Before we can transcend the separatisms of religion and know our oneness in God, the religions of the world must be purified of their errors. A Course in Miracles has been given to the world as one means of such purification.\" Another source you may wish to consult for an explanation of the Course's view of Jesus and the New Testament accounts of the meaning of his life may be found in the Afterword to Kenneth's Christian Psychology and A Course in Miracles, second edition. : From our Glossary-Index for A Course in Miracles: GOD: the First Person in the Trinity; the Creator, the Source of all being or life; the Father, Whose Fatherhood is established by the existence of His Son, Christ; the First Cause, Whose Son is His Effect; God's essence is spirit, which is shared with all creation, whose unity is the state of Heaven. HOLY SPIRIT: the Third Person of the Trinity Who is metaphorically described in the Course as God's Answer to the separation; the Communication Link between God and His separated Sons, bridging the gap between the Mind of Christ and our split mind; the memory of God and His Son we took with us into our dream; the One Who sees our illusions (perception), leading us through them to the truth (knowledge); the Voice for God Who speaks for Him and for our real Self, reminding us of the Identity we forgot; also referred to as Bridge, Comforter, Guide, Mediator, Teacher, and Translator. JESUS: the source of A Course in Miracles, its first person or \"I\"; the one who first completed his part in the Atonement, enabling him to be in charge of the whole plan; transcending his ego, Jesus has become identified with Christ and can now serve as our model for learning and an ever--present help when we call upon him in our desire to forgive. Note: not to be exclusively identified with Christ, the Second Person of the Trinity."

    "text_input": "Q #443: Nothing in A Course in Miracles says we can't have preferences. This is consistent with the concept of forgiveness, because accepting a preference is clearly a way of temporarily accepting and forgiving the perception of degrees of illusion. Therefore, if I like french-fries but hate carrots, I should not be concerned about it because that would just validate the illusion. I understand that--for now--I've dreamed up a body, which needs food, and prefers certain types of food. It is all just orders of magnitude of illusion, so just forgive it, right? Obviously, to feel guilt about my \"tastes\" simply feeds the cycle of guilt/projection/attack.  What if I like white people but hate people of other color? Or vice-versa? Would Course theology not advocate forgiving ourselves this kind of perception of differences also? We cannot say this is \"more important.\" No illusion is \"more important.\" We cannot say that people are our \"brothers\" and french-fries are not: they are all just forms in a world of forms. Granted I should not project hate and guilt onto people of any color. But I should not project hate and guilt onto vegetables of any color either. Both call for forgiveness, neither is \"greater\" or \"more important\" ... Is it?",
    "output": "Yes, you are quite right. There is no difference between a carrot and a human being, except in the meaning we have given each. Think back to the earliest workbook lessons and how we are asked to apply the idea for the day indiscriminately to everything in our field of vision or in our mind, not excluding anything (W-pI.1-4). You even might say, when it comes to vegetables, we are kinder to the ones we hate, because we're much less likely to eat them than the ones we like. But, of course, it's the people we \"love\" whom we cannibalize as well, so we can feel better about ourselves and fill the emotional hole in the center of our being, at least temporarily--much as food satisfies our hunger only for a short time before we need to go seeking for more. It is hard not to allow the \"accepted moral judgments\" of the ego to creep into our understanding of the Course's teachings. The Course in fact does not say that we should not hate our brothers, be they homo sapiens or carrots. Rather, its goal is to help us uncover our guilt, wherever it may be projected, so that it can be undone. So we don't want to try to stop hating certain people or overlook our strong feelings of dislike towards certain vegetables, but rather to be honest with ourselves about our hatreds so we can ask for help in seeing, not only the other but ourselves differently, since we are observing only our own self-hatred projected outward. I apparently can lose my peace of mind as easily over a carrot as I can over a person I don't like whom I see as different from me. And yet it is not the other that has upset me--\"I am never upset for the reason I think\" (W-pI.5)--they simply become the scapegoat to blame for the consequences of the decision I have made within my own mind to see myself as separate from love, convince myself I really have pulled that off, pile the guilt on, and then look to find someone or something else to blame for my unhappy state of mind. A carrot or a different- colored person can serve that purpose equally well. The distinction you make at the beginning of your question is a helpful one. We all have preferences and that is simply part of the experience of living as a body in the world. But if the preferences become emotionally invested, that simply means we have given greater meaning to those particular symbols in our experience, so that they seem now to be the cause of our dissatisfaction. But with the Holy Spirit's assistance, they can become instead the mirrors that direct us back within our own minds to the real source of dissatisfaction, our choice for the very empty and unfulfilling ego thought system. And it is that choice we want to forgive ourselves for, with the help of Jesus or the Holy Spirit."

    "text_input": "Q #444: I have questions about the nature of guilt. A Course in Miracles uses many psychological terms, including \"guilt.\" But in psychoanalysis as I understand it, guilt is something secondary to fear and based on the energy of fear. When used in the Course, this term has a very different meaning. Ontological guilt in the Course is the source and cradle of all aggression and fear. Aggression is based on the will to destroy. Fear is based on the will to escape or to hide. But what is this \"guilt\" based on? Why does separation cause \"guilt\"? Has the ontological \"guilt\" of the Course anything to do with psychological guilt? Would it be more precisely called \"inferiority feeling\" instead, since, in exploring free will, the Son would have to see himself as inferior to God once he sees himself as separate from God and cut off from perfection?",
    "output": "You want to keep in mind first of all that any linear description of the process and dynamics of separation and the accompanying feelings of guilt and fear, etc., should only be viewed heuristically, that is, as a means to understand better the process of forgiveness, or the undoing of the ego. For everything of the ego happened simultaneously and not in sequence--since time is not real--and, in reality, the thought of separation never happened at all. The only value in any discussion of this kind is whether it serves the purpose of helping us learn to forgive. Yes, the Course offers a different ontogenesis for the ego's guilt and fear from traditional psychoanalysis. For Freud was not speaking of mind as the Course uses the word, as an abstract function operating outside of time and space. His system is postulated on life as an organic process in which the body with its brain and its relationships are real, regardless of the fantasies and delusions that may underlie the dynamics of the psyche as it develops through infancy and childhood. In contrast, all psychological guilt, according to the Course, is a pale projected shadow of the underlying guilt over separation in the mind. And in fact, psychological guilt is meant to keep attention focused on externals--one's own body and others' bodies--so that we never look to the guilt within the mind that we have made up to protect the made-up thought of separation. From the Course's perspective, the thought of separation is not the problem, but the fact that we have taken it seriously (T-27.VIII.6:2-3). In alliance with the ego, this was a purposive but now unconscious decision. From the ego's perspective, to make separation real and serious in our mind, it must be equated with attack, and hence guilt, which in turn leads to fear. The following passages describe the ego's thinking that brought this about. From the text: \"If the ego is the symbol of the separation, it is also the symbol of guilt. Guilt is more than merely not of God. It is the symbol of attack on God. This is a totally meaningless concept except to the ego, but do not underestimate the power of the ego's belief in it. This is the belief from which all guilt really stems. The ego is the part of the mind that believes in division. How could part of God detach itself without believing it is attacking Him? We spoke before of the authority problem as based on the concept of usurping God's power. The ego believes that this is what you did because it believes that it is you. If you identify with the ego, you must perceive yourself as guilty. Whenever you respond to your ego you will experience guilt, and you will fear punishment. The ego is quite literally a fearful thought. However ridiculous the idea of attacking God may be to the sane mind, never forget that the ego is not sane. It represents a delusional system, and speaks for it. Listening to the ego's voice means that you believe it is possible to attack God, and that a part of Him has been torn away by you. Fear of retaliation from without follows, because the severity of the guilt is so acute that it must be projected\" (T-5.V.2:8-12; 3). And later, in the workbook: \"When parts are wrested from the whole and seen as separate and wholes within themselves, they become symbols standing for attack upon the whole; successful in effect, and never to be seen as whole again. And yet you have forgotten that they stand but for your own decision of what should be real, to take the place of what is real\" (W-pI.136.6:3-4). The thought of separation and the accompanying guilt may be experienced in many different ways, including the feeling of inferiority you mention. For separation is always based on a belief in differences--how could any separation be perceived otherwise? Whether we assert our superiority or our inferiority to God, the key is that we are different. While the Course uses the word inferiority only once (T-4.I.7:3), it does describe the feelings of inadequacy that are inherent in the ego's thought of separation (e.g., T-9.VII.45; W-pI.47.5; M-7.5). But no matter what form the guilt may appear to take in our mind, our release from it will be brought about by the recognition that it is not real, a recognition that we can never come to on our own. And so that is why the Course offers us help in the form of Jesus or the Holy Spirit, Who represent the recognition of our guiltlessness, that is, of our unity as God's Son, completely at one with His Father. And this recognition is the basis for all forgiveness. Free will, by the way, is part of the ego's delusional thought system and part of its cherished array of \"gifts.\" There is no free will in Heaven, for free will implies choice, and choice implies alternatives that can be differentiated among, an impossibility within the Oneness of spirit that Jesus reminds us is our reality."

Is feeling guilty nothing bu HYPERLINK \"http://facimoutreach.org/qa/questions/questions40.htm#Q202\"t an attempt to make someone else feel angry? Are guilt and anger therefore the same thing?",
    "output": "Cute logic. In some cases, feeling guilty may indeed have an intended effect of making another angry. This is because seeing another's guilt can be a reminder of one's own guilt, an unsettling recognition. And the only ego-based solution for dealing with one's own guilt is to project it, with anger a common form that projection takes. At other times though, feeling guilty and expressing it may be a manipulation to try to make another stop feeling angry. Consider how criminals who admit their guilt and express remorse may receive more lenient sentences. If you admit your guilt, and we are different, as the ego insists, then I must be innocent, something each of us is eager to prove at the other's expense when we play the ego's guilt-swapping game. But in the end, yes, guilt and anger are the same in that they both express the same underlying content, that is, they are merely different expressions of the underlying belief in separation and sin. Guilt is the experience of sinfulness and anger is the projection of that guilt, in an attempt to avoid responsibility for the sin and see it in someone else. \"Anger but screeches, 'Guilt is real!'\" (M-18:3.1). And because they are both manifestations of the same illusory thought, they can both be easily dismissed with the recognition that we experience them by our own choice and for no external reason. Anger dissipates as I recognize it as nothing more than a defense against and a reminder of my own guilt, and my guilt, in turn, when looked at with Jesus' love beside me, merely disappears like a wisp of fog in the morning sun."

    "text_input": "Q #446: The text of A Course in Miracles talks about two worlds. Our ability to see the real world is dependent on having real vision and also dependent on what we cherish. Seeing one world is possible because we deny the other. This I understand. But then it goes on to say that ... \"Both are not true, yet either one will seem as real to you as the amount to which you hold it dear.\" Is not the real world true? Would you kindly explain this to me.",
    "output": "Ah yes, words. They can be so confusing and confounding. There are actually two levels of answer to your question. In the context of this particular passage, when Jesus says, \"Both are not true,\" implied but not expressed is the additional thought that only one of them is true. Yet even the false world of the ego will seem true to us based on our desire for it. This distinction is similar to the one Jesus makes elsewhere in the Course between true and false perception (e.g., C-4:3). The real world is the effect of completely healed perception so that the mind is never again taken in by the ego's deceptions. The real world is not a place or a world with its own independent existence. It is merely the correction for the ego's misperception of separation and attack, replacing it with the unified perception of the Holy Spirit, which recognizes that differences are meaningless. Having said that, let's consider the other level of answer to your question. From the perspective of knowledge or Heaven, all perception--both true and false--is temporary (C-4.3:2-4; 7:1-2), and so illusory. Therefore, the real world--the outcome of true perception--must be temporary and illusory as well. Its only purpose is to undo what is not real. And so, by its very nature, it must--while reflecting non-duality--come within an illusory dualistic framework. Its purpose of healing once fulfilled, no need remains for it to continue. Towards the end of the text, a beautiful section, called \"The Borderland,\" describes the real world, its function, and its transitory nature. Two paragraphs in particular are relevant to our discussion: There is a borderland of thought that stands between this world and Heaven. It is not a place, and when you reach it is apart from time. Here is the meeting place where thoughts are brought together; where conflicting values meet and all illusions are laid down beside the truth, where they are judged to be untrue. This borderland is just beyond the gate of Heaven. Here is every thought made pure and wholly simple. Here is sin denied, and everything that is received instead. This is the journey's end. We have referred to it as the real world. And yet there is a contradiction here, in that the words imply a limited reality, a partial truth, a segment of the universe made true. This is because knowledge makes no attack upon perception. They are brought together, and only one continues past the gate where oneness is. Salvation is a borderland where place and time and choice have meaning still, and yet it can be seen that they are temporary, out of place, and every choice has been already made (T-26.III.2-3)."

I have learned how to look upon the world, but worries of the world still trouble me constantly. For me, worries about money--how I am going to pay the bills seem to be my only setback. Where in the Course should I look to bring myself to peace with this problem? I have called upon the Holy Spirit for some answers, but am impatiently awaiting his response! Perhaps an inappropriate need of advice rather than a true question about the Course, but would appreciate a response all the same.",
    "output": "If you have \"learned how to look upon the world,\" you know then, at least intellectually, that it is \"the outside picture of an inward condition\" (T-21.in.1:4). Jesus therefore wants us to use our experiences and reactions to the world as a way of learning what we are thinking in our minds. If you are worried about something in the world, then there is a desire within your mind to have the world be real and to be the cause of your lack of peace. There is a thought in your mind that says, \"I don't want to go back home and be with God; I want to be an individual on my own, but I don't want to be held responsible for this decision to separate from God.\" Worries about situations in the world serve that purpose nicely, which is why Lesson 5 states, \"I am never upset for the reason I think\" (W-pI.5). Rather than look in our minds at the sin and our guilt over destroying love so we could have our own existence, we deny it because the ego has us terrified that we will be destroyed in return. Then we project it out and wind up seeing ourselves as victims of all kinds of things, such as financial problems. The problem, thus, is no longer our guilt over the separation and our wish to stay separated, but something external to us. The self- accusation of being the victimizer is gone from our awareness. We no longer even think we have a mind. So what would be helpful is for you to step back from your worrying, as an observer, and try to see the problem as a smokescreen hiding the real problem, which is the guilt in your mind. You don't have to stop worrying or being concerned. You need only look squarely at the purpose the problem serves, and then ask Jesus or the Holy Spirit to help you with that. Problems are defenses or smokescreens; they represent a decision to stay away from our minds and become absorbed in the world and our bodies so that we would never know that all of our experiences are the effects of decisions we are currently making in our minds and that we can change. And only two decisions are possible: to reinforce separation, or to undo it. Finally, always keep in mind that nothing in the world can ever affect the inner peace that is a permanent part of your identity, unless you give a person or situation in the world the power to do so. That would be nothing more than a simple mistake that is open to instant correction by asking Jesus to help you see it differently."

What is the Course's attitude to vegetarianism and the whole issue of killing animals for food and clothing?",
    "output": "The principles in the Course that apply to this issue have been discussed in #120. A few brief thoughts to expand on that: Although the world itself is illusory, we still experience it as real, and so Jesus teaches us in that context to concentrate only on the purpose we give the world and our bodies: to reinforce our belief that there is life here, or to learn that \"There is no life outside of Heaven\" (T-23.II.19:1). If this world is fundamentally illusory, then nothing here is either holy or unholy. So if you were to concentrate on the purpose for which you use the world and the body, you would not get caught up in the kinds of issues that are bothering you. Moreover, a careful examination of our world would reveal that its basic operating principle is kill or be killed. It is a murderous system through and through. Survival of both \"living\" and \"non-living\" things in the world is always at the expense of something else. Even breathing results in the death of microorganisms; we kill insects, fungi, viruses, and bacteria all the time in order to stay healthy and to produce healthy fruits and vegetables, etc.; we never feel sorry for the thousands of termites we destroy to prevent our homes from being destroyed. And, to bring in the metaphysics of the Course again, if everything is just a fragment of the one ego (a thought, actually), then it does not matter whether you devour an apple, a lobster, alfalfa sprouts, or an animal; nor does it make any difference whether you cut down trees in order to have lumber for your house, or use the wool from sheep to make clothing. Nothing here is real; there is no hierarchy of illusions. The ego's first law of chaos is that there is such a hierarchy, which results in a very complicated life for all of us: different and competing standards and values and, above all, constant preoccupation with issues in the world and our bodies. That is the ego's secret motive for promoting a hierarchy of values in the world. It keeps the world and our existence in it quite real, which means the ego's existence is guaranteed. Issues such as vegetarianism are smokescreens produced by the ego to keep us from going back to our minds, where the one and only problem and its solution exist. Thus, if you bring everything back to purpose, you will be able to work with your concerns more effectively. Purpose is the only meaningful aspect of these issues that you should consider. Concentrating only on that will help you get in touch with the ego's secret strategy, which is always to keep you from your mind where you always can choose conflict or peace as your identity--the ego or Jesus as your teacher."

If so, would the state of anxiety be more valuable than the state of indifference from a spiritual perspective? Would this state of anxiety be the eve of awakening?",
    "output": "While your realization has been helpful to you in stepping back from your ego's fear and recognizing there is another way of looking at things, your description would not, strictly speaking, be consistent with the Course's approach. Within the framework of A Course in Miracles, only love is real and fear does not exist (T-in), and so they can not share a common origin or basis. A slight modification in one of your statements, however, would be consistent with Course principles: What the ego perceives with fear, the right mind perceives with love. But whenever we speak of anything as being perceived, we are discussing the illusory realm of duality from which love has, by its very nature, been excluded. So what would be the basis for your insight, from the Course's perspective? It may be a reflection of the recognition that always, beneath the fear, is the memory of love. As a result, whatever the ego has made to maintain the reality of guilt and fear in our mind, when seen through the Holy Spirit's gentle perception, becomes a reminder of the love that it was made to conceal (T-12.I.9-10). And so the purpose of everything can always be transformed from the ego's to the Holy Spirit's. With respect to your closing questions, no ego state in itself is more valuable than another. The key to practicing forgiveness, the Course tells us, is to be able to identify our ego in whatever form it appears, whether it be anxiety or indifference or any of its other myriad manifestations (T-15.X.4:2-5; 5:1-3; T-23.III.1-2). Only then can we ask for help in acknowledging the underlying guilt that is fueling these projections, so that it can be released. For to be in denial of our ego reactions is to deny ourselves the opportunity for healing. Any recognition that the ego is controlling our thinking opens the door to the possibility of awakening from our nightmare dream."

    "text_input": "Q #450: Given the title of the book, I'm surprised to see so little discussion in this Q&A of the exact meaning and nature of the usage of \"miracle\" in A Course in Miracles. What is the relationship between a holy instant and a miracle? It seems to me that the holy instant is a more mature understanding of the real meaning of \"miracle,\" as that term is used in the Course.",
    "output": "These two terms are defined in Kenneth's Glossary-Index as follows (in part): A miracle is an occurrence in the mind, nothing external. The term refers to the change of mind that shifts our perception from the ego's world of sin, guilt, and fear, to the Holy Spirit's world of forgiveness. It reverses projection by restoring to the mind its causative function, allowing us to choose again. The holy instant is that instant outside time in which we choose the miracle instead of a grievance, the Holy Spirit instead of the ego, forgiveness instead of guilt. The holy instant is the expression of our willingness to live in the present, which opens into eternity, rather than holding on to the past and fearing the future, which keeps us in hell. (See #26 for an expanded description of the holy instant.) The two terms are distinct, as Jesus uses them to address two distinct misperceptions in our minds that resulted from our decision to believe that the separation from God actually happened. Jesus is thus emphasizing different aspects of the correction needed in our thinking to get us back to our natural state of oneness. His teachings about the miracle, in general, are meant to correct our tendency to think that our fundamental problems and their solutions are outside us--in the world and the body. And in speaking about the holy instant, in general, Jesus is correcting our habitual focus on the past and the future to justify our unforgiveness and our fear. In one sense, the meanings of all terms coalesce, as they refer to a single mistaken thought and the correction of that thought, and so while Jesus would be emphatic about the meaning of his message, he would give his students some latitude with the terms he has chosen. The content-- his message and our acceptance of it--is far more important to him than the form--the terms in which he expresses his message."

    "output": "The \"they\" referred to in the above quote from the manual for teachers are what A Course in Miracles refers to as the Teachers of teachers, those who have transcended all worldly limitations and have remembered their Identity perfectly (M-26.2:1-3). From our ego-based perspective as figures in the dream, they would seem to be other figures in the dream who have awakened, such as Jesus. However, we must remember that we are the dreamer of the dream, not the figure in the dream, and so it would be more accurate to say that such Teachers are symbols within our dream of the Answer, pure manifestations of the Holy Spirit--egoless thoughts that remind us of the truth of ourselves. The thought behind each such symbol is abstract, but the form they may appear to take will be whatever form our own mind gives to them that allows us to hear the message of correction without increasing our fear. And so, while we still believe we are separate, they will also seem to us to be separate (T-25.I.5:1), because that is what will be least threatening and most helpful to us. The form could be an intuition, an inner voice, a book, music, a person, etc. The specific form is always irrelevant to the purpose. All that matters is the message of love, which will be a reminder to ourselves to forgive, regardless of the form it appears to take."

    "output": "Yes, we can be guided by love to yell at someone. If we are identified with love and our ego is not involved at all, then the love would be expressed in whatever form would be appropriate in the situation. The key, though, is to get our egos out of the way, which is not that easy to do. The ego is very shrewd and deceptive, and always wants nothing more than to perpetuate its own existence, but make it appear as though something else is going on. So, often it disguises itself in the form of love and concern, which in many cases is but a means used to justify attack. We all have had the experience of realizing much later that what we thought was a right-minded interaction was only a veiled attack. So we must exercise extreme caution with this kind of approach. With much practice, we can become familiar with our favorite means of self- deception, and then we can be more alert to the kinds of traps we are apt to fall into. Surely, there are many people who can be reached only by being yelled at--adolescents and immature young adults being prime examples. But proceed with caution! The ego will seize any opportunity to unload guilt and hatred onto someone else and make it look as if it is a charitable act."

    "text_input": "Q #453: \"Forgive your Father it was not His Will that you be crucified\" (T-24.III.8:13) to me is one of the most important statements in A Course in Miracles. It contains the key to our release, yet it shows the main reason for our resistance to this release. Your comments on this statement would be most welcome.",
    "output": "Well said! Leading up to this grand conclusion, Jesus says, \"Forgive the great Creator of the universe, the Source of life ... for your illusions of your specialness. Here is the hell you chose to be your home. He chose not this for you. Ask not He enter this ... Forgive the Holy One the specialness He could not give, and that you made instead\" (T-24.III.6:1-4,7). The ego has tried, from the very beginning, to implicate God in the horrors and suffering in the world, and in our personal lives. How wonderful it would be, for the ego, if God were held to be ultimately responsible for everything, which of course is exactly what is proclaimed in the Bible and the religions and philosophies based on the Bible. Here in A Course in Miracles, and specifically in the passage you cite, Jesus is correcting that eons-old belief. God has nothing to do with the vicious world of specialness and crucifixion. He could not. Love can only love. That is why we have to forgive God; He is not part of our insanity, despite our desperately wanting Him to be. Therefore, if crucifixion is in our lives, we are the ones who put it there, and want it there. That is a bitter pill to swallow for most of us, and we would resist it with all our might, because we would then have to admit that we have been wrong about every single thing we have ever thought. Our lives--our thoughts and emotions--are turned upside down, and we break out in a cold sweat in the face of such an awesome accusation. To hold others-- ultimately God-- responsible for our perceptions of crucifixion thus protects us from the deeply buried belief that we are the ones who crucified infinite love so that our own need for specialness could be satisfied. Jesus is exposing this deception, while assuring us that looking with him at this deep, dark secret is the only way we will ever be liberated permanently from all the pain and death that mark our lives in this world. There is nothing that stands in the way of this freedom other than our own choice to be right rather than happy. And that is not sinful--just silly."

I know that we have no separate selves, and I want to help my family regain the knowledge I have found through A Course in Miracles. Are there any books or audio programs that I can use with my boys?",
    "output": "We have addressed other questions along these lines: #179 and #202. The Course is best taught by example. If you are centered in the love of Jesus, your boys would sense something about you that would help them learn forgiveness without ever realizing what was happening. Your attitude towards them--when the love of Jesus is doing the parenting, not your ego--would give them the only thing they truly need, which is to know that they are loved and forgiven, and that their mistakes have had no effect on your love for them, and never could. Your inner peace would be the teacher, and they would recognize it, even as you maintain your authority as their father. From that they would be learning how to interact with their friends and with each other. Perhaps later on, when they begin to question on a deeper level, you can introduce some of the concepts of the Course to them. But their primary goal at that young age-- and for many year to come--is to learn how to successfully function in the world as egos. They need your loving help to grow to be strong, confident individuals, who can get along in the world and are enthusiastically looking forward to careers in the world. It would not be helpful at all for them to be told that the world and they themselves are illusions and were made to attack God. Most adults can't handle that!"

This is dividing our country (separatism). I work in the social service arena and one third of my colleagues are Maori. We are constantly being reminded that this is \"their land\" and if we are finding it difficult to adjust to change, how must it have felt for them all those years ago. Our agency is putting a huge amount of time and money into fostering this separatism as is the rest of the Country. How can one view this from a micro to a macro level, according to A Course in Miracles?",
    "output": "How you perceive this situation in terms of the content in your mind is the key to getting past your dilemma. As soon as you catch yourself perceiving in \"we-they\" terms, you know you have chosen the ego thought system; the same is true if you perceive victimization. Ego solutions always wind up with separation or division, both in form and content. Its version of justice is that someone must win and someone must lose. If, in your mind, you can rise above the battleground and perceive the situation from a right- minded perspective, the differences you perceive in form would not affect your inner conviction that we are all the same as God's Son (the content). \"Nothing so blinding as perception of form\" (T-22.III.6:7). Both Maoris and English share the same interests; they share the same wrong- minded thinking and the same right-minded thinking, as well as the capacity to choose between the two. You can keep yourself from drifting away from this by concentrating as much as you can on purpose, as A Course in Miracles teaches us to ask: \"What is it for?\" (T-17.VI.2:2) This will simplify your approach to all of your interactions during the day. You can ask yourself frequently what you want to come of all this: to continue to see conflict, division, and winners and losers; or to see a common sharing beyond the outward appearance of differences. \"The principle that justice means no one can lose is crucial to this course. For miracles depend on justice. Not as it is seen through this world's eyes, but as God knows it and as knowledge is reflected in the sight the Holy Spirit gives ... Everyone is equally entitled to His [the Holy Spirit's] gift of healing and deliverance and peace\" (T-25.IX.5:4-6; 7:4). This requires some rather hard work--internally--because we are so accustomed to thinking and perceiving in terms of one-or-the-other, winners and losers. One group is up, the other is down; then it gets reversed. But there is still separation. There is no way around this unless we ask for help from the source in our minds that is beyond all perception of separation, and where justice has been returned to love (T-25.VIII)."

    "text_input": "Q #456: This is a three-part question:  : My understanding of the teachings of A Course in Miracles is that eventually we realize we are all one spirit. Do we then lose our awareness or memory of the experiences we had as individuals? Jesus figured out the truth while here on earth, yet seems to interact with those of us still experiencing the dream of individuality as the individual Jesus. So will the rest of us, after we realize the truth, still retain our individual selves? I realize I am asking this question as someone who likes my \"self\" and the other selves I interact with, i.e., family and friends.",
    "output": "Your awareness of yourself as an individual will last only as long as you value that identity. It is never taken away by Jesus or the Holy Spirit. The focus of our study and practice is learning that our interests are really the same, not separate; and that would lead us to the next step, which is recognizing that not only do we share the same interests, but we share the same self as well. We all share the same ego thought system, and we all share the same right-minded thought system of forgiveness, as well as the power to choose between the two. As long as we are attracted to an identity as an individual self, though, we will resist this teaching rather strenuously. There would have to be some motivation to move beyond individuality, and what Jesus teaches us is that if we looked deeply and honestly at our lives as individual selves, we would conclude that we are paying a heavy price to sustain that existence. That does not mean it is bad or wrong to enjoy existing in this world. He asks only that we look openly at the picture, and not be deceived by the glitter of the frame (T-17.IV.8-9). \"The body is a limit on love\" (T-18.VIII.1:2). So valuing bodily existence is valuing limited love. That is the connection Jesus wants us to make, just so that we could be aware that we are deliberately (once we remember we are decision-making minds) cutting ourselves off from the totality of the love that comes with the memory of our oneness as God's Son. Again, liking your self and your family and friends is not wrong or bad; just be aware that this is not all you are or they are. If living in this world is working for you and you are happy and content with it, then it would be foolish to change it. Recall that the Course came to two people who were no longer content with the way things were going and were determined to find a \"better way.\" Jesus stands outside the dream of individuality gently helping us to awaken from it. He appears to be an individual relating to us as individuals, but if you consider the above quote about the body being a limit on love, you can begin to understand that he appears that way because we choose to see him that way. Love is abstract--formless-- but our perception conforms to our identity. Were we to let go of the need to limit love, we would experience Jesus quite differently--and ourselves as well. The trouble is, we don't consciously realize that this is what we are doing, which is why so much of the Course is directed at helping us realize that we have a mind and that practically everything we do is a defense against our realizing that. We don't want to remember we are decision-making minds, because on some level we know where that realization would take us. We would eventually see clearly what individuality is all about, and it would not be a very pretty picture. To avoid those consequences, we try to make Jesus like us, but that will never square with what he spends so much time teaching us in the Course. It is much more helpful, and would reduce the internal conflict, to state simply and honestly, that you like being a self amidst other individual selves, and that some day you may have a reason to reconsider that choice, but right now you don't. Period! That's where you are, and it's okay. Jesus' love for you is not lessened in the least. : What are our real creations? Are they what are left when we awake from the dream? Are we creating even as we dream? A: Please see #103 for the definition of creations. Nothing real ever takes place in the dream. The Self that never left Its Source continually creates, which means simply that love always extends itself. : If it only takes one to awake from the dream for all to awake and one cannot find Atonement alone and Jesus achieved this, why are the rest of us still dreaming? A: From our perspective within the dream, there is no way of our comprehending this process; it cannot be solved through logical reasoning. Our framework for understanding is severely limited, because we believe we are actually here, and that belief is intended to push truth away and replace it with another system of thought that is entirely false. Very humbling! It is virtually impossible for us not to think in terms of separate bodies in time and space, but Jesus is not referring to bodies in time and space. Nevertheless, we can say at least this much--that there is one mind, and the illusion of many minds, all asleep and dreaming. When you are in the real world you know there is only one mind. So the only mind that needs to awaken is yours."

By a series of circumstances I am at the point of ruin and bankruptcy. I read the Lesson that tells me to step back and let the spirit lead the way. How do you do that? How do you know that it is the spirit? I try to let it lead yet I must be doing something wrong because here I stand at the edge.",
    "output": "We easily fall into the trap of believing that the Holy Spirit's answer to our call for help would be a change in the external situation--the world or the body. We forget that problems in our bodies and the world are the effect; and the cause is our belief that we separated from God and destroyed love to achieve that separation. Thus in Chapter 27, Jesus reminds us that the Holy Spirit \"looks not to effects ... He bids you bring each terrible effect to Him that you may look together on its foolish cause and laugh with Him a while. You judge effects, but He has judged their cause. And by His judgment are effects removed. Perhaps you come in tears. But hear him say, 'My brother, holy Son of God, behold your idle dream, in which this could occur.' And you will leave the holy instant with your laughter and your brother's joined with His\" (T-27.VIII.9:1,3-8). Understandably, this may not be very consoling when you are on the verge of ruin, and you would much prefer that the Holy Spirit intervene to make things better for you in the world. He can't, because He doesn't see a world. He would help you get to the point where you share that perception with Him, so that you would be at peace regardless of what seems to be happening outside you. The problem is we don't realize--and probably don't believe--that what Jesus and the Holy Spirit say is outside us is really outside us. We think that this is really us. They know it's not! How better could He help us, then, than to teach us how to begin the process of disidentifying with our identities as part of the world; and what better time to do that than when we are deeply troubled by problems in the world and our bodies. Challenging, yes; and seemingly impossible, yes. But that is what this Course is about. And that does not mean that you should not do everything you possibly can to rectify the financial situation--consulting a financial advisor, etc. Jesus assures us many times, that if we walk our path with the willingness to grow to value nothing but his love, and to accept that as our identity, we can go through the most horrendous (from the world's point of view) situations and still be at peace within. That is not easy, and it means letting go of any investment in having the problem in the world be solved in a particular way."

    "text_input": "Q #458: Is the \"afterlife\" an ego-based concept? How does one continue practicing the concepts of A Course in Miracles when we are no longer in physical form?",
    "output": "Yes, it is an ego-based concept, simply because it implies \"life\" that begins, changes, and ends. A primary principle of A Course in Miracles is that \"there is no life outside of Heaven. Where God created life, there life must be. In any state apart from Heaven life is illusion ... Life not in Heaven is impossible, and what is not in Heaven is not anywhere\" (T-23.II.19.1-4). In addition, in the manual for teachers Jesus addresses the idea of a soul or other entity that continues after the body dies: \"The curious belief that there is part of dying things that may go on apart from what will die, does not proclaim a living God nor re-establish any grounds for trust. If death is real for anything, there is no life. Death denies life. But if there is reality in life, death is denied. No compromise in this is possible\" (M-27.4:1-5). Thus anything that appears to die in any way cannot be real. These statements are part of what we call Level One of the Course. On the other hand, there are many places in the Course where Jesus strongly implies reincarnation--our coming back many times until we complete our forgiveness lessons. This is the other level of the Course--Level Two. The emphasis, though, is always on the mind, not the physical form. Jesus is helping us to realize that there is no life in the physical form, or in any form, for that matter. There is only a mind that thinks it is a body so that it can forget it is a decision-making mind, because it has associated being a mind with sin, guilt, and fear of annihilation by God from Whom it stole its life. It is always the mind that practices the Course; Jesus is always addressing us as decision-making minds, not bodies. As we practice forgiveness and learn more and more how to perceive ourselves as all sharing a common interest, our identification with the body (form), begins to diminish, and we re-establish our identities as minds. Part of this process involves reorienting our thinking about death--as a thought in our minds, not a physical event, though it appears to be a physical event. \"We know that an idea leaves not its source. And death is the result of the thought we call the ego, as surely as life is the result of the Thought of God\" (T-19.IV-C.2:14-15). So the more we learn to think of ourselves as minds, the less identified we are with our bodies (homo sapiens). We will reach the point when we realize that nothing happens to our minds when the body dies, because we were never in the body to begin with. The body was simply a projection of the mind. If our minds are not yet healed, we will continue that process in whatever form we choose that will be most helpful. We are never not in our minds."

He also states that the Trinity is One, in Truth, which is beyond our understanding. Within the illusion, I can accept that God \"knows absolutely nothing\" about His Son's dream, while the Holy Spirit obviously does know about it in order to correct our perceptions. In reality--which we cannot possibly comprehend--I prefer not to speculate about or assume what God \"knows\" or \"doesn't know.\" This makes sense to me. Am I confused?",
    "output": "One of the major purposes of A Course in Miracles is to correct what it sees as the mistakes of Judaeo-Christian theology. And the cornerstone of that tradition is that God not only knows about the world--He is its Creator--but He is integrally involved in it. So by stating that God knows nothing of what is not His Being--because it is impossible that there be anything other than His Being--Jesus is correcting all biblically-based theologies, as well as any others that hold that God is involved in the world. The implications of this correction are far-reaching, to put it mildly. Obviously, religious practices flowing from those theologies would no longer have any foundation. But most devastating of all is the clear implication that our so-called lives as individuals do not have a divine origin or destiny, and, worst of all, have no reality. Reality, according to A Course in Miracles is non-dualistic; it is the pure oneness of Love, God's Being, which extends eternally, though not in any sense that is comprehensible to us in our separated state. It would seem that in a strict non-dualism, \"knowing something\" is an impossibility, as there is no knower and known. There is no \"what\" for God to \"know.\" In fact, the meaning of the term knowledge in the Course is equated with Heaven, the state of perfect Oneness--radically different from its conventional meaning, which is based on a subject-object dichotomy. Although there are many statements in the Course with profoundly rich theoretical implications, its emphasis is always on the practical goal of reversing our journey into the hell of separation back in the direction of our home in Heaven as God's one Son. \"This is not a course in philosophical speculation, nor is it concerned with precise terminology. It is concerned only with Atonement, or the correction of perception. The means of the Atonement is forgiveness\" (C-in.1:1-3). In oft-quoted passages from Lesson 169, Jesus gives us a sense of the ineffability of God's Being and how we may re-unite with our Source: \"Oneness is simply the idea God is ... We say 'God is,' and then we cease to speak, for in that knowledge words are meaningless. There are no lips to speak them, and no part of mind sufficiently distinct to feel that it is now aware of something not itself. It has united with its Source. And like its Source Itself, it merely is. We cannot speak nor write nor even think of this at all. It comes to every mind when total recognition that its will is God's has been completely given and received completely ... This is beyond experience we try to hasten\" (W-pI.169.5:1,4-7; 6:1-2; 7:1). And so you are quite correct in not wanting to speculate about God's Being. Jesus refers to such inclinations as \"senseless musings\" (W-pI.139.8:5), and he would much rather have us spend our time practicing forgiveness."

The only solution needed to any perceived problem is available now, in the holy instant, when we recognize that our interests are not separate from our brothers. \"Even at the level of the most casual encounter, it is possible for two people to lose sight of separate interests, if only for a moment. That moment will be enough. Salvation has come\" (M-3.2:6-8). Psychological health, which our egos have taught us to value, is, in the end, irrelevant to the decision to join in the present."

    "output": "God cannot be in the illusion, as you suspect. That would make no sense. Likewise, there is no life force within the illusion, either. \"There is no life outside of Heaven\" (T-23.II.19:1), as the Course teaches uncompromisingly throughout. What appears to us to be living bodies are projections of our minds, which have made the decision to identify with the ego's thought system of separation, and thereby do everything possible to keep us from remembering that life is only the perfect Oneness of God in Heaven. There is only one thought that fragments over and over and over (T-18.I.4). Throughout A Course in Miracles Jesus tries to help us realize that everything we are perceiving are figures in a dream we (our minds) are dreaming. \"There is no world apart from what you wish ... Ideas leave not their source\" (W-pI.132.5:1,3). Referring to the body Jesus says, \"What you have given 'life' is not alive, and symbolizes but your wish to be alive apart from life, alive in death, with death perceived as life, and living, death\" (T-29.II.6:2). If this sounds confusing, it is because it is confusing, as Jesus further explains: \"Confusion follows on confusion here, for on confusion has this world been based, and there is nothing else it rests upon\" (T-29.II.6:3). That is why we need help from someone outside this delusional system, and why we cannot rely on our perception to tell us what is real and what is not real. We are too mixed up to know! Jesus heads us back in the right direction by training us to focus on the purpose of how we think and behave. We are too terrified and too invested in having separation be real to immediately cease our hallucinations of physical life, although in principle we could (T-20.VIII.7-9). So Jesus launches us on a mind-training program that gently helps us to reverse our course into insanity (seeing something that is not there). And the heart of that process is learning first to identify the ego purpose that is behind most of what we do--seeing our interests as separate from others and always in conflict with them--and then asking for help to accept the Holy Spirit's purpose, which is to see our interests as the same as everyone else's. As that becomes more and more natural to us, our identification with the body will grow less and less, and we will become more comfortable first thinking and then experiencing ourselves as minds. At the end of that process, which takes many, many years, the unreality of physical life will dawn on us. We do not have to force ourselves to stop perceiving as we do. The shift will happen of itself, as we concentrate on purpose and motivation."

I now have such a place, an extra room in the house, but it's as if I see homeless people everywhere--refugees who are told to leave the country but cannot go back to their own country; and I feel so bad. What is loving action? I have an extra room; they have no room. If I would really let go of my personal interests, I could give that room to someone, but I'm not sure if I would be able to cope. I feel as if I'm torn apart here: if I want something for myself, I'm hurting another human being. And if I help someone else, it's as if I'm hurting myself. This cannot be right. There does not seem to be a solution where everybody feels peace.",
    "output": "\"This cannot be right.\" Absolutely! The ego has snuck into your work with the Course, which it is ingenious at doing to us all. Whenever you feel trapped in the conflict of sacrifice--one or the other, \"damned if I do; damned if I don't\"--you know for sure that you have wandered out of Jesus' classroom into the ego's. In the ego's classroom, students are programmed to pay attention only to form and to forget all about content. In Jesus' classroom, content is everything; in fact it is the only aspect of our lives that is truly meaningful and relevant to our Atonement process. So seeing your interests as the same as everyone else's refers only to the content in your mind. Loving action flows from the content of experiencing everyone as sharing with you the same wrong-minded thought system and the same right-minded thought system, as well as the power to choose between the two. When in a holy instant you are identified with that content alone, you could be guided to take in a homeless person or not to. And whether you do or you don't would not matter to you. It would not be an issue. The act of taking in a homeless person can be right-minded or wrong-minded; it is not automatically a holy and spiritual act. That is where the ego always gets us--in its exclusive emphasis on form and behavior. There is nothing in A Course in Miracles about behavior, because Jesus is interested only in what takes place in our minds, the seat of all of our problems, and also their solutions. It takes a great deal of retraining of our minds to shift from our focus on behavior to the content in our minds. That is the process of thought-reversal that is the burden of the lessons in the workbook. It does not seem loving to turn away those in need, especially if you seem to have the means to help them; but, again, that is a page from the ego's manual, which programs its students to focus on victims and victimizers in this world of separate, needy individuals. The ego is behind the sanctification of sacrifice, as it deceptively fulfills the ego's purpose of keeping us rooted in guilt and conflict. Thus, lurking beneath the dilemma you are experiencing--whether to help another or yourself-- is the insidious attraction to guilt. That is the \"real\" problem, which remains concealed by the smokescreen of external conflicts (both physical and psychological). So the part of you that remains committed to upholding the ego thought system of guilt will secretly delight in having dilemmas in your life, because they seem so genuine and they keep your attention away from the real source of your anguish, which is your decision to turn away from love once again. That decision preceded the homeless-person dilemma. You could not experience guilt and anguish if you did not want to. If that is where you wind up, it must have been your goal at the outset. (T-5.VII.6; T-21.II.2) And that therefore is what you want to ask Jesus or the Holy Spirit to help you with--not whether or not to take in a homeless person. Contrary to the world's thinking, that is not the important factor: you either do it or don't, but that is not the problem. The guilt that you are holding on to in your mind is the only factor that is of interest to Jesus or the Holy Spirit. And that is not a cruel or heartless approach when you remember the cardinal principle of the Course: the world is but the \"witness to your state of mind, the outside picture of an inward condition\" (T-21.in.1:5). The world was made to present us with endless dilemmas that appear to be outside us, so that we would never remember that the real dilemma is our terror that if we are guilt-free, love will be all that is left; there will no longer be a self that can be consumed by guilt and anguish. Strange! But then, Jesus never said we are all that sane."

    "text_input": "Q #463: The answers to the questions in this forum often refer to \"Jesus or the Holy Spirit.\" The writings of Ken Wapnick do as well. In studying A Course in Miracles, I have always been more comfortable with the term \"Holy Spirit\" than with the term \"Jesus.\" While I do not question the authority of Jesus, or his authorship of his Course, I do have a problem using Jesus--a physical person--as a visualizing device for receiving guidance. Somehow, to me, this goes against what we are trying to achieve in the Course, which is to see ourselves as a part of God's mind, connected to God, and not as a separated body. I recognize that as long as we perceive ourselves as a separate body, we need to have a separate \"higher power\" to guide us. But I am more comfortable with an abstract notion of the Holy Spirit, which is in our minds, than I am with the notion of a physical body called Jesus, who is obviously separate from my physical body. Even drawings of Jesus, when they are associated with the Course, bother me a bit, because a body is pictured, and a body stands for separation. I know the body is neutral, and not to be hated or loved. But my question regards whether my feelings are justified. Is the \"Holy Spirit\" a more refined, and perhaps better way to perceive and experience our connection with God, than to visualize a human body named Jesus? On the other hand, could my feelings relate to some kind of resistance to accepting Jesus? Or am I making a mountain out of a molehill here?",
    "output": "This is an important question, one which many other students have grappled with over the years. Some people find it easier to relate to the Holy Spirit as an abstract presence; and some people can relate better to the more personal presence of Jesus--both of course are in our minds. It does not matter which you choose, as they are identical in function; Jesus is the manifestation of the Holy Spirit. What alone is important is to experience a relationship with some symbol that reflects the loving source behind the symbol of Jesus, some symbol that helps you experience love as oneness as intimately as possible. \"The name of Jesus Christ as such is but a symbol. But it stands for love that is not of this world\" (M-23.4:1-2). And obviously, if you choose Jesus you need not have pictures or images all around. It is interesting to observe how, even with the \"abstract\" Holy Spirit, many people still use an image of some kind--usually a dove or other kind of bird. The Course itself uses bodily symbols: the Holy Spirit is referred to as He, a Teacher, a Voice, and a Mediator, for example. As you suggest, it might be helpful for you to look into the possibility that you are harboring some feelings about Jesus (or the body) that could be causing you to keep your distance. Relating to him as a separate person does not really go against what we are trying to achieve in the Course. In fact, as you know, he encourages us to do just that. To cite just two of many passages: \"Try to pass the clouds [of guilt] by whatever means appeals to you. If it helps you, think of me holding your hand and leading you. And I assure you this will be no idle fantasy\" (W-pI.70.9:2- 4). \"Walking with him is just as natural as walking with a brother whom you knew since you were born, for such indeed he is. Some bitter idols have been made of him who would be only brother to the world. Forgive him your illusions, and behold how dear a brother he would be to you\" (C-5.5:6-9). If we do this \"right,\" we would not confine our relationship with him to the physical realm, because he would never want us to, given his evaluation of the body (for example, T-19.IV- A.17:5-6; T-19.IV-B.14). Unfortunately, though, that is what has happened in most mainstream Christian religions. Lesson 151 is a particularly helpful lesson to study in this context. It illustrates so well how Jesus teaches us. He starts with what we know best--what our senses tell us and how we believe what they tell us with \"stubborn certainty\"--and then he leads us beyond that so that we can be free of conflict and \"pain, disaster, suffering, and loss\" (W-pI.151.5,10). What a loving, gentle way to teach! Thus the focus of a relationship with Jesus is not so much on him as a body, as much as it is on the love he represents, because that is the way we will regain our awareness of love's presence which we have strenuously and determinedly sought to block by choosing the body as our reality. When we near the end of our journey, the last stage in the development of trust (M- 4.I.A), we realize that there is only one love; there is no \"Jesus and me\"; there is no separation. But of course that is our greatest fear--the disappearance of our individual selves. Yet that happens only when we accept, like Jesus, that our only identity is love. Then we are safe and loss is impossible. \"Love is your safety. Fear does not exist. Identify with love, and you are safe. Identify with love, and you are home. Identify with love, and find your Self\" (W-pII.5.5:4-8). So you might want to dwell more on what you pointed out in your question; that is, that as long as we perceive ourselves as a separate body, we need to have a separate \"higher power\" to guide us. The reflection of Heaven's Love comes to us in bodily terms in the Course purposively. It would be impossible for us to get even the faintest hint of that Love without it being represented--at least in the early stages of our journey--in bodily form. Our investment in believing that the physical realm is reality is far too strong, and our terror of it not being reality even stronger. Relating to Jesus as someone just like us, therefore, is extremely helpful in avoiding the common mistake, often having disastrous consequences both physically and spiritually, of skipping steps--of denying our physical experience, bodily needs, etc., and jumping right into the realm of spirit. Jesus asks us, \"Can you who see yourself within a body know yourself as an idea? Everything you recognize you identify with externals, something outside itself. You cannot even think of God without a body, or in some form you think you recognize (T-18.VIII.1:5-7). So the gentle path of the Course is to have us be fully present to our bodily experience as long as we think we are bodies, but to ask Jesus to help us use those experiences to get to the pain in our minds coming from our ongoing decision to choose our own limited version of love rather than accept our true Identity as part of the oneness of unlimited Love, symbolized in our minds by the loving presence of our brother Jesus."
