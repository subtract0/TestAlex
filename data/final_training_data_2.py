    "text_input": "Q #464: How can I get release from jealousy? For years I have been in denial concerning this emotion. I have recently come to realize that I will not get very far with A Course in Miracles if this issue is not addressed. I have tried asking God for forgiveness but when I ask for forgiveness it is my ego speaking and not the true me, whoever that may be. My own ego mind lulls me into a false sense of security by saying I do not have to do anything about the issue of jealousy. Can you please help me apply the Course to this issue?",
    "output": "Jealousy is addressed in the same way every other ego emotion is. The first step, which you've taken, is acknowledging that it is there. The second step is recognizing that jealousy is not really the problem. As Jesus tells us early in the workbook, \"I am never upset for the reason I think\" (W-pI.5). And he goes on to say: \"This idea ... can be used with any person, situation or event you think is causing you pain. Apply it specifically to whatever you believe is the cause of your upset, using the description of the feeling in whatever term seems accurate to you. The upset may seem to be fear, worry, depression, anxiety, anger, hatred, jealousy or any number of forms, all of which will be perceived as different. This is not true. However, until you learn that form does not matter, each form becomes a proper subject for the exercises for the day. Applying the same idea to each of them separately is the first step in ultimately recognizing they are all the same\" (W-pI.5.1, italics added). And so what are we upset about if not what we think the problem is? We believe unconsciously that we have attacked love by separating from it. And this attack arose because we jealously believed that God had what we lacked, and had been keeping it from us. The guilt over our attack is so unbearable that we had to make up a world to hide that guilt from ourselves. The complexity of the world, with all its various problems and accompanying emotions, becomes our preoccupation, assuring that we never get back to the simplicity of the problem of the belief in separation in our mind. Although you do not mention the specific forms that your jealousy takes, it is an expression of the thought that someone else either has what we want or will take it away from us. No matter the specific expression, it is always simply the thought of separation in disguised form, with responsibility for its consequences projected outside ourselves. We want to acknowledge the jealous feelings, recognizing what they represent and how they keep the feeling of deprivation and lack alive in our minds, with its painful cost. And jealousy of course serves the ego purpose of seeing the responsibility for our lack as resting outside ourselves, in others whom we see as having the power to take and keep what rightfully should be ours. The problem of jealousy then is addressed by returning responsibility for our feelings of fear and lack back to ourselves, within our own minds, where the Answer also lies. Only then can we recognize that the love we have jealously sought to gain and maintain has been ours all along, with no need for any pursuit or defense."

    "text_input": "Q #465: I always understood that in A Course in Miracles Jesus never asks us to do anything in the world, except in how to do the workbook lessons. Then I rediscover in Chapter 12: \"Recognize what does not matter, and if your brothers ask you for something 'outrageous,' do it because it does not matter\" (T-12.III.4:1). I have also read your question and answer #60. This does not answer why he is telling us to \"do something in the world.\" If there is no world, why do something that my brother wants me to do?",
    "output": "The context of this statement appears in the preceding two paragraphs, and it is essential to realize that Jesus is not talking about form or behavior, but about the content in our minds. Thus he explains that the other person's \"very insistence should tell you that he believes salvation lies in it. If you insist on refusing and experience a quick response of opposition, you are believing that your salvation lies in not doing it. You, then, are making the same mistake he is, and are making his error real to both of you\" (T-12.III.2:2-4). The content Jesus is pointing out to us is the error of believing that what we do or do not do in the world is important and in some way related to our salvation: \"Insistence means investment, and what you invest in is always related to your notion of salvation\" (2:5). Even though he knows the world is not real, he shows us how to use our experiences in the world as a classroom so that we can discover the specific mistakes we are making in our thinking, why they occur, and what to do about them. He is always teaching us about the content in our minds, not our behavior. His teachings will always be misunderstood if this distinction is not recognized. Therefore in the context of adamantly refusing to do what another asks of us, Jesus is saying that what will help us undo the separation and learn that salvation has nothing to do with the world is to join with the other person by doing what seems \"outrageous,\" remembering of course that \"this does not mean to do a foolish thing that would hurt either him or you, for what would hurt one will hurt the other\" (T-16.I.6:5)."

    "text_input": "Q #466: For many years I tried every conceivable method to give up my nicotine addiction. After my last failure, I decided I would not put myself through the ordeal of stopping ever again, resigning myself to being a smoker for the rest of my life. One morning I awoke at my usual time, but I did not open my eyes. Something was so very different. I felt like I was in heaven. Such peace and tranquility as I've never before felt led me to think I was dead. It was as if the ego had been taken away from me: I was nothing but I was everything. When I opened my eyes everything looked so different: pristine bright but gentle to the eyes. Nothing seemed physically real. I had no cravings, no desires and no thought of a cigarette. Over time the peace went away as I got back into ego mode, but I still have no interest in cigarettes. Today, I really do believe that a power far greater than my ego released me from my addiction to nicotine while I slept. Can you please apply the teachings of A Course in Miracles to this miracle of mine?",
    "output": "Contrary as it may seem to your experience, the Course would not attribute divine intervention to a happening such as you recount. The Course's metaphysics makes it clear that God has nothing to do with the world (T-11.VII.1; W-pI.166.2; C-4.1)--our own minds determine the form of our experiences (W-pII.325.1:1-4). Now that is not to deny that your experience--a very powerful one for you--may be a reflection of God's Love for you. But nevertheless it is your own mind that has set up the events that you found yourself experiencing, including the release from the addiction to nicotine--much as it determines the events of your dreams at night. At a level that you are not conscious of, your mind made the choice to accept peace rather than conflict. Your conscious decision to stop battling your addiction may have in part represented this shift. And your experience of egolessness when you awakened suggests that you allowed yourself to be in enough of a fear-free state to open your mind to experience symbols of the unitary, non-physical nature of mind and the illusory nature of the world and your body-- fundamental teachings of the Course. In such a state, personal needs do not exist (T-28.I.3:2). That you have carried over this recognition into your daily life in relationship to cigarettes simply means that you no longer need the defense against love that the nicotine has represented, as one in a large array of ego substitutes for love (T-16.V.12). For it is a decision of the mind that establishes an addiction to a particular form, and so it is a decision of the mind to release that particular addiction. In the end, when all our fear and guilt is gone, we will not need any ego substitutes for the love we really seek. Your experience has provided you with a helpful glimpse of where the Course is leading us, where we are all heading."

    "text_input": "Q #467: \"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you\" is thought to be the core of western morality and one of the most important messages of Jesus. From the perspective of A Course in Miracles it is a really confusing message, considering we do not know what is our own best interests when identifying with ego. Is there some rule within the Course's teaching that would reinterpret this golden rule?",
    "output": "There is only one place in the Course where Jesus mentions the Golden Rule, and that is in the first chapter: \"The Golden Rule is the rule for appropriate behavior. You cannot behave appropriately unless you perceive correctly. Since you and your neighbor are equal members of one family, as you perceive both so you will do to both. You should look out from the perception of your own holiness to the holiness of others\" (T-1.III.6:4-7). As you say, when we identify with the ego, we cannot know our own or anyone else's best interests. What is in our best interests is forgiveness and the undoing of the separation, which pertains only to the content in our minds, not behavior. Thus when we look on ourselves and others without judgment, and we see our interests as the same, not in opposition to everyone else's, then we have chosen against the ego and are in our right minds. We then share the perception of the Holy Spirit Who sees us all as one Son, and for that instant, at least, our actions will be guided solely by love. Jesus wants so very much for us to recognize the unfortunate consequences of our having fallen for the ego's teaching that our judgments and condemnations of others have no effect on us. The correction of that fallacy is at the core of his teaching, as explicitly found for example in these two lessons: \"It can be but myself I crucify\" (W-pI.196) and \"When I am healed I am not healed alone\" (W-pI.137)."

    "output": "It is not uncommon at all to have many people react negatively to the same person, as is readily apparent these days with public figures and celebrities. We all share the same ego thought system, which means we are all sending out the messengers of fear that Jesus talks about in the first obstacle to peace to find \"bad\" or obnoxious people onto whom we can project our unconscious guilt (T-19.IV-A.i).

    "text_input": "Q #469: I am wondering about my grandmother who has Alzheimer's Disease. What does A Course in Miracles say about this situation? She is not the same person, it just seems to be her body and not her soul. I was wondering if she was already in Heaven and her body was just left here on earth for the rest of us to learn some sort of lesson. Please help me understand this.",
    "output": "Watching someone deteriorate from this form of disease is not easy, and we hope that you are able to experience the peace deep within you and in your grandmother as you go through this. The Course's teachings about sickness are very difficult for most people to accept and relate to because it tells us that despite all appearances, the body is never sick, anymore than a puppet is sick because the puppeteer makes the puppet move and appear a certain way. The clear teaching in the Course is that the body does only what the mind tells it to do, and, more deeply, that the body is not an entity separate from the mind. Other systems teach that the soul leaves the body and goes to Heaven, but that is not what A Course in Miracles teaches. Sickness is made by the ego to reinforce our belief that we are bodies and not spirit; so all forms of sickness (there is no hierarchy among them) are a defense against the truth of Who we truly are as Christ (W-pI.136). We can never know the specifics of someone else's Atonement path (nor our own most of the time), but it is possible that your grandmother (as a decision-making mind) chose the condition of Alzheimer's to help others learn that they are not bodies and that this world is not our home. We don't know this. The condition of the body is not a clear indicator of what is going on in the mind since the identical bodily condition can reflect either a wrong-minded or a right-minded choice. So to apply the teachings of the Course in this type of a trying situation you first would simply respect her choice, and then try to see the situation as a classroom, focusing only on which teacher you are choosing to guide you through it: either the ego or Jesus. The ego would have you see your grandmother's deterioration as a terrible, unfortunate tragedy for which someone is to blame. Jesus would help you deal with your feelings and judgments and see beyond them to the light and love that define both you and your grandmother, as well as everyone else: \"It [the miracle] merely looks on devastation, and reminds the mind that what it sees is false ... it paves the way for the return of timelessness and love's awakening, for fear must slip away under the gentle remedy it brings\" (W-pII.13.1:3,6)."

    "text_input": "Q #470: In your answer to Question #231, you explain so fittingly: \"We are seeking to fill the void left by our seeming separation from God with substitutes for His Love that never fully satisfy us.\" Although intellectually I fully accept this, I sometimes seem to experience this void to such an extreme and with such intense psychological pain that it makes me feel almost physically sick. Sometimes the ego makes me try to compensate it by such foolish means as over consumption (i.e., food, music, learning, etc.), almost to the level of greed. How do I go about filling this big black hole (that is not even there) with His Love? Saying there is no hole does not disperse the illusion. Although Jesus teaches us the Love of God is everything I am, the illusion of the void is still there, and I am not at peace. Should I just accept that God takes me where I am and welcomes me? Or am I just taking it all much too seriously because nothing in this world is real anyway?",
    "output": "The pain of the deep sense of emptiness that you describe is the inevitable result of the choice for separation and is present, in some form, at the core of every separated one. It may be camouflaged, temporarily anesthetized, or denied, but it is the force behind every pursuit of relief and pleasure in specialness. Your awareness of this is an important step in the process of undoing the belief in separation, and learning to identify with the loving Self that is also present in everyone. You are correct in saying that while in the grips of separation's agony, it is no comfort to know that there is no void. You have a lot of company in that. There is nothing you can do to fill the void because it cannot be filled. There is no substitute for our true Identity, because there cannot be an opposite to truth. When it is denied, what is left is nothing; this is the void. The only way to heal the pain of separation is not to choose it. Only this obliterates the experience of the void, and is accomplished through forgiveness: \"Forgiveness is the healing of the perception of separation\" (T-3.V.9:1). Acknowledging the pain and its true source is a good beginning. Taking responsibility for having chosen separation in some form of specialness is another important step. A Course in Miracles is not teaching us to fill the void, only to practice forgiveness. The answer to your question may be found in the questions Jesus asks us: \"How willing are you to forgive your brother? How much do you desire peace instead of endless strife and misery and pain? These questions are the same, in different form. Forgiveness is your peace, for herein lies the end of separation and the dream of danger and destruction, sin and death; of madness and of murder, grief and loss\" (T-29.VI.1:1-4)."

    "text_input": "Q #471: Since I have turned my relationship over to the Holy Spirit I have noticed that the content is not totally aligned with A Course in Miracles. The other person is now dating someone else. Jesus says in \"The Healed Relationship\": \"Many relationships have been broken off at this point, and the pursuit of the old goal re-established in another relationship\" (T-17.V.3:8). But he also tells me to \"accept with gladness what you cannot understand\" (8:1) and that \"the means will surely fall in place because the goal is sure\" (14:8). Just because my experience is not totally aligned with the Course doesn't mean that the Holy Spirit forgot about me, right?",
    "output": "You couldn't be more right! The entire Course is about our learning that sin has no effect, and that nothing we do or think can affect the love we have for Jesus or the love he has for us. When we don't take our egos seriously, we are learning that \"not one note in Heaven's song was missed\" (T-26.V.5:4) just because we have insane thoughts. We need to apply that to ourselves when we realize we are not perfect in our practice of the Course. It is for most of us a very long process, and Jesus clearly is not expecting perfection of us--just honesty, humility, and willingness. If you are still desirous of a romantic relationship that makes you feel special, that is not wrong or sinful. Also, in the section you quoted, Jesus is talking about the content in our minds of moving beyond the specialness that is the mark of most romantic relationships. And when the goal of specialness is replaced by the goal of shared interests, sometimes it can feel as if the bottom has fallen out. All of the rituals of specialness are now empty and without meaning--and it can feel as if there is nothing left. That is when the temptation sets in to leave the relationship and find another one with the old form. The Holy Spirit helps us, not by getting us new romantic partners to fill our needs, but by helping us learn that our real need--our only need--is to get in touch with the painful cost of the special relationship. The content in this sense is forgiveness of our special relationships."

I have gone back and re-read the questions that have to do with forgiveness and I understand that the reason I am having a difficult time is that I am unhappy. I keep on asking for help to let go of these angry feelings, but my mind goes back to a certain person and I begin to feel angry again. I really want to let it go and stop thinking about the situation and the person.",
    "output": "It is not helpful, nor gentle, to try to force yourself to stop thinking about something, or to stop being angry. \"Do not fight yourself\" Jesus reminds us (T-30.I.1:7) in his characteristically gentle way of guiding us. You would be making progress if you were to say, simply and honestly, that you refuse to forgive this person, and then to forgive yourself for not wanting to forgive, knowing that Jesus loves you no less. Just accept where you are right now without making it into a big issue. The ego will try to get you one way or another; and one of its favorite tactics is to encourage you to beat up on yourself when you find forgiveness impossible. The end result of that is that the ego stays in business, and you remain in conflict. One day the cost to you of holding on to the grievance will be painful enough to motivate you to consider letting go. And even then you need not let it go; you need only consider how much more peaceful you would feel if you did. The ego will throw up all kinds of reasons to justify your continuing to condemn the other person; but in the end your attraction to the love and peace of Jesus' presence will allow that grievance to simply melt away. And you will be thankful to see how wrong you have been in blaming this other person and yourself. You will be at peace."

But can it be said that Jesus himself once believed in illusions? Was Jesus, before he became perfect with his Christ Self just like us, in that he was filled with illusions and he needed the Holy Spirit too in order to correct his thoughts?",

It certainly is one view that can be taken. Our view is that when the thought of separation happened in that one instant (the \"tiny, mad idea\"), just as quickly did Jesus accept the correction of it; and therefore he has always been outside the dream, available to help us make the same choice not to take the tiny, mad idea seriously.

    "text_input": "Q #474: In reference to #258, how does one \"look within\" specifically? Can you give a specific example of the \"looking within\" process using the example in that question? Do we talk with Jesus? What do we do? How do we \"allow the light of true forgiveness to shine upon our guilt\"?",
    "output": "Perhaps the process of looking within may become clearer when you consider what it is a correction for and what it is to be contrasted with. The ego would always have us look without-- to see all of our problems as related to externals--our own body and personality in relationship to other bodies and events, in the past, present or future. And so then \"forgiveness\" is always focused on what someone else has or has not done to us. Even our own guilt, according to the ego, arises from things we or others have done or have failed to do (including Christianity's notion of original sin, which we all have supposedly inherited as a result of the sinful disobedience of our first parents, Adam and Eve). All of this kind of looking outside is the ego's defense to keep us unaware that we have a mind to look within. So it is not surprising that you ask for clarification of what it means to look within. Although they are not the real problem, our seeming reactions to the externals, such as our anger at what someone else has done to us, are helpful first steps in the process of looking within, for these are the signals that alert us to the fact that there is something within to look at, if we are willing to release the ego as our teacher and accept the Holy Spirit as our Guide. Looking within means that we withdraw all of our projections for responsibility for how we feel from outside ourselves, including from the other person as well as from our own body. And then we look at our willingness to accept that everything we feel is coming from guilt over a decision hidden within our minds to value ourselves more than anyone or anything else, no matter what the cost. It is some variation on this specific thought that we want to get in touch with. It can be helpful to talk to Jesus or to think of him or the Holy Spirit or some other nonjudgmental presence as there beside us, looking with us as we look to uncover our selfish self. We can describe how we are feeling and what it is that we believe is there, acknowledging the guilt that would have to be associated with such egocentric thinking, or we can simply say, \"Help.\" The words are not important. What matters is that we do not attempt to look within on our own, for we are sure to frighten, even terrorize ourselves. Allowing \"the light of true forgiveness to shine upon our guilt\" is just a more poetic way of saying we are no longer judging ourselves for the decision to see our own needs as coming first. Notice that this says nothing about stopping these thoughts or denying we still feel we have such needs, but speaks only of learning to acknowledge them and the feelings that accompany them without condemning ourselves for holding on to them. This is our part in the looking within process, as we allow what we uncover to be released and healed. And what awaits us, but which is not our responsibility to produce, is the peace and the love that are also within, but have been hidden under the layers of guilt we have placed there to keep the love concealed. So the problem, the solution, and the goal of the process all lie within our own mind. But there will be no hope of any resolution until we learn to look there rather than outside ourselves. And this comes with both willingness and practice over time. For the desire to blame the world and the resistance to looking within are great--in fact, they are the same obstacle. But when we choose a different Teacher within, the world that we see without will be transformed from a place of hatred and attack to a place of forgiveness and love (T-12.VII.5,12)."

    "text_input": "Q #475: I hear so much about the power of tithing 10% of earned money as a way of undoing a lack or scarcity consciousness, especially when it seems one can't afford to, as an act of faith that abundance is my natural position. What thoughts can you give on this?",
    "output": "From the point of view of A Course in Miracles, this is a confusion of form and content, although there is nothing wrong in tithing if that is what you choose to do. The Course's focus is always on changing the content in our minds, because that is the cause of our problems. Thus, a feeling of scarcity, lack, or need comes from our guilt over having rejected our true abundance-- our Identity as part of the Wholeness of God. \"Without guilt there is no scarcity. The sinless have no needs\" (S-1.II.3:5-6). Therefore, the undoing of feelings of scarcity can occur only by our acceptance of the Atonement, the principle stating that the separation from God could not and therefore did not happen. And that acceptance is reflected in our choosing to see our interests as the same as everyone else's, which means looking non-judgmentally at the expressions in our lives of the opposite: competitiveness, rivalry, one or the other thinking, and all the forms of specialness that reinforce our sense of being separate from one another. Sacrifice is not necessary, nor is it considered helpful according to the Course. \"Sacrifice is a notion totally unknown to God\" (T-3.I.4:1), a principle with which biblical and other religious traditions obviously would strongly disagree. \"Only you can deprive yourself of anything. Do not oppose this realization, for it is truly the beginning of the dawn of light\" (T-11.IV.4:1-2). Since we ourselves are responsible for our feelings of deprivation, we ourselves are the only ones who can heal that, by looking within at our decision to withhold love and be separate from Jesus or the Holy Spirit, and then asking Their help to reverse that decision through the practice of forgiveness in our relationships. This is entirely a matter of the content in our minds, not behavior. You might wish to look at the following paragraphs that pertain to scarcity and abundance: T-4.IV.3; T-4.II.6-7."

    "text_input": "Q #476: Are drugs like marijuana just neutral miscreations of the ego that I can now use for a holy purpose, or is this just another ego trap to make me \"think\" I am getting a deeper understanding of A Course in Miracles, which I seem to do when I smoke marijuana? Are the effects of any drug all in your mind, and if so, which mind? Or are they all in the brain? When we alter our brains with some form of magic, what happens? I deeply appreciate the insight I \"seem\" to have on this particular drug but I am not thrilled with the idea of using magic in order to access this insight, especially in a country where this particular form of magic is illegal. Where am I \"going\" and how can I get there without magic?",
    "output": "You can simplify your dilemma if you think of the mind as a puppeteer and the brain as the puppet. A puppet does, and can only do, what the puppeteer makes it do. It has no ability to act or react on its own. Similarly, a computer is limited to what it is programmed to do. The Course teaches that the brain (as part of the body) does only what it is directed to do by the mind. Further, the entire body is just a projection of the mind and never leaves its source as an idea in the mind, despite our experience that our bodies seem to have a life of their own. That is extremely hard for us to grasp and even harder to accept; but when you understand the full thought system of the ego and its dynamics, then it begins to make sense. Remember, the ego never wants us to get back in touch with our identities as decision-making minds outside time and space, and so it has set up an elaborate system of defenses that constantly reinforce our belief that we are autonomous physical organisms affected by forces outside us. We are no longer in touch with ourselves as decision-making minds, which is why Jesus has so many exercises in his workbook designed to train us to regain that awareness of ourselves. Thus, if drugs or any other outside substance affect you, it is only because your mind has chosen to dissociate itself from its identity as a mind and believe instead that it is a body/brain complex in a physical universe governed by laws of physics, chemistry, etc. \"Special agents seem to be ministering to him, yet they but give form to his own choice. He chooses them in order to bring tangible form to his desires. And it is this they do and nothing else\" (M-5.II.2:8-10). This instructive statement comes from a section in the manual on sickness and healing, but it can be applied to your situation as well. You might wish to read that whole section. The point of Jesus' teaching there, as elsewhere, is that we are continually reversing the proper sequence of cause and effect, meaning we think the cause of our experience is something of the world or the body, when it is the exact opposite. All bodily states and conditions are the effect of a decision made in our minds (the cause) to have that experience. (Purpose is key to understanding this--the mind's decision to reinforce its belief in separation or undo that belief.) Therefore, by doing what Jesus directs us to do in the text and workbook, we will gradually get cause and effect back in their proper sequence, and consequently will have less and less need for magic. We will not have to work so hard at understanding and practicing the Course, as we will be experiencing it from within. Questions #124 and #246 may shed additional light for you on these issues."

    "text_input": "Q #477: I am having trouble accepting that Jesus does not care, or is unwilling to help, with everyday problems and issues in my life. I know this represents the bottom rungs of the ladder of prayer, but that seems to be where I am. In reading Absence From Felicity, I am excited about some of the specific help Jesus gave Helen Schucman and Bill Thetford with personal issues. Isn't Jesus also instructing me to incorporate these revelations into my own life when they seem to fit? For example, recently I could not find three important keys I had lost. Occasionally, I found myself saying, \"Jesus, where are those keys?\" Then I found what I considered a gold mine on page 230 in Absence From Felicity (second edition), where Jesus told Helen, \"Prayer can be very specific in little matters.\" Just before I fell asleep that night, Jesus told me where the keys were. I found them the next morning in a purse I hadn't used in a while. How can Jesus not care about these worldly things when I seem repeatedly to get answers like this? Was Helen's relationship with Jesus more \"special\" than mine?",
    "output": "Jesus' help is always available to us at the level we are willing to accept it. It is only our own guilt and fear that keeps us in a state of upset, seemingly triggered by external situations. So, by all means, continue to ask Jesus for help with the little things if that is what you feel you are needing right now. It is not simply that Jesus does not care about our everyday concerns. Rather, he understands what we do not yet understand--that these little problems are not really the problem. What would be most helpful then is if, while asking Jesus for the specific help, we can keep a \"split mind\" about it, that is, acknowledge that we know at another level that the specific problem is not what we are really upset about. In fact, our minds have generated the specific problems to avoid getting in touch with the real problem. One of the clearest statements of the nature of the relationship between problems in the world and the one problem in our mind can be found in the workbook lesson, \"Let me recognize the problem so it can be solved\" (W-pI.79). So, in the end, it would not be at all helpful if Jesus encouraged us to see him simply as a caregiver who helps our everyday lives run a little smoother. He's inviting us to wake up to our reality as spirit, not to get more cozy and comfortable in our dream of denial as bodies. But while we still need to learn to trust him and to undo some of the more fearful images we may hold of him as a critical and punishing judge, it can be helpful to see his love taking the form of help that we are ready to accept, as you are experiencing. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. But this is not really a personal intervention on Jesus' part, as the passages you refer to in Absence from Felicity may seem to suggest at a first reading. You may wish to read a discussion later in the book (chapter 17, pp. 455,465 second edition) on the nature of Jesus' help in the world, which makes it clear that it is our own minds that give form to his abstract love. And when we understand that, it becomes apparent that Jesus can have no favorites. His love, to be truly love, must shine on all of us equally."

    "text_input": "Q #478: What exactly is the Will of God, and is the reason we don't get what we want because it is against His Will?",
    "output": "As defined in the Glossary-Index by Kenneth Wapnick, the Will of God is \"the expression of God's being.\" Because the Son is united with the Father, the Sonship shares one Will with God. In truth there is no opposition to the Will of God, because the Son cannot be separated from the Father. However, in our illusory experience of separation we have made up a seemingly separate will that wants a myriad of things, all of which only reflect the choice to be separate. When we identify with the ego by choosing separation, we do get what we want; i.e., separation. This choice is behind all the special relationships with people, things, and experiences, which we seek as substitutes for God: \"Every special relationship you have made is a substitute for God's Will, and glorifies yours instead of His because of the illusion that they are different\" (T-17.IV.2:7). In A Course in Miracles, Jesus tells us that we do not really know what we want, and what we think we want does not bring us peace or happiness: \"...ask not of yourself what you need, for you do not know, and your advice to yourself will hurt you. For what you think you need will merely serve to tighten up your world against the light, and render you unwilling to question the value that this world can really hold for you\" (T- 13.VII.11:5-6). This world holds no value, and everything we seek in it brings us pain. The very desire for things in this world in itself brings us pain because, as you mention, we often do not get what we think we want. We are then left with feelings of deprivation, frustration, resentment, jealousy, etc. More significantly, the desire for substitutes for God results in guilt, which we then project onto Him, interpreting the fact that we did not get what we want as a punishment for choosing not to identify with the Will of God: \"The projection of the ego makes it appear as if God's Will is outside yourself, and therefore not yours. In this interpretation it seems possible for God's Will and yours to conflict. God, then, may seem to demand of you what you do not want to give, and thus deprive you of what you want\" (T-11.I.9:1-3). It is very important to recognize that the source of all pain is the choice to separate ourselves from God's Will, thus denying our true identity. The emptiness caused by this denial impels us to seek to fill the void with the things we think will make us happy. They won't. We will find peace and happiness only when we accept the one Will we share with God: \"There is no peace except the peace of God, because He has one Son who cannot make a world in opposition to God's Will and to his own, which is the same as His\" (W-pI.200.7:1)."

Helen, the scribe, heard only one Voice throughout the dictation. But as the Course itself says, \"Helpers are given you in many forms, although upon the altar they are one.

    "text_input": "Q #480: If nothing really happens at the level of form or to bodies, but rather at the level of mind, then why is it even necessary to interact with other bodies? Can't a person simply forgive other minds from the comfort of their home? Couldn't a person be a hermit and still perform miracles?",
    "output": "It depends on whether the purpose of staying at home or becoming a hermit is inspired by the ego or the Holy Spirit. The point of our study and practice of A Course in Miracles is to learn that we are never interacting with bodies; it just appears that way because that is what we (as minds) want to be the truth. The body is a projection of the mind--an idea in the mind that never leaves its source in the mind, just as the world is \"the witness to your state of mind, the outside picture of an inward condition\" (T-21.in.1:5). Although the Holy Spirit could certainly guide one to be a hermit; but to speak of the comfort of home and being a hermit, if the intent is ego based, is very much about form. It sounds as if it is a way of interacting with your own body to avoid the hassles and complications of dealing with other bodies. And that sounds like a trick of the ego, a way to keep form real while appearing not to. The danger in this is that it can easily lead to a denial of your experience, which Jesus cautions us about: \"The body is merely part of your experience in the physical world. Its abilities can be and frequently are overevaluated. However, it is almost impossible to deny its existence in this world. Those who do so are engaging in a particularly unworthy form of denial\" (T- 2.IV.3:8-11). The method Jesus uses to help us get beyond the body and the level of form is to first become aware of how seriously we take the body--how thoroughly our lives are based on satisfying its psychological and physical needs--and then to ask for help to learn how to take it less seriously. And this is done in the context of our interactions with our own bodies as well as the bodies of others. Were it not for these interactions, which evoke all kinds of reactions in us, it would be just about impossible for us to get in touch with the choices we are making in our minds, and those choices are the basis of miracles."

    "text_input": "Q #481: Is it possible that I can hold a grievance against someone who would not be holding grievances against me? The extreme example right now would be Jesus: I obviously have not forgiven him yet and he loves me unconditionally; so is it possible that in this world I have hatred for someone and that person could have nothing really specific against me?",
    "output": "Yes, it is entirely possible. That is the importance of remembering that relationships are only about what goes on in our minds. The ego cannot survive without grievances and hatred, so if you still identify with the ego thought system, you will find reasons to justify a grievance against another person, even if you have to make them up. And of course that has nothing to do with the other person. It has to do only with your belief (usually unconscious) that you are a guilty sinner and deserve to be punished. If you turn to the ego instead of Jesus to help you deal with that awful situation in your mind, you will be directed to project your guilt in order that you be free of it; and then you will quickly find fault with another person. You will have blocked from your awareness this dynamic of denial and projection and therefore will not realize that you are seeing your own guilt in another. As A Course in Miracles states: \"Only the self-accused condemn... You never hate your brother for his sins, but only for your own. Whatever form his sins appear to take, it but obscures the fact that you believe them to be yours, and therefore meriting a \"just\" attack\" (T-31.III.1:1,5-6). The lure of this dynamic is the ego's guarantee that it will prove our own innocence. That is the whole point of projection, and that is why we find it almost impossible to let go of grievances. Following the ego's teachings, I believe that if you are guilty, I must be innocent, because the ego's system is ruled by the principle of one or the other. Our salvation thus depends on seeing others as guilty. The other person may be holding absolutely nothing against you, but if there is still guilt in your mind, you will have an overpowering need to find something to hate in that person. That is why Jesus is an extreme example. He has no guilt and therefore he cannot hate anyone. That means our not forgiving him has no effect on him. But yet we continue try to perceive him as guilty of something--our own guilt demands this. His role as our teacher, however, is to help us look at the self-accusation of sin in our minds and learn that it is all made up--it is not based on fact, because it is impossible to attack God. The belief in sin testifies to the opposite--that God has been attacked, and we ought to feel good and guilty about it (original sin, as this is known in biblical traditions). If you accept what Jesus is teaching you in the Course, you will become free of any sense of sinfulness and therefore guilt, and so you will not have a need to hate and attack others, regardless of what their behavior may be. You will no longer have a need for grievances. \"The innocent release in gratitude for their own release. And what they see upholds their freedom from imprisonment and death. Open your mind to change, and there will be no ancient penalty exacted from your brother or yourself. For God has said there is no sacrifice that can be asked; there is no sacrifice that can be made\" (T-31.III.7)."

    "text_input": "Q #482: What does the Introduction to A Course in Miracles mean by \"It is a required Course?\" Isn't the Course supposed to be just one of the \"ways\" to regain truth?",
    "output": "The specific context for this phrase is related in Absence from Felicity: The Story of Helen Schucman and Her Scribing of A Course in Miracles by Kenneth Wapnick. In a somewhat humorous dialogue between Helen and Jesus, Helen expresses some resistance to the Course by calling it an \"elective.\" Jesus responds that no, \"it's a definite requirement\" in both form and content for Helen (p. 215, second edition). What is universally required is the content of the Course's teaching, not the form. The many \"ways\" or paths to truth are different forms. Everyone will ultimately accept the truth and return to God. There is nothing but the truth, and nowhere else to go but to our true home in Heaven. However, how we get there may vary. The manual offers a helpful clarification: \"There is a course for every teacher of God. The form of the course varies greatly. So do the particular teaching aids involved. But the content of the course never changes. Its central theme is always, \"God's Son is guiltless, and in his innocence is his salvation... This is a manual for a special curriculum, intended for teachers of a special form of the universal course. There are many thousands of other forms, all with the same outcome\" (M-1.3:1-5; 4:1-2). It may be helpful to remember that the different forms do not necessarily refer to what are usually considered to be religions or spiritual paths. As stated in the manual, there is only one requirement for someone to embark on the path to truth: \"... somehow, somewhere he has made a deliberate choice in which he did not see his interests as apart from someone else's\" (M-1.1:2)."

    "text_input": "Q #483: In The Most Commonly Asked Questions About A Course in Miracles you said that it would be an expression of specialness if we thought ourselves superior to be a student of a \"sophisticated book that comes from Jesus himself.\" But I feel very proud and good about myself that I have been working through such a difficult thought system; I feel very brave. What do you think?",
    "output": "That's fine, as long as you do not think you are better than others who accept a different spirituality, or none. \"Comparison must be an ego device, for love makes none. Specialness always makes comparisons\" (T-24.II.1:1-2). It is quite contradictory to the whole message of the Course--the Son of God is one--to judge oneself superior to another for any reason whatsoever. Then, too, it is rather humbling when you realize that Jesus is saying in a number of different ways throughout the Course that we are here (or at least we think we are here in this world) because we attacked Love and banished it from our minds, and then we made up our own version of love as a substitute. He addresses us as little children, and even babies at times, in essence telling us that we are just beginning to take our first steps on the path of salvation. That is humbling indeed--nothing to brag about. But we can indeed be grateful that we have accepted a loving teacher who gently and patiently teaches us how to recognize our mistakes and then choose again: \"If you want to be like me I will help you, knowing that we are alike. If you want to be different, I will wait until you change your mind. I can teach you, but only you can choose to listen to my teaching (T-8.IV.6:3-5)."

    "text_input": "Q #484: My question is regarding jury duty. Can a serious student of A Course in Miracles serve on a jury and be true to the principles taught in the Course? The use of active judgment regarding another is required in being a juror, and the effect of one's judgment can have consequences to the accused--and to ourselves, being one with the accused. I wonder if serving on a jury would represent a conflict of Course principles in terms of a \"right-minded\" approach to the illusion of the world we live in. Should a Course student who believes in forgiveness, and sees his brother as himself, seek to be a conscientious objector to serving as a juror?",
    "output": "Variations on your question are among the most frequently asked ones about practicing the Course (see Question 31 in The Most Commonly Asked Questions about A Course in Miracles, by Gloria and Kenneth Wapnick). Although the concerns you raise seem very legitimate, they come from a common confusion that most students make as they attempt to apply the Course's principles to their lives--the confusion of form and content (e.g., T-14.X.7,8; T-23.II.16:5). The Course never takes a position one way or another on form, that is, on specific activities or behaviors. Jesus is only ever concerned with content--whether our mind is listening to the voice of the ego or the Voice for God. And that is the distinction between coming from a place of anger and attack or a place of gentleness and peace in your mind. Sometimes one of the most helpful classrooms for learning the Holy Spirit's lessons of forgiveness is one in which the ground rules seem most blatantly to represent the ego's arena of judgment and guilt. For whatever the ego has made for separation and attack, the Holy Spirit can use for healing (T- 25.VI.4:1). A courtroom can be transformed in your mind from a place of condemnation and punishment to one of genuine compassion and recognition of shared interests, regardless of the specific verdict--guilty or not guilty--that the jury, including yourself, delivers. How is this possible? The key, as already noted, is to focus on the content of your mind and not the specific form you are participating in. And this is usually a process in which you first become aware of all the ego judgments that the situation is bringing up for you--your reactions to the defendant, the plaintiff, their lawyers, the judge, your fellow jurors--there are just so many opportunities to pass judgments here! And your ego, very cleverly, in the name of the Course, would have encouraged you to avoid jury duty so as to avoid engaging in the \"forbidden\" activity of judging a fellow man or woman. But we all do it all the time, wherever we seem to find ourselves. There is no hierarchy within the illusion (T-23.II.2:3)--no ego judgment is worse than another for all lead to the same unhappy experience of separation. It is also very helpful to distinguish between judgment as condemnation and judgment simply as discernment. To evaluate the facts and circumstances of a case and to draw conclusions about whether a defendant has in fact done what he or she has been accused of need not involve condemnation. To find someone \"guilty\" in a court of law is simply to conclude that the person is responsible for the charges brought against him or her. Any interpretation about the unworthiness and sinfulness of that individual as a function of the decision is the gratuitous addition of the ego. Jesus provides a good demonstration of the use of judgment as discernment when he speaks of the ego. Specifically, he says, \"Judgment, like any other defense, can be used to attack or protect; to hurt or to heal. The ego should be brought to judgment and found wanting there\" (T-4.IV.8:7- 8). This is simply a statement of fact and should not be read as a a condemnation of the ego-- why would Jesus condemn an illusory thought that he knows has no power? The fact that certain actions may have consequences in the world, e.g., breaking the law leads to sentencing to jail or prison time or to a monetary fine, need not be regarded as punishment. It is the purpose that we give to the consequence in our own minds that determines whether we are reinforcing a belief in separate or shared interests, not only with the convicted individual, but with all our brothers and sisters. And the way we are able to come from a place of shared rather than separate interests is once again to acknowledge any feelings of anger and condemnation that we may be harboring towards the convicted person, which would naturally lead to a desire to seek revenge and to punish. Being honest with ourselves about our ego reactions allows us to ask for help to see both ourselves and the ones we are projecting our own guilt onto in a different light. When we have released our own investment in any specific outcome, we can then become a presence in the courtroom for another way of judging that recognizes everything any of us ever does as either an extension of love or a call for it (T-12.I)."

    "text_input": "Q #486: Is turning away from the ego equivalent to turning toward the Holy Spirit? I ask this because I can't say that I really know what the Holy Spirit is or how to recognize it. But I do want to turn to the Holy Spirit as my teacher. Yet I wonder if my lack of clarity is really a lack of willingness. Am I unwilling to acknowledge the Holy Spirit? Or am I already turning to the Holy Spirit as I practice forgiveness in my mind and withdraw my investment from the world of guilt and attack?",
    "output": "If you truly turn from the ego thought system, yes, you would be turning to the Holy Spirit. There is no other direction toward which to turn: \"There are two teachers only, who point in different ways. And you will go along the way your chosen teacher leads. There are but two directions you can take, while time remains and choice is meaningful\" (T-26.V.1:7-9). The process of forgiveness begins with the willingness to look differently at the thoughts, feelings, and judgments we have in all the relationships and experiences in our lives. This willingness reflects a choice in the mind to listen to the Holy Spirit. We cannot know nor understand what the Holy Spirit will show us when we let go of our judgment. That is not our responsibility. As A Course in Miracles tells us many times and in many ways: \"Forgiveness is the only function meaningful in time. It is the means the Holy Spirit uses to translate specialness from sin into salvation\" (T-25.VI.5:3-4). It is in recognizing the true nature and purpose of our unforgiveness that we invite the Holy Spirit's reinterpretation of our misperceptions, whether or not we know Who He is. The ego would not have us recognize nor question our judgments. The questioning then, is what tells us that a choice has been made to listen to a different interpretation of what we experience. That is the evidence we are looking for, and it is how we know that what Jesus tells us in A Course in Miracles is true."

    "text_input": "Q #487: In your audio set \"Form vs. Content: Sex and Money,\" you state that when we have issues with money--the lack of or an obsession with it--that there is usually someone in our past that needs forgiveness. I am confused here because I thought we always dealt in the present and not in the past. How do we go about forgiving the past? Do we just simply turn it over to the Holy Spirit and let a healing take place and in so doing let go of any attachment to the past, any anger and resentment?",
    "output": "We almost always think that our problems, issues, and conditions are caused by someone or something outside ourselves--something that happened in the past, whether that is ten minutes ago or ten years ago, or the beginning of time. \"I am the thing you made of me, and as you look on me, you stand condemned because of what I am\" (T-31.V.5:3). That is our theme song as egos, even though it may not be in our awareness; so delving under the surface a bit often reveals the culprit--the one we are blaming for our present plight. Examples abound of people who believe they are not worthy of wealth, and that self-image usually has a connection to a parent or some other person who had a formative influence in their lives--school, church/temple, etc. An obsessive need to amass a fortune is a symbol of something else--it could be way of dealing with an agonizing, painful sense of spiritual or psychological poverty, which, again, undoubtedly is being blamed on some figure from the past. If someone comes to mind when you think about money issues, then all you need to do is ask for help to recognize that you have projected your own guilt onto this person and are falsely accusing him/her of being the cause of your current problems. If there is blame, then the relationship is very much alive in your mind, even though it outwardly appears to be a thing of the past. That is all Jesus is ever referring to when he teaches us about relationships--it is always about what is going on in our minds, not what seems to be going on between two bodies. The ego uses the past to reinforce our sense of victimization--how can we change what is already over? Jesus corrects this by teaching us that time is just part of the ego's strategy to limit us and our ability to forgive. Both blame (projecting our guilt) and forgiveness are entirely activities or dynamics in our minds, and therefore time is irrelevant. The body, too, is simply a smokescreen thrown up by the ego to thwart and complicate an otherwise simple, clear process. Now it is not necessary to pinpoint the specific person or persons in the past whom we are holding responsible for our present condition. It may be helpful, but that insight alone is not forgiveness. It is sufficient to assume that we are blaming someone, and that that same guilt is being projected onto someone currently in our lives; so if we were able to completely forgive that person in the present, then everyone else we have held grievances against would be forgiven as well. Finally, it is important to notice that this is all about problems and issues with money. One can be perfectly at peace with little or no money, or with billions of dollars. The peace of God, our natural inheritance, is not conditional on our financial status, or anything else that has to do with the world or the body."

    "text_input": "Q #488: From what you have said in previous answers, I understand that the world of form may or may not change for the better when you begin to give up belief in the illusion and choose the Holy Spirit as your teacher. But in #273 you state:  \"Since hell is defined as the absence of God, the world becomes hell in our experience; not a symbolic expression of it. A Course in Miracles is very clear that God cannot be found in this world of form. However, when an individual chooses to identify with the part of the mind that holds the memory of God, the world becomes a reflection of that choice, and is no longer perceived as hell: 'The world becomes a place of joy, abundance, charity and endless giving. It is now so like to Heaven that it quickly is transformed into the light that it reflects'\" (W- pII.249.1:5-6).  So, are you saying that when you choose the Holy Spirit as your teacher the \"world of form\" will be this place of joy, abundance and so on? Or are you referring to the world as the \"real\" world that has nothing to do with form? How do I put into practice the idea of seeing everything outside of me as a reflection of God?",
    "output": "The answer to your question lies in understanding one of the most important principles of the Course's teaching: \"There is no world apart from what you wish, and herein lies your ultimate release. Change but your mind on what you want to see, and all the world must change accordingly. Ideas leave not their source\" (W-pI.132.5:1-3). \"What you wish\" is either the ego's thought system or the Holy Spirit's. Thinking with the ego makes our seeming existence in the world hell in our perception, because we have chosen against God. Thinking with the Holy Spirit makes it like Heaven in our perception, as stated in the passage you quote. These are the \"ideas\" that do not leave their source in the mind. The world of form is perceived and experienced according to one of these two thought systems. When we change our mind from the ego's thought of separation to the Holy Spirit's thought that the separation is not real, our perception changes. This results in a change in our experience of the world of form, but not necessarily a change in the form itself. What was perceived as a place of conflict, hatred, and pain, becomes a place of beauty, joy, and peace, in our perception. For example; where others were judged as vicious sinners, they are now seen without judgment as mistaken brothers calling for love. This also explains why two people may be in the same situation in form, yet experience or perceive it in very different ways. From the ego's perspective, adverse circumstances are always perceived as unjust victimization (hell). The Holy Spirit's perception, on the other hand, tells us that no matter how apparently catastrophic our situation may be, it cannot take away our peace (\"like to Heaven\"). The important difference emphasized in Question #273 is that hell does not actually exist; Heaven does. The change in perception takes place through the process of forgiveness, whereby our judgments are recognized and released to the Holy Spirit to be transformed. Only this is what we need to practice, and only this will change our experience of the world of form. The Holy Spirit's perception replaces ours, once we have done our part. We are not the ones who generate a new perception. Because the Holy Spirit is the symbol for the part of our minds that holds the memory of God's Love, when we choose His thought system it is this Love that is reflected in the love and beauty that is perceived in others and the world. It is perceived equally in everyone without exception, not just in those whom we love and see as \"innocent\" by the ego's standards. And yes, seeing only with the eyes of the Holy Spirit's perception is the real world's vision: \"Can you imagine how beautiful those you forgive will look to you?... you will see the Son of God. You will behold the beauty the Holy Spirit loves to look upon, and which He thanks the Father for. He was created to see this for you, until you learned to see it for yourself\" (T- 17.II.1:1,6-8)."

    "output": "It is important to keep in mind when pondering these kinds of questions that we are talking about a process that is really illusory. We believe that time is real and meaningful and that our lives as individuals are real and meaningful, so Jesus must talk to us using words and concepts that correspond to those beliefs since we would not understand any other language. But he is using that terminology to help us correct our erroneous beliefs and accept his thought system instead. Jesus speaks of our lives in terms of scripts that we are living out because that is a concept we can understand, but not because there are scripts in reality. Within this framework, then, we can say that we review only one script at a given time, in order to prevent an overloading of our circuits--seeing all scripts all at once would cause us to blow a fuse, so to speak. Remember, too, that a single lifetime could include multiple scripts. This is more understandable if you view time as holographic rather than linear; that is, all we are ever doing is reinforcing our choice to believe the ego, or choosing against that and accepting what Jesus is teaching us instead. The specific ways in which we express these beliefs are our scripts. And as we all know, we can change our minds several times a minute! Thus, there are many, many scripts. But there is one in which we deny our denial of the truth once and for all; our forgiveness is total and our minds are totally without guilt. Since, again, time is not linear, that choice is always open to us. We can always, at any instant, choose that script; then all other scripts would disappear. We would realize the illusory nature of all scripts, and we would identify wholly and only with the love and peace of Jesus. Kenneth has written at length about this intriguing topic, and has also given workshops on it, the last now one of our audio-tape publications, \"The Time Machine.\" His book is called A Vast Illusion: Time According to A Course in Miracles. And there is also a helpful section called \"The Purpose of the World of Time and Space\" in Chapter 3 of The Message of A Course in Miracles, Vol. One. Jesus reminds us, though, that we in this world cannot understand what he tells us about time: \"There is no need to further clarify what no one in the world can understand ... Now we have work to do, for those in time can speak of things beyond, and listen to words which explain what is to come is past already. Yet what meaning can the words convey to those who count the hours still, and rise and work and go to sleep by them?\" (W-pI.169.10:1,3-4). He always comes back to the practical: forgiveness."

If accessing the right mind requires that we are first aware that another mind exists, and second that we understand the defenses the ego puts up in order to insure that we don't go there, what mind was I identifying with when I made the decision to begin to read and study A Course in Miracles? I understand now that during all my years of learning ego management skills, that I was probably always coming from the ego's thought system, so how did my ego mind ever choose to pick up a book that could be the undoing of it? When we come to the conclusion \"there has to be another way\" is the ego obliged to get out of the way? Please enlighten me.",
    "output": "First, approaching the mind in terms of three parts certainly corresponds to the way Jesus speaks of it in the Course, but we need to remember as well that he is describing a process that in the end is illusory. So we should not regard this description of the separated (therefore illusory) mind and its dynamics as a blueprint or schematic for an actual mind that exists in reality. It should be regarded more as a teaching aid, and all teaching aids, while serving a useful purpose, have limits. So compartmentalizing the mind in this fashion is a way of helping us undo the mistaken way in which we have thought about ourselves, as well as helping us understand why we function in the world the way we do. Perhaps the key point in answering your question is Jesus' reassurance that we are not wholly insane and that there is a limit on our ability to miscreate (T-2.III.3:3). Moreover, he tells us that \"tolerance for pain may be high, but it is not without limit. Eventually everyone begins to recognize, however dimly, that there must be a better way\" (T-2.III.3:5-6). The decision maker can continually uphold its decision to conceal the Holy Spirit's thought system and its own decision-making capacity, but that does not mean that there no longer is a right mind or a decision maker. They are just concealed, and well concealed, as we all can attest to. Nevertheless, the decision maker is always functioning as a decision maker, while trying to pretend that it is not. Furthermore, continuing to speak in anthropomorphic terms, the ego always senses a threat to its existence, as would anyone involved in faking something. And therefore somewhere in our minds there would be the thought that things aren't what they appear to be, and we are not what we appear to be. For most people it seems, that thought does not surface until something horrendous happens, or they reach a stage where they throw up their hands in despair or frustration in a way they never have before. The motivation, again, is a level of pain that becomes intolerable. (Obviously, many people just go right back into the ego thought system for a solution.) It is not the ego, though, that does this--remember, the ego is just a belief that the decision maker has accepted. So it is as if the decision maker responds to its own dimly perceived misgivings about the beliefs it has identified with. And in that instant, it has disidentified with the ego and allowed itself to see just a glimmer of the light beaming from the right mind. The expression of that shift may take any number of forms, one of which would be the appearance in one's life of A Course in Miracles. But it could be anything that would help heal the mind of its belief that separation from God is a reality."

    "text_input": "Q #491: A Course in Miracles says I must choose between teachers: the Holy Spirit or the ego. I choose the Holy Spirit, but how do I actually do this? Since I don't know what anything means, how do I know when the Holy Spirit is teaching me?",
    "output": "We choose the Holy Spirit by being willing to look honestly at our attack thoughts and judgments, with willingness to let Him transform them. This requires that we recognize the defenses we employ to maintain our fierce attachment to our belief in the separation and the reality of the world and the body. Although the Course tells us we do not really know what anything means, we think we do know. We have agreed with the ego that our attacks, along with our feelings of anger, resentment, and victimization are justified. We believe in our identity as bodies. We believe that situations that are external to the mind can have an effect on us by taking away our peace. Questioning these beliefs and our interpretation of our experiences, allowing that perhaps we are wrong, invites the Holy Spirit to offer His interpretation. This new interpretation is the forgiveness process. We accept His teaching with every application of forgiveness in our relationships, and the events of our lives. The first step is to pay attention to any upsetting feeling, acknowledging that its true source is a choice in the mind to be separate, and not whatever external situation seems to have caused the upset. Because we are so fiercely attached to our beliefs it is not easy to do this. Fortunately, Jesus tells us we do not have to do it perfectly: \"Your willingness need not be perfect, because His [Holy Spirit] is\" (T-11.II.6:6). However haltingly you may take the first step in questioning your interpretation of your relationships and experiences, it is enough to allow the Holy Spirit to enter. We are asked only to do our part: \"Call not upon the ego for anything; it is only this that you need do. The Holy Spirit will, of Himself, fill every mind that so makes room for Him\" (T- 14.XI.13:5-6)."

    "text_input": "Q #492: My question has to do with forgiving Jesus. And I realize that I have much forgiveness of him to work through. I was thinking the other day that I never saw a smiling Jesus in any picture. Is this one of the ways that the world has promulgated this image of him: by him always looking stern and unhappy? Why is he never smiling?",
    "output": "You may find several \"smiling Jesus\" images on the Internet. In \"Google,\" key in \"smiling Jesus\" and click on images. Also please refer to #265 for more information relating to Jesus as a symbol in form. However, more important than the imagined images of Jesus smiling or not is your recognition of the need to forgive him. This is especially worthy of your attention. In A Course in Miracles, Jesus himself tells us: \"Forgive me, then, today. And you will know you have forgiven me if you behold your brother in the light of holiness. He cannot be less holy than can I, and you can not be holier than he\" (W-pII.288.2:1-3). In just this short passage we find the entire circle of projection. The guilt we feel for having chosen to believe the thought of separation is projected on to everyone else in our lives, in some form or other. On an even deeper level, guilt for being unwilling to accept the Atonement principle (which is that separation is not possible) is projected on to Jesus, who represents the part of our minds that does accept the Atonement. It is understandable then that Jesus, and anyone else we may choose to attack would be perceived negatively. Forgiveness of Jesus, along with all our brothers, begins with the recognition that they are not the ones who are responsible for our choice to believe in the separation. As the Course tells us, they did nothing: \" ... forgive the Son of God for what he did not do\" (T-17.III.1:5). Willingness to take responsibility for our choice releases Jesus and our brothers from our projections, which frees us to see them and ourselves in a different light. Though the difference is actually a shift to more quietness in the mind, it may be symbolized in a smile as so beautifully expressed in this prayer in the workbook addressed to the Father: \"I am he on whom You smile in love and tenderness so dear and deep and still the universe smiles back on You, and shares Your Holiness\" (W-pII.341.1:2). It is difficult to imagine Jesus or ourselves saying this with a stern, unhappy expression."

    "text_input": "Q #493: We have a person who comes to our meetings who is very hostile and angry. It is obvious that she has mental problems. She has been asked to leave one ACIM group and has been forcibly removed from an AA meeting by the police. We have tried to think of her as our greatest teacher and welcome her. No one tries to provoke her and rarely does anyone argue with her. It just elevates the situation. We let her have her say and say thank you and go on with the meeting. Rarely can anyone follow her train of thought. The other week, she was very angry and started yelling at the group. I had this vision of a three-year-old pulling a temper tantrum. I was not angry as I would not be angry at a three-year-old. I would however leave the room or remove the child. I don't believe spiritual is being a doormat and saying it's okay because that is the way you are and it is all right to treat me like this. I do believe the Course wants us to come from a place of love and not anger. Is it unreasonable to ask for a certain type of decorum from her at the meetings? Would it ever be appropriate according to A Course in Miracles to ask someone to leave if they refused to abide by the rules?",
    "output": "This type of situation is more common than not in groups, and it is one that has led to distortions and misinterpretations of Course teachings. Yes, it is entirely in keeping with the spirit and message of A Course in Miracles to ask someone to leave a group. Depending on one's inner guidance, it can be the only loving thing to do, for all concerned. Your analogy with a three-year-old having a temper tantrum is a good one. It does no good for either the parent or the child to condone that type of behavior; the child needs to know that there are limits and that the parent is in control, however much the behavior signals the opposite. This applies to adults as well. Somewhere deep within our minds we are absolutely terrified that we might be right in thinking that the ego is all there is--that all is chaos and we can never return to our true Home. We desperately want to hear that we are wrong about that. We may not choose to turn in that direction, but there is at least some comfort in knowing we are not caught in a black hole of chaos and despair, that there is a way out if we choose to go in that direction. But the key idea, as you say, is to learn how to stop hurtful, aggressive behavior in a way that is firm and resolute, yet kind. This requires some insight in our own tendencies to project our guilt onto others and then judge them so that we will come out on top--the innocent ones. If that tendency, along with all fear and feelings of victimization can be set aside, if only for an instant, then the way for love to respond has been cleared. And then we can \"step back and let Him lead the way\" (W-pI.155). For a study of compassion as taught in the Course, you can consult our audio album, \"The Compassion of the Miracle,\" and Kenneth's article in the December 2001 issue of The Lighthouse, which addresses this issue in the context of the 9/11 attacks."

    "text_input": "Q #494: Brothers that become not identified with bodies through death, where do they go until they return once again, to have the opportunity to choose correctly?",
    "output": "The apparent death of the body does not necessarily mean that someone has chosen not to identify with it. It is only when the mind chooses to identify fully with the truth of Who we are as God's innocent Son, that identity with the body will be set aside: \"When your body and your ego and your dreams are gone, you will know that you will last forever. Perhaps you think this is accomplished through death, but nothing is accomplished through death, because death is nothing. Everything is accomplished through life, and life is of the mind and in the mind\" (T-6.V-A.1:1-3). Since the mind is not in the body, it does not go anywhere when the body dies. The part of the mind that identified with a particular body for a time continues in its \"mind state\" which, of course, is not a place. The mind does not need a body to choose correctly. In fact, if it truly chooses correctly, it does not need a body at all, since choosing to identify with the body is an incorrect choice in the first place. One of the important goals of A Course in Miracles is to teach us that we are minds, not bodies. The mind is where all the action is; and the only \"action\" is choosing. Since the mind does not need a body to choose, there is no change in the activity of the mind when the body \"dies.\" The body is merely the seeming effect of the mind's mistaken choice to believe the thought of separation is real. The body does nothing. \"The body no more dies than it can feel. It does nothing ... It is nothing\" (T-19.IV-C-5:2-5). For more on this topic, please refer to #68."

    "text_input": "Q #495: I have read and re-read the following passage from the manual of A Course in Miracles about prayer. I still cannot understand what Jesus is trying to say. Can you help?  \"The prayer for things of this world will bring experiences of this world. If the prayer of the heart asks for this, this will be given because this will be received. It is impossible that the prayer of the heart remain unanswered in the perception of the one who asks. If he asks for the impossible, if he wants what does not exist or seeks for illusions in his heart, all this becomes his own. The power of his decision offers it to him as he requests. Herein lie hell and Heaven\" (M- 21.3:1-6)",
    "output": "To speak of the \"prayer of the heart\" is another way of saying \"this is what my mind wants.\" If my prayer (as a decision-making mind identified with the ego) is to prove that I am right and God is wrong--that separation is reality and oneness is illusion--then I will have experiences that will validate that, because that is what I have asked for. And of course this requires that there be a world in which separation can be expressed in innumerable forms-- of victimization, especially. So my perception of suffering, death, conflict, oppression, etc., as real is coming from my secret wish that they be real, in order to fulfill my underlying objective of proving God wrong. My ego then reigns supreme. Herein lies hell! But it is here by my own choice. In this sense there are no \"innocent victims.\" In my wrong mind I want separation to be the truth, so my experience in the world will be that my interests are in conflict with almost everyone else's. I have thus sought for the things of this world and therefore that is what I now experience: separate interests as some form of pain or pleasure. But when my prayer is for the recovery of my memory of my true Self, which embraces all people, then my eyes may still see the same scenes in the world, but my experience of them will be entirely different. To put this in the context of form and content, I will still perceive separate interests in terms of form, but the content in my mind will always be the same, which is that we all share the same interests. I have looked on the \"tiny, mad idea of separation\" and simply smiled at it, judging it as silly and not to be taken seriously. This means that nothing at all can disturb or change my inner peace. I will now see through the eyes of forgiveness. In the words of Lesson 122, I will experience \"a quietness that cannot be disturbed, a gentleness that never can be hurt, a deep, abiding comfort, and a rest so perfect it can never be upset\" (W-pI.122.1:6)--and all this regardless of what is going on in the world."

    "text_input": "Q #496: Does Jesus have a sense of humor?",
    "output": "Yes and no. As one who has accepted the Atonement for himself and is a symbol of the part of the mind that remembers the truth of who we are, Jesus does not need, nor have a sense of humor. He reflects only the love that extends through him. However, as our teacher, this love takes the form that best suits our need. One of those forms is A Course in Miracles, which does indeed have passages that can considered humorous. Part of the definition of humor itself may apply to the Course: \"the ability to perceive, appreciate, or express what is funny, amusing, or ludicrous\" (Webster's Unabridged Dictionary). Since ludicrous is something that is \"laughably absurd\" (Webster's Unabridged Dictionary), it is aptly applied to the separation thought, which Jesus describes as ridiculous in several passages in the Course. Indeed, the very foundation of the Course's metaphysics is set in the context of humor: \"Into eternity, where all is one, there crept a tiny, mad idea, at which the Son of God remembered not to laugh. In his forgetting did the thought become a serious idea, and possible of both accomplishment and real effects. Together, we can laugh them both away, and understand that time cannot intrude upon eternity. It is a joke to think that time can come to circumvent eternity ... \" (T-27.VIII.6:2-5). Thus, Jesus is inviting us to laugh at our absurd belief in separation. In the end, we will see that our journey into seeming darkness and terror was in fact nothing but a silly, laughable mistake. He gives us a somewhat humorous description of fear: \"How weak is fear; how little and how meaningless ... This is your \"enemy,\"-a frightened mouse that would attack the universe. How likely is it that it will succeed? ... Which is the stronger? Is it this tiny mouse or everything that God created? You and your brother are not joined together by this mouse, but by the Will of God. And can a mouse betray whom God has joined? (T-22.V.4:1,3-4,6-9). He who sees how foolish it looks for God's Son, thinking he has destroyed Heaven, to be masquerading as a miserable sinner in a body must indeed smile. However, since we take our insanity very seriously, Jesus is not laughing at us. He is offering a path that leads to where we can laugh at ourselves, and forget our ridiculous belief in sin, guilt, and fear: \"The time has come to laugh at such insane ideas\" (W-pI.190.4:2). Jesus must think we are ready to have a sense of humor."

    "text_input": "Q #497: I am curious about prophecies and their relationship with our \"time\" here--being a review of the master tape, so to speak. Both the Tibetan and the Hopi/Navajo prophecies have paralleled each other for 3,000 years, and end \"soon.\" Since \"time\" is already over, could there be a connection? Are prophecies indicative of having a good memory?",
    "output": "First, let's consider the phenomenon of psychic powers as it is addressed in A Course in Miracles. In answer to the question \"Are 'Psychic' Powers Desirable?\" Jesus explains that they can be of value in demonstrating that \"communication is not limited to the small range of channels the world recognizes\"; yet in the end, \"the only important consideration is how they are used ... to strengthen the ego ... [or as] a great channel of hope and healing in the Holy Spirit's service\" (M-25.2:2; 3:4; 6:5-6). He further, and importantly, points out that to transcend the limits the world places on communication is simply to achieve our natural state--it is nothing special nor is it a special gift from God (2:5,7-8). Prophecy, thus, could be related to the transcendence of the limits most people have on reading the \"script,\" to use one of the Course's metaphors for the ego's span of existence, which amounts to every conceivable form of separation. As part of its strategy to fragment wholeness, to splinter it, divide it, and subdivide it over and over again (T-18.I.4), the ego makes up linear time, so that the one substitution for wholeness appears in our minds as epochs, ages, eras, and even parallel universes, which physicists have been speculating about for a few decades now. (Incidentally, there is nothing in the Course's theory that would preclude the possibility of there being parallel universes.) Whenever we (as decision-making minds) identify with the ego, we automatically perceive time as linear, as going in one direction. But it is not really that way; and somewhere in our minds we know that. We always retain the ability to disregard these arbitrary limits and see several different parts of the script at the same time. Our lives represent the mind's choice to review selected portions of this script, and since this script has been written in its entirety and time is not linear, then prophecy is merely the lifting of the limits on \"seeing\" that we have chosen as part of our bargain with the ego to remain oblivious to this script, and therefore to the real nature of the world of time and space. This lifting of limits does not necessarily mean that one has transcended the ego, and it is not necessarily a spiritual event. It could simply be that the \"prophet\" is viewing time as holographic rather than linear, which we are all capable of doing. (A popular saying is that time is a plot to keep everything from happening all at once!) It is just so hard for us to conceptualize non-linearity, to say nothing of timelessness. But only because to do so would threaten the very foundation of our existence as individuals. In the end, all issues of this nature are inherently illusory since linear time is inherently illusory, despite our experiences to the contrary. The world of time and space is governed entirely by the mind and its choice to use time either to conceal truth or to negate that concealment and then transcend time entirely. The mind is always outside time and space, but it can convince itself that it is not. In a similar vein Jesus tells us, \"You are not sick and cannot die. But you can confuse yourself with things that do\" (T-10.V.8:3-4). The only thing we know for certain is that we can be at peace right now and that forgiveness is the means of removing everything that stands in the way of our being at peace. For further study of time, see Kenneth's book, A Vast Illusion: Time and A Course in Miracles; and his audio or video, \"The Time Machine.\" Question 167 also discusses relevant aspects of this issue."

    "text_input": "Q #498: I have been receiving inner voice/intuition for some time (before studying A Course in Miracles). The information it has given me by gut feelings and actual thoughts/voice that interrupt mine has nearly always been correct. I have tried to get back together with my husband, from whom I have been separated for a while, but his lack of trust and fear keep us apart. The answers I receive seem, feel, and sound as if they are from the Holy Spirit. I am consistently told \"no\" and to have faith. The voice says, \"Would I have lead you to the truth, then lead him away from you now?\" I know that special relationships are the greatest tool of the ego. How can I be certain that the voice is the Holy Spirit, not a trick of the ego?",
    "output": "It is not really possible to comment on individual experiences of hearing the Holy Spirit, such as the one you have shared. As a general rule we can say that issues pertaining to specifics tend to be colored by ego investments that we are not fully aware of, and because of that, our focus ought to be on getting the ego out of the way, rather than on what we are hearing. Helen Schucman, the scribe of the Course, was advised by Jesus: \"You cannot ask, 'What shall I say to him?' and hear God's answer. Rather ask instead, 'Help me to see this brother through the eyes of truth and not of judgment,' and the help of God and all His angels will respond\" (Absence from Felicity, p. 381). Also of interest is the fact that Helen was not always consistent in hearing when it came to specifics. When she was emotionally involved in an issue, she was frequently \"off\" in what she thought she heard: the dates of Bill Thetford's and her husband Louis' deaths, for example. So our emphasis, thus, is on asking for help to let go of any judgments in our minds. Then, in a holy instant in which we are free of fear and judgment and have no investment in the outcome, love will flow through us, and we will do whatever seems best at that moment. We all would love to have specific answers come to us when we are dealing with critical issues, and we would love to have the answers accompanied by the certainty that they have come from the Holy Spirit or Jesus and therefore everything will work out just fine; but the process generally does not work like that--again, because of the many ego factors still concealed in our minds. Finally, the section in the text called \"The Test of Truth\" provides clear and compelling guidelines for discerning whether or not one is in touch with the Holy Spirit. This issue is the topic of Question #43 in our book, The Most Commonly Asked Questions About A Course in Miracles. We quote one portion: \"You have one test, as sure as God, by which to recognize if what you learned is true. [1] If you are wholly free of fear of and kind, and [2] if all those who meet or even think of you share in your perfect peace, then you can be sure that you have learned God's lesson, and not your own\" (T-14.XI.5:1-2). Other students have asked about this as well--in fact it is the second most frequently asked question. We have addressed it in other Questions on this service that you might wish to review: #11, #43, #309, and especially #285."

    "text_input": "Q #499: \"Forgiveness looks and waits and judges not\" What is the meaning of \"waiting\"?",
    "output": "Forgiveness does not demand that anyone, including ourselves, be in any way different at any given time. When someone is perceived to be in a fearful state, forgiveness recognizes the power of the mind to make a different choice and \"waits\" for the other's readiness or willingness to choose differently. Forgiveness is thus patient, in the way the manual describes one of the characteristics of the teacher of God: \"Those who are certain of the outcome can afford to wait, and wait without anxiety. Patience is natural to the teacher of God. All he sees is certain outcome, at a time perhaps unknown to him as yet, but not in doubt. The time will be as right as is the answer\" (M-4.VIII.1:1-4). This applies to oneself as well. Any sense of impatience in achieving the goal of A Course in Miracles, or experiencing the peace of forgiveness, indicates that the ego has been put in charge of the Atonement plan, which means it is no longer truly the Atonement plan. It makes the error real ascribing power to the ego, the exact opposite to the meaning of Atonement. The forgiveness process that Jesus is teaching in the Course is gentle. It invites us to wait, rather than try to fight off resistance, or force ourselves to think or behave in a way for which we are not truly ready. We wait by doing what Jesus tells us we should do: \"Step gently aside, and let healing be done for you ... Focus your mind only on this: ... I need do nothing except not to interfere\" (T- 16.I.3:7,9,12). Our part in the process is very simple; we are asked to look at the ego in operation, recognizing its vicious thoughts and judgments as the expression of fear, wait, which means not try to fix it, change it, or impose our solutions, and not judge it as sinful. We then let the Holy Spirit do His part, which means to share His perception. Since we are very skilled in making our insane lives work according to the ego's upside-down strategies, it is very difficult for us \"not to interfere.\" Most of us are great \"doers,\" and need to learn from Jesus to wait patiently."

    "output": "Both and neither. I am in your dream if you react to me in any way, and you are in my dream if I react to you in any way. Strictly speaking--remembering we are talking about an illusory process--there is only one dreamer dreaming a dream of separation from God that involves denying responsibility for that choice to have a special, individual life of its own, which has become equated with sinfulness deserving of punishment. The means of carrying out this objective of keeping individuality while avoiding responsibility for it is to have a multitude of individuals in some form of victim-victimizer relationship. The internal sense of sinfulness can then be projected onto someone else who then is perceived as the guilty sinner. So if you and I are in a relationship, it is because a larger self has split off into this relationship between two people to conceal what is really going on in its mind."

    "text_input": "Q #501: How can one perceive forgiveness correctly, in Jesus' eyes, after suffering years of verbal and physical abuse?",
    "output": "First, true forgiveness never involves denying that something terrible happened. It focuses entirely on your thoughts and which teacher you choose to help you: the ego or Jesus. To the ego, your situation can be seen only through the eyes of separation: an innocent victim and a sinful victimizer. And the ego may support forgiveness, but it would still be in the context of an innocent victim forgiving a sinful victimizer. This is the common approach of the world and most religions of the world--that sin actually takes place but is forgiven. Jesus calls this false forgiveness or \"forgiveness-to-destroy,\" for despite the appearance of piety, it supports the thought system of separation, and therefore can never lead to lasting, true peace. Forgiveness seen through Jesus' eyes is marked by an absence of judgment or condemnation. Again, it does not deny attack or pain; and it does not mean that criminal prosecution cannot be pursued. The basis of this approach is our learning that the peace of God is in our minds because we are His Child. Because it is God's peace, nothing whatsoever has power to take it away. We can choose to turn away from it, but we cannot destroy it. Nothing can. Therefore to blame someone or something else for our lack of peace is to engage in a form of self-deception. Casting blame denies the truth about the peace in our minds. The other dimension of this is that in our wrong minds we always carry the unbearable burden of guilt over our choice to separate ourselves from God. The pain of this guilt, as well as the expectation of extreme punishment for our sin, causes us to deny it in ourselves and project it onto someone outside us, who would then be seen as deserving of condemnation. Therefore, in our wrong minds we would use situations in the world for this purpose of getting rid of our guilt. Jesus teaches us that that strategy does not work, for the guilt just stays in our minds and is reinforced by the deception. (T-13.II.1:1-2; X.3:1,3,5,7) Jesus would have us turn to him when we feel we have been victimized so that he could help us use the very same situation to unlearn what the ego taught us. Without denying the objective events that took place, Jesus would help us recognize our projection and then withdraw it, so that we can see the original mistake we made, which is judging ourselves guilty of having destroying love. He would help us realize the impossibility of that; and if we could accept it, we would be free of guilt and consequently be at peace, recognizing at the same time that that is the truth about everyone. In that state of mind, there is no way we could ever condemn ourselves or anyone else, regardless of what has been done behaviorally. The facts are still facts. But our reaction or interpretation would have changed completely. That is why Jesus explains that in true forgiveness we forgive what was not done to us. From this place of love and peace in our minds, we would then do and say what is most loving for all concerned. What that would look like in any given situation cannot be determined ahead of time. It could mean having no further contact with the attacker, pursuing prosecution, talking with the person, going to therapy with the person, or any number of other things. But the perspective would no longer be that of victim and victimizer. Through the gentle eyes of Jesus, we would see that an attacker is a Son of God, too, and shares the same wrong and right mind and the ability to choose between them that we do. He would help us see that concealed beneath all viciousness is tremendous fear and a call for love. It cannot be stressed too much, though, that this does not involve the denial of the objective facts of the attack, or the pain one is feeling. Finally, Jesus would help us learn that when we judge others as deserving of condemnation, we are doing the same thing to ourselves. He is always teaching us that we are all really one, and so because of this oneness, we cannot condemn another person without at the same time condemning ourselves. \"Forgive and be forgiven. As you give you receive\" (W-pI.122.6:3-4). This undoes the ego's main principle that it is always one or the other: my innocence is bought at your expense. But Jesus does not underestimate the difficulty of our accepting this, or its importance in achieving our goal of inner peace. He states that this idea, \"completely alien to the ego and the thinking of the world, is crucial to the thought reversal that this course will bring about. If you believed this statement, there would be no problem in complete forgiveness, certainty of goal, and sure direction. You would understand the means by which salvation comes to you, and would not hesitate to use it now\" (W-pI.126.1). Surely, comprehending A Course in Miracles metaphysics of non-dualism is necessary in order to relate to these ideas fully and avoid misinterpretations; so further study may be helpful. Also there are some other Questions that have addressed this area of the Course's teachings: #174ii, #200, and #481."

    "text_input": "Q #502: I participate in a martial art that over the years has caused me a lot of pain. A Course in Miracles says that the pain is in the mind and that the body, being a neutral thing, can not feel any pain. That is, my mind projects upon my body the pain that only the mind is aware of. Yet do I not have a choice? Can I not choose to practice my art and not feel any pain? Is the reason that I feel the pain because I want to punish myself?",
    "output": "Whenever we experience pain in relationship to anything in the world, it is always because that person, thing, event, or activity is a projected symbol of the guilt and pain in our minds. And it is our minds that have deceptively placed responsibility for the pain and the guilt on the external symbols. We all share the same pain in the mind, but it will be experienced through different symbols for each of us. The symbols themselves are never the cause of the pain. But our belief that they are is what keeps the ego in business, with the thought of separation real, for we are now oblivious to the choice for pain we have made in our minds. We remain mindless, seemingly at the mercy of events and forces outside--separate from--ourselves, for which we bear no responsibility. You have begun to recognize the role of the mind in your own experience with the martial art. If you wish to have a different experience, the first step is to identify the purpose you've given it. Why do you value it? There are a range of possibilities, such as feeling more powerful, more in control, more disciplined, safer, more protected, more in tune with your body, etc. Whenever we value anything of the world, it is for ego reasons. This does not make it bad, but if we do not recognize the ego motivations, the ego will be in the driver's seat and we won't know it. And that means whatever decisions we make about the things of the world that attract us will be double-edged, that is, they will be sources of both pleasure and pain (T-19.IV-B.12:1). To the ego, this is proof that the separation and sin are real, that there are things outside of ourselves that can affect us and cause us pain--for who would choose pain for himself? At one level we believe that pain is God's punishment for our selfish pursuit of our own pleasures, and at a deeper unconscious level, we believe that the pain is a self-inflicted punishment to atone for our attack on God. Yet Jesus makes it clear that pain \"is not really punitive at all. It is but the inevitable result of equating yourself with the body, which is the invitation to pain\" (T-19.IV-B.12:3-4). In other words, believing that we are separate from love is a thought of limitation and deprivation, which by its very nature brings pain with it. Our belief in pain as punishment, either God's or ours, is a smokescreen that covers over the real source, our choice for separation. The key then is not to give up the external expressions of the ego--that only reinforces the ego's demand for sacrifice, another seemingly external cause of pain, which it would want us to attribute to God--but to become more aware of their underlying meaning and purpose as the ego's symbols. If we use them to support our belief in separation, to reinforce our acceptance of the ego's goal of self rather than shared interests, then pain will inevitably be associated with them. But if we become willing to look at our investment in the ego's purpose for pain, and realize it has to do with our thoughts and not the external symbols, the ego's unconscious hold on our decision-making will begin to weaken. For once we become aware of what we are choosing in our minds and why, we will begin to see more readily through the ego's lies and deceits. And then we can give the symbols of our world, such as your martial art, a different purpose. They can then become the Holy Spirit's classroom in which we learn to undo our guilt and release our internal pain, rather than the ego's prison in which we continue to reinforce our guilt and cling to the pain, but fail to recognize its source."

    "text_input": "Q #503: I have been studying A Course in Miracles for about 90 lessons, and sometimes I get the feeling that I'm missing something. I think I should have had a revelatory experience in the previous lessons as part of my learning process. So I feel like I'm missing part of the foundation of the learning plan. When the Course instructs me to listen or let me be guided to my Self, I have absolutely no idea what to do. I sit quietly trying to clear my mind and listen to something that could indicate I'm doing the exercise correctly. But I don't hear/feel anything. My question is: Is it necessary for a student to have experiences of right-mindedness during the exercises? Is it normal for a student to miss experiences? Do they come with later lessons?",
    "output": "What you have discovered in your efforts to practice the lessons is exactly what the workbook would like us to learn: we \"have absolutely no idea what to do.\" That is a very important discovery and, in one sense is a \"revelation.\" This insight and your honesty give you a very firm foundation for the learning process. As Jesus tells us in the text: \"I am leading you to a new kind of experience that you will become less and less willing to deny\" (T-11.VI.3:6). We can only be led if we are willing to follow, and that requires the recognition that we do not know where we are going. If not knowing means letting go of any judgment of what an experience is, what the outcome of the lesson should be, and willingness to let the Holy Spirit be in charge of the process, then it may indeed be a right minded experience in itself. The Course is a gentle process that asks only that we have \"a little willingness\" in practicing forgiveness: \"Your part is only to offer Him a little willingness to let Him remove all fear and hatred, and to be forgiven\" (T-18.V.2:5). Continued practice of the instructions given in the workbook will lead eventually to seeing things differently. Small, but significant insights, such as you describe, are very helpful in this process. It is common for students to miss the small, important steps. Spectacular experiences are not necessary, some may even be subtly disguised ego devices, more harmful than helpful. We need not strive for experiences. It is dedication to the practice and application of what the workbook teaches, which leads to the experience that will occur naturally. As the Introduction to the workbook tells us: \"You are merely asked to apply the ideas as you are directed to do ... it is their use that will give them meaning to you, and will show you that they are true\" (W-in.8:3,6)."

    "text_input": "Q #504: I understand that we have made the decision to forget. My question is, why did we reject a state in which we clearly enjoyed peace of mind, in order to enter into time and space? Who in their right mind would feel dissatisfied with the original peace of mind?",
    "output": "No one in his right mind would choose to forget who he is, which is why no one in his right mind does. Your question is asked very frequently. It is actually a statement framed in the form of a question, because the question implies that the separation did in fact occur, and that time and space do exist. A Course in Miracles provides the ultimate answer: \" ... the separation never occurred\" (T-6.II.10:7). Jesus tells us we cannot forget our true Identity as God's innocent Son, but can misuse the power of our minds by choosing separation and believing in the illusion of a separate identity. The very important principle at work here is the power of the mind to choose. The choice is always between truth and illusion, what is real and what is not. Since there is no substitute for God, and no alternative to reality, choosing not to believe in truth is really choosing nothing. However, the belief that it is something results in guilt for having obliterated God and His Son from awareness, replacing them with the made up ego self. The effects are all the devastating, painful experiences of \"life\" in the body and the world, which lead us to ask ourselves how we got here and why we came. Since Jesus knows we believe in our identity as bodies, he offers an explanation we can understand and work with: we believe we are bodies in the world because this is what we want to believe. The \"original\" moment of separation, that seems to have occurred in the past, is actually an ongoing choice for separation that is evident in the daily experiences in our lives. The clues are there for us to see in our energetic pursuit of selfish interests, at the expense of others' interests, not to mention our devotion and dedication to being right. To paraphrase an often quoted phrase from the text; we would rather be right than peaceful (T-29.VII.1:9). It is this which motivates us, here and now, to choose our little selves and little lives over God. Thus, in its important goal of teaching us that we have minds with the power to choose, the Course itself is the answer to your question. Our hope lies in following Jesus' clear and direct invitation: \"My brother, choose again\" (T-31.VIII.3:2). For more on this topic please see #10."

    "text_input": "Q #505: Could you give a simple explanation of the crucifixion and the resurrection?",
    "output": "As you know, the crucifixion and resurrection are the foundation of traditional Christianity. At its core are beliefs about sin, atonement, sacrifice, redemption, and death. In A Course in Miracles Jesus reinterprets each of these concepts. The Course teaches that the separation never truly happened, and therefore the world does not exist. Our experience in the dream, including the crucifixion and resurrection of the historical Jesus, is part of the illusion. That is the simplest explanation the Course offers. On another level, however, since we do believe in the separation and the reality of the world and its \"history,\" Jesus reinterprets the \"events\" that we believe occurred, and the concepts on which they are based. In the text he tells us: \"The real meaning of the crucifixion lies in the apparent intensity of the assault of some of the Sons of God upon another. This, of course, is impossible, and must be fully understood as impossible. Otherwise, I cannot serve as a model for learning\" (T-6.I.3:4-6). As a symbol of the part of our minds that accepts the truth of who we are, Jesus does not identify with the body, accepts his identity as God's innocent Son, and knows that his life is in God alone. This is what the Course refers to as acceptance of the Atonement. It is not achieved through sacrifice, nor death, but through this recognition. The crucifixion then becomes what Jesus tells us in the text: \" ... nothing more than an extreme example. Its value, like the value of any teaching device, lies solely in the kind of learning it facilitates\" (T-6.I.2:1-2). Put very simply, it is meant to teach that Jesus seemed to die and seemed to rise from the dead to teach us that we are not bodies, that nothing is accomplished through death, that nothing happened. When we accept this we are \"resurrected\" in the sense that we rise from the death of the ego's lies to the life of truth: \"Very simply, the resurrection is the overcoming or surmounting of death. It is a reawakening or a rebirth; a change of mind about the meaning of the world. It is the acceptance of the Holy Spirit's interpretation of the world's purpose; the acceptance of the Atonement for oneself. It is the end of dreams of misery, and the glad awareness of the Holy Spirit's final dream\" (M-28.1:1- 4)."

    "text_input": "Q #506: In T-19:IV-D:1:4 of A Course in Miracles, Jesus refers to the Divine Abstraction as: \"The Creator of life, the Source of everything that lives, the Father of the universe and of the universe of universes, and of everything that lies even beyond them ... \" I would appreciate your  helping me to understand why this particular wording of \"universe of universes\" has been chosen, since the universe and everything that appears to 'live' is a fabrication of our minds.",
    "output": "Throughout the Course, Jesus uses symbols and the language of duality because that is what we understand. Since he knows how terrified we are of God and of our truth, his use of specific words is a loving and gentle way to lead us beyond our fear. He speaks to us of bodies, toys, houses, cities, money--all the things we believe are real and to which we cling. He uses words to describe the indescribable: Heaven, God, totality, oneness, timelessness. He speaks in poetic terms of experiences that are beyond words. While the form varies, the content is always a loving message. The passage you quote is a poetic way of telling us that as Father of the universe of spirit, of Christ and His creations, God is everything. If we were ready to accept the truth of Who God is and Who we are, we would not need A Course in Miracles, or it would be sufficient to say: \"Oneness is simply the idea God is. And in His Being, He encompasses all things. No mind holds anything but Him. We say 'God is,' and then we cease to speak, for in that knowledge words are meaningless. There are no lips to speak them, and no part of mind sufficiently distinct to feel that it is now aware of something not itself\" (W-pI.169.5:1-5). Because we are fiercely attached to our belief in separation and our identity as bodies, we need the truth to be presented to us in a variety of ways, over and over, so we can grasp its meaning and find our way through the labyrinth of confusion our upside-down thinking has fabricated. That is why the basic principles of the Course are repeated in many different ways, and the message of God's Love for us is expressed in poetic, inspiring words intended to help us past our fear."

    "text_input": "Q #507: Am I correct in saying that every judgment, every instance of anger ... every time we turn to the ego (the wrong mind) is a cry for pain and suffering and identically a cover against a cry for love, of going to the right mind?",
    "output": "Yes, anger, judgment, and choosing the wrong mind are all attacks; and yes, each one is a call for love. They are the effects of having chosen the separation, thereby identifying with the ego, which is the ultimate attack on the Son of God because it is a denial of our true Identity. What inevitably follows is a profound sense of loss and emptiness. What is lost is awareness of love's presence. This loss is experienced in the feelings of deprivation, scarcity, need, and incompleteness that are at the root of every attack, whereby we seek to take from others what we think we lack. It is a desperate attempt to get back the love that was lost in the choice to separate. The choice is forgotten and denied, while the guilt for having made it is buried and projected out to everyone who is now perceived as having stolen the love and wholeness that are rightfully ours. Born of a deep sense of deprivation, attack is believed to be the only way to get what we need from everyone and everything outside of ourselves. In this search, whether it takes the form of special love or special hate, the ego seeks to fill the void left by the separation. Attack expresses the fear that what was lost will never again be found. It is therefore, an expression of fear. By thus reinterpreting attack, A Course in Miracles teaches us a new way of perceiving it. It can now be seen as a way of \"looking for love in all the wrong places,\" as the song goes. The attacker is desperately seeking the \"lost love.\" However, no matter how perverse an attack may seem to be, it has not obliterated the part of the mind that holds the memory of God's Love. If we are willing to let go of the ego's judgment and accept the Holy Spirit's interpretation, we acknowledge the right mind of the attacker and allow the Holy Spirit to respond with love. Thus the wrong mind is not reinforced, the attack is not perpetuated, and the love that was sought is found in the right place: the part of the mind of the attacker that remembers love, whenever he or she is ready to accept it. As Jesus tells us in the text: \"This is what recognizing fear really means. If you do not protect it, He [the Holy Spirit] will reinterpret it. That is the ultimate value in learning to perceive attack as a call for love\" (T-12.I.8:8-10)."

    "text_input": "Q #508: According to the teachings of A Course in Miracles, how do I understand what is the lesson I have to learn from a situation that keeps coming over up and over again, which is more difficult each time? Is it that I have not been successful in getting the point, or might it be better to consider this a lifetime lesson and give up hoping not to repeat it?",
    "output": "Any situation that seems be a difficult one that recurs in our lives is simply a lesson in forgiveness that we have yet to accept. And what does that mean? That there is a guilty self- accusation that we are not yet willing to look at and so must keep projecting outside of ourselves so that it seems that the cause of the guilt and the pain is external rather than internal. The forms that these projections take are the specific relationships in our lives that seem to bring us distress and pain. But rather than seeing them as situations to get over and hopefully avoid in the future, the Course invites us to look upon them as our special function, the particular form in which we learn that our brother is guiltless and that therefore we are innocent as well (T-25.VI.4-7; T- 25.VII.7-9). Now the specific form of the lesson is \"suited to your special needs, and to the special time and place in which you think you find yourself\" although \"the content is [always] the same\" (T- 25.VII.7:2-3). And this simply means that the form is the one that the ego originally made in order for us to feel at the mercy of someone or something else, so that responsibility for how we feel seems to rest on the outside situation. And if we have managed in our lives to escape from the situation at one time or another, it will simply reappear in a somewhat different form (a \"new\" relationship), for it is always mirroring what remains to be healed within. The specific situation represents a particular expression of whatever specific belief about the separation from God we are unconsciously holding onto--betrayal, abandonment, rejection, loss, inadequacy, etc. And behind each of those thoughts stands the self-accusation--for this is what we believe we did to God when we chose our individual self over His Love. So if we can identify the unforgiveness or judgment associated with each recurrence of the difficult situation, the next step is having the willingness to accept responsibility for that thought without self- condemnation, that is, \"with the Holy Spirit's kind perception of specialness; His use of what you made, to heal instead of harm\" (T-25.VI.4:1). And it is in that process of looking without judgment that we are released from the inner guilt that has been fueling the external projections. Does this mean that the external situation will no longer occur? Not necessarily. But it will mean that we will no longer interpret it in personal terms, that is, we will no longer feel in some way victimized by it or at its mercy, as we are learning to recognize that nothing outside ourselves can affect us. In Jesus' words from the end of the text: \"Trials are but lessons that you failed to learn presented once again, so where you made a faulty choice before you now can make a better one, and thus escape all pain that what you chose before has brought to you. In every difficulty, all distress, and each perplexity Christ calls to you and gently says, 'My brother, choose again.' He would not leave one source of pain unhealed, nor any image left to veil the truth. He would remove all misery from you whom God created altar unto joy. He would not leave you comfortless, alone in dreams of hell, but would release your mind from everything that hides His face from you\" (T-31.VIII.3:1-5)."

But I have difficulty when I put myself, as one with the Sonship, in the place of the mothers and fathers of those killed and injured. Please help me.",
    "output": "The ego doesn't care if we are able to be peaceful about one difficult situation, so long as there remain other situations over which we lose our peace. To the ego, it's all the same. For its unstated goal is to keep us in conflict. The ego thrives on the belief in victims and victimizers. And it does not matter whether we see ourselves or someone with whom we identify as the victim--including our country's soldiers and their families. It's only critical that the dynamic of victimization be real for us. Can we also feel at one with the victimizer--such as the Iraqi insurgents or the so-called terrorists--and still feel love? There is a way, but it is not something we can do on our own, and we need first to understand all the obstacles we've placed between ourselves and peace. We made the world with all its battles and wars, from the interpersonal to the international level, to convince ourselves that the separation thought is real but that we are not responsible for it. And so it seems that there are forces outside ourselves--separate from us--that affect us in ways over which we have no control. In other words, there are victimizers and victims. Our investment in this thought system is much deeper than most of us even begin to comprehend. For it keeps the guilt over our pain and suffering resting outside our own minds so that we never see our own role in deciding for pain by deciding for separation. Yet the two choices--separation and pain-- are intrinsically and unavoidably linked. In fact, they are the same choice. But it is the ego's goal, and the world's purpose, to keep that relationship forever obliterated from our awareness. We will never be able to be truly at peace and experience the genuine love of the Sonship until we recognize that link and ask for Help in undoing our belief in separation and the reality of our own guilt over it. For ultimately we accuse ourselves of separating from God and setting in motion a world of pain and suffering. But so long as we do not wish to accept that responsibility so that the choice can be undone, we can only struggle and fail to find peace and love in situations that appear to be anything but peaceful and loving. The key to healing our perception of pain in the world is to learn to recognize that the external situation is never the cause of our loss of peace. It is always the decision within our own minds to be separate from love. And we can not overcome this decision on our own simply by choosing to see ourselves at one with others. We first must look at our investment in seeing ourselves as separate but not responsible for it, in whatever form we may make that real in our lives. By joining in our minds with Jesus or the Holy Spirit, we will accept without guilt the correction for our belief in separation, for they hold no judgment against us for the insane but impossible thought that we have attacked love through our desire to be separate. If the guilt of our own mind is healed, which is the source of our pain, we will no longer see the pain and suffering of the world as anything more than the delusional result of false decisions each fragment of the Sonship is making about itself, just as we have been doing. There is a beautiful prayer that comes early in the text of A Course in Miracles that can serve as a helpful reminder of what this process of choosing between the ego and the Holy Spirit is always about: I must have decided wrongly, because I am not at peace. I made the decision myself, but I can also decide otherwise. I want to decide otherwise, because I want to be at peace. I do not feel guilty, because the Holy Spirit will undo all the consequences of my wrong decision if I will let Him. I choose to let Him, by allowing Him to decide for God for me (T-5.VII.6:7-11).

    "text_input": "Q #510: Considering \"The Test of Truth\" that Jesus talks about in Chapter 14 of the text of A Course in Miracles, how could Jesus be crucified? I can understand his being free of fear during those \"attacks\" on his body, which is a potent example of forgiveness. But it seems clear to me that torturing and crucifying a brother is not a manifestation of perfect peace, which is what everyone who met him (or even thought of him) should have felt. Is it that Jesus tried at times to learn his own lesson and not God's?",
    "output": "It may be helpful first to look at the specific line you are referring to in that section: \"If you are wholly free of fear of any kind, and if all those who meet or even think of you share in your perfect peace, then you can be sure that you have learned God's lesson, and not your own\" (T- 14.XI.5:2). There are certainly a number of different ways of looking at this passage in relationship to the crucifixion. The first question we could ask ourselves is whether the crucifixion is fact or fiction. It is after all our dream and Jesus does not perceive himself to be a part of it, so perhaps the story is merely the imaginings of followers who were attempting to make his seeming life here seem bigger than life, concocting a story of physical death and physical resurrection. However, Jesus does discuss the crucifixion in Chapter 6 as if it were an historical event in his earthly life, so we can consider what this passage may mean in light of such a happening. One possibility, as you suggest, is that Jesus perhaps was still identified with his ego up until the time of his crucifixion and so was not in perfect peace. The attacks by others against him then were simply part of his own lessons in forgiveness. However, since the crucifixion, and with the coming of his Course now to the world, few would reasonably deny that he is a manifestation of perfect peace. Yet even today, there are many in the world who know of him and think of him who are not at peace, who feel anger at times towards him, even as students of his Course. Is this proof that he still has dark, unlearned lessons? This seems most unlikely. In fact, earlier in the Course, Jesus remarks on people's unpeaceful reactions to him when he seemed to be among them, although his words apply equally to his students today: \"Many thought I was attacking them, even though it was apparent I was not\" (T- 6.V-B.1:5). He goes on to explain that when we do not share another's thought system, we are weakening it, and as a result we will be perceived as attacking, even though we are not. For each of us sees outside what we have first seen within (T-6.V-B.1:7-11). Perhaps the problem is that we are misunderstanding Jesus' meaning with this passage. The line in fact says that all \"who think ... of you share in your perfect peace.\" But it does not say that everyone accepts this perfect peace and is at peace. If my mind is healed, I know that everyone whom I know and who knows me must share this perfect peace with me for it to be perfect peace, no matter how their minds may choose in any moment in time to deny the reality of that experience. However, if I find others reacting to me and judging me and I react to that in any way, then I am not in perfect peace and I still have my own dark lessons to be learned. And since, in the end, there is really no one else out there, I am only ever concerned with the state of my mind, and how I may be in reaction to what I perceive to be other minds separate from me. For once I truly know we are all one, my experience in relationship to all the aspects of that one self--all the seemingly separate fragments--can only be one of perfect peace, which must be shared with every aspect as one, whether or not they are manifesting that peace at any particular moment in time."

    "text_input": "Q #511: The idea of separation is one huge, elaborate and childish temper tantrum, which although insane is a reflection of how clever we are. My question is, once I remember who I really am and am back in that experience of myself, what then? Would it not be eternal boredom that drove us to this way of thinking? Also, how can we be so self-deceived by one guilty thought to create a need for this world and its dark and lengthy history? It seems to me that knowing the reality of God's Love exists on a knife's edge. Who's to say that once a complete Atonement of the Sonship has occurred that we will not fall into this experience of ourselves again?",
    "output": "In truth, it is only from our self-deceiving, self-aggrandizing perspective, identified as a seemingly tiny self in a seemingly infinite and overwhelming universe, that the idea of separation and its consequences seem huge or elaborate or clever or dark or temporally and spatially vast. From Jesus' perspective, it is all absolutely nothing. He only describes the layers of complexity that seem to have spun out from the initial illusory thought because we believe in them and have made them very real in our own minds and so need help in extricating ourselves from the confusing labyrinth of our imaginary beliefs. Truly, this world and our so very important lives are \"much ado about nothing,\" to quote the Bard. Nothing has happened, which is the simple statement of the Atonement principle. So how can nothing happen again? And if nothing happens again, it will still be nothing. Nothing multiplied by nothing, no matter how many times you multiply it, is still nothing. Nothing divided and subdivided, over and over again, remains nothing. And nothing repeatedly added to nothing always yields the same result--nothing. As for eternal boredom motivating the split from eternal Love, that makes perfect sense--from the delusional, illusory ego point of view. If we genuinely are convinced that having conflict and pain because we believe we lack all that we truly need is preferable to knowing that we have all that we truly need, then perhaps the thought of separation is a sane alternative to Heaven. But it is only an ego-based perspective with extreme tunnel vision that could possibly believe that the excitement of uncertain, yet inevitable, loss and the occasional, unpredictable release from agonizing suffering is to be preferred to the quiet certainty of eternal bliss.

    "text_input": "Q #512: Two questions have been submitted recently on the theme of Christian Science. Both are noted below and the answer addresses the two of them together:  Compared with A Course in Miracles, how does Christian Science \"heal\" with mind?  I have been a student of A Course In Miracles for thirteen years but have been frustrated that my study and practice did not seem to be helping me with some practical problems. I discovered that Christian Science also teaches that we are spirit and not a body, so I recently started attending a Christian Science church, and was healed of some long standing physical problems and a smoking addiction. The Christian Science church says that Jesus said: \"By their fruits ye shall know them,\" and that his followers would do greater works than his. This is the basis for their emphasis on healing, which seems to work. What is the Course's view on this? Does it say anywhere that we will heal and be healed? I am uncomfortable with some of Mary Baker Eddy's writings on sin and punishment, and much of the Bible, and feel much more comfortable with the teachings of the Course. Is there any way I can get the practical healing of the Christian Science way, but by study of the Course rather than Christian Science?",
    "output": "There are many striking parallels at the metaphysical level between the teachings of Christian Science and the Course. Both proclaim the reality of spirit and the unreality of sin and sickness. Both see the latter as errors of a mind that has forgotten its true nature and only Life in God, Who is only Love and Who can be the source of nothing unlike Himself. But at the level of purpose and practice they may be seen to diverge. Christian Science has a major focus on healing the illnesses of the body as a demonstration of the truth and validity of its principles. The Course, as you have been aware, has no concern for bringing about change at the level of form, or the body. Its purpose is to teach and accelerate the process of forgiveness in the mind as a means of awakening from the dream, and not simply for the \"healing\" of its effects as experienced in the body. The process of healing articulated by Christian Science reflects principles similar to the Course's: that all physical healing comes from a decision of the mind and that the ministrations of physicians and healers in the realm of medicine and other material interventions have an effect only because of the beliefs in the mind of the one who is sick. But Christian Science advocates going to the source of illness in the mind in order to bring about the physical healing, rather than turning to the physicians of the world, while the Course bypasses concern with the effects of the mind's error and advocates changing the mind so that the mind itself can be healed of its guilt. Along the way, the body may very well be healed, and the Course suggests that in several passages (e.g., W-pI.136.17; M-5.II.2). But that is never the goal. Jesus remarks in one passage, which may be seen as a correction for Christian Science's emphasis on the body's healing: \"Thus is the body healed by miracles because they show the mind made sickness, and employed the body to be victim, or effect, of what it made. Yet half the lesson will not teach the whole. The miracle is useless if you learn but that the body can be healed, for this is not the lesson it was sent to teach. The lesson is the mind was sick that thought the body could be sick; projecting out its guilt caused nothing, and had no effects\" (T-28.II.11:4-7). Because Mary Baker Eddy was concerned with defending the validity of Christian Science against its detractors, she emphasized its greater effectiveness in bringing about release from symptoms in comparison to traditional medical interventions, which she perceived as only reinforcing the erroneous belief in the power of matter in the minds of physician and patient alike. As a result, there has been a strong tendency for many of her followers to take the position that seeking medical intervention is somehow wrong, even sinful. The Course, because of its emphasis on awakening from the dream, accepts that the mind may need to use whatever means it can accept, including doctors and medicine, to allay its fears that are being manifested as physical symptoms. But over time the mind will come to accept its power of choice in all matters, as its fear of acknowledging that power, as well as the accompanying guilt, diminishes through the practice of forgiveness (T-2.IV.4-5). There is nothing wrong with using the teachings of Christian Science to help resolve physical symptoms and problems you may be experiencing. But it may be helpful to keep in mind Jesus' words, noted above. For if your only purpose is to heal your body, you will have missed the tremendous opportunity for healing the guilt in your mind over the separation that the physical symptoms always point back to. But as you remember the Course's purpose, the application of the principles of Christian Science may become a helpful classroom in which to deepen your understanding of the Course's teachings on forgiveness, as you appreciate the similarities as well as the important differences between the two paths."

    "output": "It would be more accurate to say that the decision-making part of the mind, when it is aligned with the Holy Spirit and observing the ego without judgment, is similar to the witness in Eastern teachings. While the Course speaks of the Holy Spirit as if He were a distinct entity that performs certain functions, such as Guide, Comforter, Interpreter, Teacher, and Voice for God, as we progress with the Course, we will come to see that these are only useful symbols or metaphors for a mind that still believes in duality and so still believes help is needed from a source outside itself (for further discussion on the Course's symbolic or metaphorical use of language, see #72 and #156). The Holy Spirit plays no active role in the mind but is simply a Thought or a Presence that reminds. It reminds us of the other way, the peaceful, conflict-free, alternative to the ego (T-5.II.7:1-7). And it is that reminder that allows us to look at our ego without guilt or fear or condemnation."

    "text_input": "Q #514: The following answers are in response to different questions posed by the same person.  (i): What is A Course in Miracles' teaching regarding karma?",
    "output": "Although A Course in Miracles does not use the word karma, which is the term found in Eastern spiritual teachings for the law of cause and effect, the Course certainly addresses the concept in many passages. Linear time is a central aspect of karma, or cause and effect, in the ego's world. In the Course, Jesus tells us that cause and effect are not separate (T-26.VII.13:1) and it is only in the thought system of separation that the two can seem distinct. And it is only in the world of separation and time that karma, or the world's law of cause and effect, can operate. Once we find ourselves (by our choice) within the world's belief system, karma becomes neutral, although initially the ego developed the notion of cause and effect to establish the reality of separation, including the consequences of guilt and punishment for our attack on God. None of this of course is real, from the Course's perspective. But given that we believe in the law of cause and effect--a by-product of our belief in the reality of the separation-- Jesus shows us a gentler application of the principle. The ego would have us believe that there are inevitable consequences for all our acts and failures to act within the world. Good acts beget good consequences and bad acts beget bad consequences. And there is a dualistic balance that needs to be maintained, or a debt that has to be paid, as a result of all of our choices in the world. Jesus, however, shifts the focus from the world to our mind, where he helps us learn to recognize that the only choice we are ever really making is in our mind, between the ego thought system and the thought system of the Holy Spirit. And it is only within the mind that cause and effect have any real meaning. Each thought system has consequences in terms of whether or not we experience peace of mind. And our peace in the present depends only on our choice in the present, having nothing to do with any decision we have made in the past. This understanding has the potential of releasing us from the karmic cycle that seems to require that we experience the consequences of our actions in time and space. And forgiveness is the Course's practice for releasing us from any so-called karmic debt. For additional discussions on karma from the perspective of the Course, see #332 and #363."

    "text_input": "Q #515: A friend of mine has recently started studying the Kabbalah. Do you believe that A Course in Miracles and Kabbalah are compatible?",
    "output": "On the level of form, spiritual paths are not really compatible with each other, since they reflect different approaches both to understanding and realizing truth. That is why there are different paths. On the level of content, however, since their goals are the same, differing paths are compatible in purpose. As the Eastern saying states: \"Truth is one; the sages know it by many names. And in A Course in Miracles: \"There are many thousands of other forms [of the universal course], all with the same outcome\" (M-1.4.2). In speaking about A Course in Miracles and the Kabbalah, we can make the same observation. Their goal is truth, or God, yet they are different in theology and in practice. The Course's metaphysics is non-dualistic, while the Kabbalah--not an integrated body of teaching, by the way--is not. Forgiveness, the central focus of A Course in Miracles, is not primary at all in the Kabbalah; nor is the role of the Holy Spirit. Both thought systems, however, emphasize the importance of reuniting God's fragmented creation. A Course in Miracles would see this fragmentation as illusory, a point the Kabbalah does not recognize. In the end, however, if one's spiritual path is enhanced by both the Kabbalah and A Course in Miracles, then who is to say that is a mistake? \"By their fruits you shall know them\" remains the only criterion that matters. If the combined practice of these two spiritualities leads to a life of peace and love, then one would be a fool not to pursue it."

    "text_input": "Q #516: For years I studied about reincarnation, past lives, hypnotic regression, soul mates, communication with spirit guides, guardian angels, and deceased loved one, etc. I learned how divine friends help us plan each lifetime --selecting our family, country, trials and tribulations, etc.--in order to balance our karma and progress spiritually by overcoming our problems here. Now A Course in Miracles tells me that the ego has set up our lives, not to experience spiritual growth, but to continue to be victimized and victimize others. If all these guides and helpers are miscreations of our egos, can they serve a holy purpose? Are past life memories stored in the brain or are they in the ego mind? I also studied the power of thought to attract all the worldly things we may want. Is this the brain or just our ego mind miscreating by wanting something? I learned through religion to pray to God through Jesus for help and received many, many answers, for which I thanked them. Now the Course tells me they weren't listening. So how were all those prayers answered--the ego mind again, or the brain?  I see now what a distraction all this was for me. Some of what I was sure was the \"gospel truth\" (according to the ego) certainly kept me from looking elsewhere. But through it all many truths showed up that prepared me for the Course. So how should I look at all this?",
    "output": "Perhaps it would be most helpful simply to remind you that everything, including A Course in Miracles, comes within an ego framework (C-in.3:1). And the only criterion for evaluating anything in the world of form (which includes everything you've listed in your question) is to ask whether it has been helpful in learning to forgive ourselves and our brothers and sisters. And what is helpful depends on where we are in our process of remembering who we are. (See for example M-25.) It is only the ego that would want to judge whether the manner in which we have spent our time in the past has been helpful or not. If what we have done has prepared us for accepting the truth of who we are at a deeper level that is surely enough. And if it has provided us comfort in knowing that we are loved and that guilt serves no useful purpose, it has been a reflection of the one Love that joins us all, in a form that our fearful minds could accept. Yes, if we remain stuck in any particular form, it is likely that we will fall into the trap of using it to reinforce specialness and separation. But anything that leads us to recognize that there is more to us than the limited reality of our meager lives in this world of conflict and pain is helpful. And anyone or anything, although appearing separate from us--be it angels or guides or ascended masters or whatever--that helps us learn that we deserve to escape from our limitations has served a holy purpose. No matter what the form of our lives as we have set them up, they always have two possible purposes, depending on which teacher we choose to learn from. The Holy Spirit, in contrast to the ego, will never direct us to do anything that will deliberately cause us pain. Rather He will support our choice to learn from our experiences that there is an alternative to pain and suffering. And so guidance from the Holy Spirit, whether it seems to occur prior to or during a specific lifetime, may direct us to participate in certain relationships--not to be victimized again, but to heal them by learning that victimization is impossible. It is the mind--and never the brain, which only follows the programing of the mind--which determines what our experiences will be. And the mind, not the brain, holds all the memories that it can choose to access as either past, present, or future lifetimes. In the \"reality\" of the split mind, they are all simultaneous. No doubt more questions will continue to arise in our minds, curious to know how this illusory world and the self that we made and still seem to love work. And yet, in the end, all of our questioning will cease and our need for all forms, including the Course itself, will subside. And then we will be ready to accept Jesus' gentle suggestion: \"Simply do this: Be still, and lay aside all thoughts of what you are and what God is; all concepts you have learned about the world; all images you hold about yourself. Empty your mind of everything it thinks is either true or false, or good or bad, of every thought it judges worthy, and all the ideas of which it is ashamed. Hold onto nothing. Do not bring with you one thought the past has taught, nor one belief you ever learned before from anything. Forget this world, forget this course, and come with wholly empty hands unto your God\" (W-pI.189.7)."

    "output": "The view of reality as presented in A Course in Miracles is that it is non-dualistic, a perfect Oneness, and therefore anything pertaining to form cannot be of God. The \"beauty\" of mathematics may indeed be used as a reminder of the beauty of oneness, but as a language of quantity, mathematics can only have come from the ego. The concept of coherence, for example, implies duality: parts sticking together. The language of God could never be understood by minds that believe they are individualized, which Jesus tells us many times in his Course, most notably and eloquently in Chapter 25 and Lesson 169: \" ... for while you think that part of you is separate, the concept of a Oneness joined as One is meaningless\" (T-25.I.7:1); \"We say 'God is,' and then we cease to speak, for in that knowledge words are meaningless\" (W-pI.169.5:4)."

    "text_input": "Q #518: I have been a student of A Course in Miracles for the past two years, and I recently read a book called I Am David. In the book the young boy is imprisoned for a period of months. He asks God why has this happened to him. After a sleep he wakes up and realizes that it was his own hatred of another boy that has imprisoned him. Now as I understand it, God showed him in his sleep the reason for his imprisonment. On waking, he understands this and writes a letter to this boy apologizing to him. He then finds a way to escape. Would it be correct to understand that Lesson 198 \"Only my condemnation injures me\" (W-pI.198) is saying exactly this? When things go wrong for me I try to see where I have done this, and then put it right. When I do this am I making my errors real? Should I just understand them, hand them over to the Holy Spirit, and just not do it again or should I try to put it right?",
    "output": "The lesson you refer to teaches us that our belief that we can in truth judge and condemn others or ourselves is the problem. The belief that we can rightfully judge and condemn makes us feel vulnerable, because we would then believe that others have that same ability and can use it against us to injure us. But Jesus is helping us realize that attack is impossible in reality; it can not be a part of us as God created us, and therefore it can only be part of an illusory existence: \"The stillness of your Self remains unmoved, untouched by thoughts like these, and unaware of any condemnation which could need forgiveness\" (8:1). So Jesus is talking about a deep layer of belief in our minds, which can be undone just by our forgiving ourselves for ever having thought it could be true-- it is just a silly thought. The application of this in our everyday lives involves first recognizing the cause and effect relationship between our unforgiving thoughts (our judgments and condemnation) and our suffering (9:5), and then the healing power of forgiveness (9:6). Forgiveness may or may not extend to behavior (making things right in form). The important aspect of this process is the perception of separate, conflicting interests--seeing our own interests as separate from another's. If that perception is not first present in our minds, attack and condemnation would be impossible, regardless of what has been done in the world. Thus if behavioral corrections are undertaken without a corresponding correction in perception, nothing of real value has been accomplished, even though relationships may seem to have been repaired externally. Further eruptions are inevitable if one's perception has not been corrected. And that is done simply by bringing the unloving thoughts of separation to the loving presence of Jesus or the Holy Spirit in our minds, where they will be seen as meaningless and without effect. One final observation. You say \"when things go wrong for me I try to see where I have done this, and then put it right.\" What you mean by \"things going wrong\" is not clear. All kinds of things may go wrong in a person's life-- for example, being robbed or cheated, losing a job, being wrongfully accused--but that does not necessarily mean the person is holding onto grievances or judgments. (Jesus' life did not seem to go all that well in the end, but his mind was totally without guilt.) The world was made to be a place where things go wrong, and egos can be quite vicious. However, if you do not perceive yourself as a victim, then you will not experience suffering. So we must be very cautious about judging simply on the basis of form or external appearances. David's experience therefore should not be taken as the norm of forgiveness. If you are aware of having attacked another person, it is always best to ask for guidance as to what is best for everyone involved before going to apologize. In other words, don't take it for granted that a literal apology is always the best expression of forgiveness. On another level, David's story could also be taken as symbolic of the Son's need to forgive himself for having accused himself of committing the \"unforgivable\" sin of destroying the Oneness of Heaven in order to have his own special existence as an individual. Forgiveness as taught in the Course is radically different from the world's version, which always sees sin as real but pardonable in certain instances and under certain conditions. The concept of sin is entirely an invention of the ego, and so our inner work is ultimately aimed at exposing and then letting go of this faulty belief."

    "text_input": "Q #519: I'm aware that my special relationship is standing in the way of my relationship with God and I know I must therefore \"really\" want the relationship with God more than the special relationship. Do you have any hints about how to deal with the moments of crisis when I can't seem to think clearly?",
    "output": "The first thing to recognize is that this is not an either-or situation. It is the ego that tells us we must give up or sacrifice our special relationships, as if we have to appease God's need that we have no false gods before Him. That is only the ego's foolishness. A Course in Miracles is very clear that it is not our relationships that we need to give up, but the purpose that we have given them (e.g., T-17.IV.2:3-7; T-21.III.6). The second point to remember is that it's not a sin to want a special relationship more than God. Jesus would tell us it's pretty foolish, because we're giving up everything for a little bit of nothing. But it's no cause for feelings of sinfulness and guilt, as the ego again would have us believe. Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, you don't want to forget that it is through our relationships with our brothers that we in fact find God (e.g., T-4.VI.7-8; T-19.IV-D.11). The Course's means for us to remember God is to practice forgiveness in our special relationships, which allows them to be experienced as holy (T-18.VII.5:1-3). If they were already holy, we would not need to forgive them. And if we were to give them up, we would have no classroom in which to learn the Holy Spirit's lessons of forgiveness. As Jesus reminds us, \"Only appreciation is an appropriate response to your brother. Gratitude is due him for both his loving thoughts and his appeals for help, for both are capable of bringing love into your awareness if you perceive them truly. And all your sense of strain comes from your attempts not to do just this. How simple, then, is God's plan for salvation\" (T-12.I.6:1-4)."

I am very judgmental about how the rest of the family reacts: some don't ever want to hear anything bad. I am dealing with my feelings of going to Jesus constantly and trying to understand that he is my teacher, and this is the classroom I have chosen. I don't get any relief from my anxiety about her condition. I just say to myself that I need do nothing, for really there is nothing I can do. It is difficult to go  on with my daily life, many miles away from the situation, without thinking of this situation constantly, even waking up in the earliest morning hours thinking about it. I feel that it is the ego saying to me, \"So you think you are going to be peaceful now and relax and let others live their lives and not be bothered by it. How about this new situation!\" How can it be that the ego seems more real than Jesus? Though I know it is not.",
    "output": "The process of having the ego become less real and Jesus more real usually extends over many, many years. A great deal of patience is required, a process he describes in the manual of A Course in Miracles in the section called \"Development of Trust\" (M-4.I). When we first start asking for help, we are not all that aware of what is involved, especially the depth of our fear of letting go of the ego totally, and having the love of Jesus be the only reality in our minds. It seems as if we truly want that more than anything, but there must be something in the way, otherwise the ego would just vanish. So as we go along, we begin to get in touch with the obstacles, and how we probably are secretly asking for a compromise: we want the love of Jesus, but we also want a happy, problem-free life here in the world, where things like cancer don't happen or are cured quickly. That is why Jesus so often in the early workbook lessons directs us to search our minds for thoughts we have covered over or locked away beyond reach. We all say we want to develop a relationship with Jesus, but we have secretly set up our own terms for the relationship instead of coming to him with empty hands and altars cleared of all expectations and demands. Jesus would want you to bring to him your judgments about your family and all of your anxiety and sense of helplessness about your sister, so that together you can look at it all quietly and calmly from a perspective above the world's complexity and despair. You shift from the seeming reality of the ego to the love of Jesus simply by learning to look at the ego without judging it, being afraid of it, or trying to drown it out with right-minded thoughts. The ego becomes less real as you practice more and more being at peace within yourself (without denying your feelings) whatever the outcome of your sister's situation. This is a very difficult lesson to learn, and no one finds it easy. But Jesus assures us that we cannot fail to learn it, and that his love is totally unaffected by whatever the ego throws up at us--its seeming power cannot even stop the fall of a button, he tells us (T-18.IX.6:4). Hear him say to you and your sister: \"Have faith in only this one thing, and it will be sufficient: God wills you be in Heaven, and nothing can keep you from it, or it from you. Your wildest misperceptions, your weird imaginings, your blackest nightmares all mean nothing. They will not prevail against the peace God wills for you\" (T- 13.XI.7:1-3). What is so extraordinarily helpful about this passage, besides its comforting reassurance, is that Jesus is telling us that he knows about our thoughts, our discouragement, our craziness, and our resistance, but none of that matters to him. The lesson is that we learn to trust that all of our mad ego attacks are nothing but attempts to hide the love underneath that is our permanent identity. The more we approach the ego this way, the more we are telling Jesus that we know his love is more real than the ego."

We can speak in symbols and metaphors, but the truth of Who we are is beyond all such feeble-minded attempts to portray what is beyond portrayal. There is no relationship between our experience here within the split mind and our reality as God's one Son, complete and whole and undifferentiated, in Heaven. There is a memory of oneness, which at best allows us to recognize that something is not right here and that there is Something else to which we yearn to return. But even the notion of return is an illusion, since we have never in reality left (T- 6.II.11:1-2). How then can we possibly understand reality when our experience so clearly seems to contradict the truth? The one Mind has not gone mad--It remains unchanged. What seems to be many is only illusion, a dreamlike state that creates a cacophony of discordant notes that seem to have replaced the harmonious single note of Heaven's pure melody but have only covered it over, or seem to have covered it over. There is no path that will allow us to trace our experience here as seemingly separate fragments back to the oneness that is our reality because they are totally discontinuous states, one real and one false. Reality has not changed and the separation bears absolutely no relationship to it. In the end, we will simply release all of our thoughts and questions and concepts, and truth will for a fleeting moment seem to fill the void. And our one Life will continue on, uninterrupted and uninterruptible, as it always has."

I like calculus and physics and find myself working on problems for the joy of the exercise. It is one of the pleasures of the illusion and, yes, it keeps me rooted very much in this world. Yet there is the promise of oneness but it does not motivate me enough to practice the silence on a regular basis.",
    "output": "It sounds as if you may be confusing the Course with other spiritual paths. There would be nothing within the disciplines of calculus or physics that in themselves would be at odds with the teachings of the Course. All the forms of the world, once we find ourselves within the illusion, are neutral. The only question the Course encourages us to ask is what purpose will we give them (T-4.V.6:4-11). And there are only two alternatives: the ego's purpose of separation (T-11.V.7) and the Holy Spirit's purpose of forgiveness (T-25.III.5:1-3). So, for example, if you use working on calculus or physics problems as a way of avoiding someone with whom you are having difficulty, escaping into the mental activity to push away uncomfortable or unpleasant feelings, your purpose would be to maintain the separation. In contrast, if you saw the simple elegance of the solution to a particular calculus or physics problem as a reminder of the simplicity that we all share as God's one Son, your purpose would be forgiveness or healing. The primary practice of the Course is not meditation or contemplation, but forgiveness (T- 18.VII.4-6). The Course more clearly than most other spiritual paths not only acknowledges but explains our resistance to the oneness, and does not judge us for it. It is not that God has chosen to keep Himself hidden from us but that we have chosen to hide from Him, out of fear of His retribution for our perceived sinfulness. And so, rather than a direct approach to the truth and oneness that many other paths embrace, represented by meditative and contemplative practices, the Course offers an indirect approach that focuses on undoing--forgiveness--rather than doing (T-14.I.4-5). So simply recognizing your resistance to the oneness and not judging yourself for it would be putting the Course's principles into practice. And becoming more aware of the purpose you have chosen for everything in your life, including but not limited to your favorite pursuits, will allow you to make a different choice when you recognize you have given them the ego's purpose."

A Course in Miracles says that everything happens as a result of thought and not action. I believe that my true work is in something that I have always loved and it has never left me! Could it be because I haven't found a \"regular job\" that I am supposed to go do my dream work? That if I just start doing it and trusting in the Holy Spirit for guidance that it will manifest? I am feeling rather lost and frustrated and like a loser because nothing has come about yet, but many small things regarding what I really want to do have shown up. Lesson 64 states that God just wants me to be happy because that is my function. I guess the question is, if I keep thinking about what I want, will it actually manifest itself?",
    "output": "The Course does teach that \"all thinking produces form at some level\" (T-2.VI.9:14). But its purpose is not to teach us how to use our thinking to control or produce the forms we think we want. Rather, the Course's goal is to help us learn that we can find no real happiness in anything of the world (T-31.IV). Now if you feel drawn to a certain type of work, and events seem to support your heading in that direction, by all means go for it, for there is nothing to be lost by pursuing your dreams. However, what is to be gained may not be quite what you're thinking it is. Contrary to most people's beliefs about their experience in the world, the Course's position is that nothing in the world can make us either happy or unhappy. And whatever dreams we are drawn to more than likely represent some form of specialness that will allow us to cover over, at least temporarily, the guilt we all carry buried in our minds over our belief in separation, so that it can't be healed. But such situations also provide valuable opportunities to learn our lessons of forgiveness if we accept the Holy Spirit's guidance. This does not mean you should not take whatever joy or pleasure you may find in following what you believe to be your true work. But as a student of the Course, you want at least to be aware that all things of the world are double-edged; that is, they can seem to be the cause of pain as well as pleasure. And this is where the Holy Spirit's guidance can be most helpful. For His role is not to direct us in our life's decisions but rather to help us learn how to use whatever our life circumstances are to practice forgiveness. This is what Lesson 64 means when it says \"that the Holy Spirit has another use for all the illusions you have made, and therefore He sees another purpose in them. To the Holy Spirit, the world is a place where you learn to forgive yourself what you think of as your sins. In this perception, the physical appearance of temptation becomes the spiritual recognition of salvation\" (W-pI.64.2:2-4). In other words, His purpose is to help us awaken from the dream, not make it a happier dream, by using what we have made for separation and specialness as a means for healing. So when you say that God wants us to be happy, it is important to be clear that this lesson is saying we can be truly happy only if we forgive and do not seek for happiness in situations and circumstances outside ourselves. As Lesson 64 clearly states: \"The purpose of the world you see is to obscure your function of forgiveness ... Only by fulfilling the function given you by God will you be happy. That is because your function is to be happy by using the means [forgiveness] by which happiness becomes inevitable. There is no other way. Therefore, every time you choose whether or not to fulfill your function, you are really choosing whether or not to be happy\" (W-pI.64.1:2; 4:1-4, italics added)."

    "text_input": "Q #525: Recently a friend of mine did something that really hurt my feelings. I've been trying to forgive him but I can't seem to get the incident out of my mind. So I went to the workbook section that begins with \"What is Forgiveness\" for a remedy. I didn't get beyond the first sentence: \"Forgiveness recognizes what you thought your brother did to you has not occurred.\" Would you please try to clarify what is meant by \"never occurred\" or \"what didn't happen\"?",
    "output": "Whatever occurred in form between you and your friend did take place. The workbook is not advocating denial of our experience in the dream. What your friend did not do is take your peace away, nor cause the feelings you may have. That can happen only as the result of a choice in the mind to choose against peace, by choosing to believe the separation is real. This means choosing the ego as teacher, accepting the ego's interpretation of what occurs in the dream of separation. Basic to the ego thought system is the belief that external circumstances are the cause of internal conflict. A Course in Miracles calls this magic and upside-down thinking. The miracle, on the other hand, is recognizing that nothing external has any effect on our peace. One of the most important goals of the Course, if not the most important goal, is to teach us that we have a mind with the power to choose. It is this power to choose that is the foundation of the cause and effect principle. The line you quote from the workbook is one of the many ways the Course teaches this principle. You thought your brother caused you to be upset, by hurting you. That is not what happened. What did happen is that prior to any external event with your friend, you made a choice in your mind to identify with the ego by believing you are a separate individual in a body, rather than an innocent Son of God who is spirit, as God created you. That is where you really were. Guilt at having made this choice is projected outside of the mind in the form of reactions to all the upsetting situations encountered in relationships and the world. When we attack our true Identity as the Son of God by identifying with the ego, we cannot but be hurt by everyone and everything in the dream. We are literally \"under attack,\" but it is our own attack, as Jesus tells us in the text: \"All attack is Self attack. It cannot be anything else. Arising from your own decision not to be what you are, it is an attack on your identification. Attack is thus the way in which your identification is lost, because when you attack, you must have forgotten what you are\" (T-10.II.5:1-4). If a choice in the mind is the cause of how we feel, then we cannot be the victim of people or circumstances outside of the mind (W-pI.31); we cannot be hurt by anything external. Therefore: \"There is nothing to forgive. No one can hurt the Son of God\" (T-14.III.7:5-6). Forgiveness begins with the willingness to recognize this process and see the mind as the true cause of your hurt, not your brother. Accepting that you cannot be hurt is the kindness of forgiveness offered to yourself, as well as to your friend. See also #272, #472."

Only content can be consistent, and that has nothing to do with theology or metaphysics.

And he acknowledges that those seeking controversy within the Course's teachings will find it (C-in.2-3). So a spiritual teacher, coming from a tradition and a set of symbols and myths very different from the Course's, inevitably will assert things inconsistent with or even contradictory to the Course's teachings. And what are we to do about these seemingly paradoxical assertions? The answer lies not within an analysis of the various forms of the teachings but rather with an honest assessment of your own response to the teachings, recognizing that not everyone will have the same response. The ego thought system is one of fragmentation and differentiation. Since the Holy Spirit uses for healing what the ego has made for separation, we will each work within the set of differentiated symbols that are personally most meaningful to us. Jesus recognizes this at the beginning of the manual when he observes that \"this is a manual for a special curriculum, intended for teachers of a special form of the universal course. There are many thousands of other forms, all with the same outcome\" (M-1.4:1-2). For the key in one's search for a spiritual path is not to find the truth out there--it's not out there (with apologies to X-files aficionados)--but to be open to finding and following the path to which you personally resonate, that speaks to you in the symbols and metaphors that make sense to you. None of them is real, so all that matters is that you recognize the path that will serve you as a means ultimately to move beyond all form and symbols, even if you do not recognize that purpose when you first come to the teaching. For this reason, it makes no sense to try to persuade anyone else of the truth or falsity of any spiritual teaching. In the end, the only thing that can be true is that which transcends all symbols, all theologies, all metaphysical systems. Many paths lead to the same experience of oneness, but that does not mean that they are interchangeable for the individual. So respect rather than judge other paths, but don't forget that your goal is to find what will serve you best and then follow it. Anything else, including debating different theologies, is \"a defense against the truth in the form of a delaying maneuver\" (C-in.2:3)."

    "output": "It's not only because you gave yourself a name and an identity, but what you believe you had to do to God in order to accomplish it, that explains why you--and everyone else here--feels terrible, worthless and unreal. In Heaven, there are no individual names and everyone shares the same Identity as Christ, God's only Son. It is the desire for something else and the willingness to do whatever it takes to bring that something else about--including the destruction of God and His All-encompassing Love--that is the origin of our guilt and self-hatred. But in reality, God and our true Self remain unaffected. So even the feelings of worthlessness are nothing more than part of what we have chosen to experience to convince ourselves that we are separate. Making up a self with its own individual identity and name is just one further step in our insane attempt to prove we've done the impossible. But down deep we know it's all a lie, and so feelings of fraudulent deception and unreality must lie underneath our sense of self here in the world. Everything we then attempt to do in the world to counter our feelings of unworthiness and falsity only serves to reinforce those underlying, unquestioned beliefs about ourselves. The ego is indeed very clever! This is why we need help from outside our thought system to be released from our self-imposed delusions. You have part of the answer when you ask if we need only to look at what we have made. Anything more than looking, any attempt at intervention, makes our attack on God real and only reinforces the ego's purpose of maintaining guilt and separation. So we look, not by ourselves, but with the part of our mind--A Course in Miracles calls it Jesus or the Holy Spirit-- that knows our self is a lie but it is not a sin. And through that joined looking we can begin to question those underlying beliefs about ourselves and decide whether they really are serving our genuine best interests. The answer--if we look honestly and nonjudgmentally--is that they are not. Once we have begun to examine and then release those false judgments, we can then ask the Holy Spirit to replace them with a different perception of ourselves and everyone else, a true reflection of our reality as Christ."

Surprisingly, I find myself always remembering that \"this, too, will pass\" and I just do my level best to cope. With this in mind, I can see situations at the far end of it, being solved and forgotten. In the same way, I remind my staff to discuss and handle problems with the vendors' right mind with their own right minds. I hear how thankful they are about the new approach I suggested. My question is, how can I sustain handling problems this way, with little worry and faith that all will be well at the end? How can this faith be lived by, without waiver, canceling out all other needs, living in me for the rest of my life in this classroom? Does my thinking I'll have difficulty sustaining it mean that I still have little faith? Or must I continue to meet more \"problematic situations\" like these while believing that I have real problems to solve?",
    "output": "As A Course in Miracles itself alludes to in many places, mastery of its principles and their application is a process (e.g., W-pII.284; M-14). Our understanding of its teachings will necessarily progress through a series of levels as we develop a deeper sense of what it is telling us about the nature of forgiveness and who we truly are, which are closely related. This progression to deeper levels proceeds as we undo false concepts and beliefs about ourselves through practicing forgiveness at whatever level we are ready to understand and accept it. So be patient with yourself. How the process appears to you in this present moment may not be how it will seem to you at some point in the future. Yet there is great value in continuing to step back and release your judgments about how things in the present should be. And you may ask yourself if there are other situations, perhaps outside the work setting, in your personal life, from which you may be withholding the application of these principles. For, when Jesus reminds us that we don't really know our own best interests (W-pI.24), he is including our entire life as we experience it. He is asking us simply to trust the process of forgiveness and generalize it to all areas of our lives. The rest will follow. As he clarifies in the introduction to the workbook, which can be applied to the process of forgiveness, which after all is what the lessons are attempting to teach us: \"You are merely asked to apply the ideas as you are directed to do. You are not asked to judge them at all. You are asked only to use them. It is their use that will give them meaning to you, and will show you that they are true ... But do not allow yourself to make exceptions in applying the ideas ... and whatever your reactions to the ideas may be, use them. Nothing more than that is required\" (W-in.8:3-6; 9:4-5)."

    "text_input": "Q #530: A Course in Miracles states \"seek not to change the world, but choose to change your mind about the world\" (T-21.in.1:7). Does this mean not to take a political or environmental stance? For instance, should we not sign a petition that opposes practices that are damaging to  the environment, or work for political causes that are in opposition to the current political agenda? If the world is illusion, should we not care, or should we try to create a \"happy dream\"?",
    "output": "In A Course in Miracles Jesus teaches on different levels. Since the Course tells us the world does not exist-- \"There is no world! This is the central thought the course attempts to teach\" (W- pI.132.6:2-3), it would be inconsistent with this teaching to give any instruction regarding behavior. The Course neither encourages nor discourages any specific form of activity in the dream. However, while it gives us a whole new perspective on the world, not the least of which includes the fact that the world does not exist, it also tells us: \"You dream of a separated ego and believe in a world that rests upon it. This is very real to you. You cannot undo it by not changing your mind about it\" (T-4.I.4:4-6). Thus the Course acknowledges that we do believe in our experience as bodies in the physical world, and it is very clear in cautioning us not to deny this experience: \" ... it is almost impossible to deny its [body] existence in this world. Those who do so are engaging in a particularly unworthy form of denial\" (T-2.IV.3:10-11). It is precisely this belief in our identity as bodies in the world that needs to be healed through forgiveness. Participating in political and environmental causes is no different from any of the other things we do: caring for the body, working at a job, playing golf. All these things make up the classroom where we practice forgiveness. If you are interested in political causes and feel inclined to some specific action, there is no reason not to pursue your interest. The difference for those who practice the Course is to have any activity, and the relationships that go with it, transformed to serve the Holy Spirit's purpose of healing, rather than the ego's goal of specialness. This process requires the willingness to look at all the judgments we bring to everything that we do. It is important to see all the ways we take sides, judge those who do not share our concerns, and find the \"sinners\" in any situation so they can be blamed for the mess we seem to be in. In these observations we have the opportunity to see how we make the world real by trying to fix it, instead of taking responsibility for the thought of separation that perpetuates it in our awareness. That is how we are meant to \"change our minds about the world.\" It is also important to remember that none of the activities or causes we may engage in is more worthy or spiritual than any other. The only \"spiritual\" thing we do is forgive. The \"happy dream\" is experienced in the mind, not in the world. While still in the dream, it is an awareness that it is a dream and not reality. Then, whether you get involved or not, whether the whales are saved or not, you remain at peace in the knowledge that your truth has not been affected by the insanity of the ego's lie of separation."

The line appears in the first section, \"The Dream of Fear.\" The section's fourth paragraph talks about how the world and God differ in all respects: \"Does God deceive or does the world? For it is sure that one must lie. There is no point at which their thoughts agree, their gifts unite in kind or purpose. What you take from one the other will obscure. There is no hope of compromise in this.\" I'm having trouble understanding the meaning in the line, \"What you take from one the other will obscure.\"",
    "output": "This line simply means that the effects of a choice for either God or the ego can not be experienced in the presence of the other. The ego will obscure or hide from our awareness the gifts of peace and love that God offers us. But likewise, a choice for God will replace the ego's offerings of sin, guilt and fear with His gifts of love and peace, banishing the ego along with its gifts back into nothingness. We can only hold one in our awareness in any moment and the choice is ours. God and the ego are mutually exclusive and the choice is between one or the other. Near the end of the next paragraph in the poem, this idea is expressed again: \"Do not think that fear can enter where His gifts abide. But do not think gifts can be received where fear has entered ... There are no scraps of dreams. Each one contains the whole of fear, the opposite of love, the hell that hides the memory of God ... and hell is total.\" And this same idea is reflected in Jesus' statement in A Course in Miracles that \"you cannot give up Heaven partially. You cannot be a little bit in hell\" (M-13.7:3-4)."

    "text_input": "Q #532: The manual for teachers of A Course in Miracles says that sometimes we are guided to say something from the Holy Spirit that may \"confront the teacher with a situation that appears to be greatly embarrassing.\" I have had this experience lately and more and more as I practice forgiveness and learn to give up judgment I am able to let Jesus speak through me and sometimes I am indeed guided to say something that really is totally irrelevant and has nothing to do with what is going on in the situation. My question is: Why would the Holy Spirit want to put us in a situation that is embarrassing to us? Why would he want us not to feel comfortable? I sometimes feel like people look at me like I am crazy when I say something from my right mind, something that I don't even understand until later. I am seeing as time goes on that the Holy Spirit will say something through me and then I will not understand the depth of what I just said until later! But how does this relate to others?",
    "output": "This is one of those passages our egos would like to run with and interpret as evidence that the Holy Spirit does not really have our own best interests at heart. After all, you ask, why would the Holy Spirit want to put us in a situation that is embarrassing to us? But that is not really what this passage is saying. Embarrassment is an ego reaction that comes when our separate self feels threatened because we are not defending and protecting it. It is not the Holy Spirit's intention to place us in embarrassing circumstances, although we may feel embarrassed when we set our ego aside momentarily and are willing to practice forgiveness, which is a thought of nonjudgmental defenselessness. That thought is first accepted into our minds and then may be expressed in words (or actions) that reflect a recognition of our shared interest and basic equality with all our brothers and sisters. This kind of acknowledgment can be embarrassing to an ego that always wants to come out on top, even when it adopts a false humility that seems to place us below others. If you re-read this passage, you will see that Jesus says that what we hear \"may also seem to be quite irrelevant to the presented problem as he perceives it, and may, in fact, confront the teacher with a situation that appears to be very embarrassing to him. All these are judgments that have no value. They are his own, coming from a shabby self-perception which he would leave behind (M-21.5:3-5; italics added). In other words, the embarrassment is not in any way intrinsic to the situation but comes from our ego-based interpretations of who we think we are and what we think is acceptable for maintaining our self-esteem. And self-esteem is nothing more than an ego function that we believe is necessary to defend against our underlying sense of shame and guilt--our \"shabby self-perception.\" As for whether we are hearing and speaking the words of Jesus or the Holy Spirit, it is probably best not to spend much time assessing whether the source in any specific situation is our right mind or our ego. Our ego, after all, can get pretty good at offering its own imitation of the Holy Spirit, expressing the form of \"spirituality\" but the content of separation. If you keep your focus on being aware of your own judgments and asking for help in releasing them whenever you are aware that they have arisen, then you will have done your part in getting yourself out of the way so that Jesus can manifest his loving presence through you. And should you find yourself embarrassed at anything you find yourself saying or doing, simply know that your ego's interpretations and judgments have again supplanted the Holy Spirit's gentle forgiveness in your awareness and you simply need to ask for His help again. It is not so much that the Holy Spirit will guide us to make deep and profound statements but that we will be speaking words that will remind us that we are all truly the same, that the differences between us that the ego would like to emphasize, the Holy Spirit sees as irrelevant. Remembering that is what is truly helpful to everyone, and not the specific words we may find ourselves speaking."

    "text_input": "Q #533: I have been studying A Course in Miracles for over 10 years now, with a few extended breaks from it. I am doing the lessons again for a second time and they seem to be stirring the mud more than the first time as regards experiencing fear. You have answered many questions about fear and I am hoping you would have some tried and true responses in dealing with it.",
    "output": "Perhaps one of the most helpful things to remember in dealing with our fear is that it is always a result of our choice, no matter what our experience may tell us to the contrary. Here are a few of the many passages in the Course that make this clear (italics added). In speaking of the ego and the Holy Spirit: \" ... there are no other guides but these to choose between, and no other outcomes possible as a result of your choice but the fear that the ego always engenders, and the love that the Holy Spirit always offers to replace it\" (W-pI.66.7:5). \"No one can grieve nor fear nor think him sick unless these are the outcomes that he wants\" (W-pI.152.1:3). And \"Is not the escape of God's beloved Son from evil dreams that he imagines, yet believes are true, a worthy purpose? Who could hope for more, while there appears to be a choice to make between success and failure; love and fear? (W-pI.200.6:5-6). Most of the time, the choice is unconscious, but one of the goals of the Course is to help us become more aware of the decision, so we can make a different one. And one of the ways to make the choice more conscious is to understand why we would choose fear. Fear serves a very important ego purpose, validating the reality of the separation in our experience. Fear affirms my existence as a separate being, threatened by forces outside myself. The feeling denies that I could possibly be one with my Source, beyond which there is nothing else. It really does not matter what I attribute my fear to, so long as I do not seriously question the reality of the danger to myself. Although we experience fear towards all sorts of seemingly external forces in the world outside of us, the Course makes it clear that these are merely the result of the projection of the fear buried in our mind over the punishment--certain death--we believe we deserve for attacking God and destroying Heaven. But the deeper fear--once we begin to accept that we've made up the fear of punishment and death in alliance with the ego to keep us mindless and are really attracted to it (T-19.IV-B,C)--is the fear of love. For in the presence of total love, there are no differences, no distinctions and no individual identities. Our fear of love is addressed in a number of passages, but no where is more clearly presented than in the beginning of \"The Fear of Redemption\": \"We have said that no one will countenance fear if he recognizes it. Yet in your disordered state of mind you are not afraid of fear. You do not like it, but it is not your desire to attack that really frightens you. You are not seriously disturbed by your hostility. You keep it hidden because you are more afraid of what it covers. You could look even upon the ego's darkest cornerstone without fear if you did not believe that, without the ego, you would find within yourself something you fear even more. You are not really afraid of crucifixion. Your real terror is of redemption. Under the ego's dark foundation is the memory of God, and it is of this that you are really afraid. For this memory would instantly restore you to your proper place, and it is this place that you have sought to leave. Your fear of attack is nothing compared to your fear of love. You would be willing to look even upon your savage wish to kill God's Son, if you did not believe that it saves you from love. For this wish caused the separation, and you have protected it because you do not want the separation healed\" (T-13.III.1:4-11; 2:1-5). So to acknowledge the depth of our fear is helpful, but we also want to recognize that in our minds it serves as a powerful defense, protecting the identity that we cling to while we are too afraid to let go. And there is no pressure to let go. As Jesus assures us, \"Fear not that you will be abruptly lifted up and hurled into reality\" (T-16.VI.8:1). So as you move through the layers of your fear, remember to include Jesus in the looking process, for his presence is a reminder that fear is a choice, that it serves a very useful ego purpose, and, most importantly, all the seeming reasons for our fear are made up and have no basis in anything real. We don't believe that yet, but he knows it's true. You mention that many questions have already addressed the issue of fear. Here are some of them: #95, #242, #267, #355 and #384."

    "text_input": "Q #534: I have heard it said that A Course in Miracles says that we should \"bring the illusion to the truth\" rather than try to create a better illusion by trying to \"bring the truth to the illusion.\" However, I was reading yesterday in the text, Chapter 18, Section VIII, \"The Little Garden,\" which may be saying something different. In paragraph 9 it says, \"The Thought of God surrounds your little kingdom [ego illusion], waiting at the barrier you built [separation] to come inside and shine upon the barren ground. See how life springs up everywhere! The desert becomes a garden, green and deep and quiet, offering rest to those who lost their way and wander in the dust ... \" This seems to suggest that when we offer up our lives to the Holy Spirit for guidance, the desert of our lives becomes a garden? Could this process be thought of as \"bringing truth to the illusion,\" resulting in an experience of what the Course calls a happy dream? Is this what the Course asks us to do?",
    "output": "Sorry, but much as our egos would like to have us believe it's so, Jesus is never saying anything about changing the external world or our seeming lives as separate bodies in that world, since there is no external world. As he says elsewhere, this world is an hallucination (T- 20.VIII.7:3), so it's unlikely that he would want to help us make a better hallucination. Jesus is only speaking of mind and, in this passage, the little part of the mind we believe we have barricaded from God and set up as our own autonomous kingdom. When we are willing to stop \"protecting\" the little self that we believe we have split off from God through our thoughts of judgment and attack, then the love that is always there can flow through, shifting our perception from one of desolation and lack to one of joy and abundance. When we offer our judgments (not our lives) to the Holy Spirit, we drop the barriers around our separate self. And to release those judgments to Him, we must first have looked at them and acknowledged our investment in them. And this is the process of bringing our illusions to the truth (T-17.I.5), so the truth can shine on the illusion and allow the love to replace the sin and guilt and fear. It is this kind of inner shift that Jesus is describing metaphorically through the imagery of the garden replacing the desert. Whether there will be some kind of corresponding shift in the images we are projecting from the mind will not matter to us, for we will share Jesus' understanding that none of it is real."

First it says past, present and future are not continuous. Then it says that I would destroy time's continuity. How can I destroy time's continuity if it is not continuous? Or, am I misreading this paragraph?",
    "output": "The key is in understanding that the ego and the Holy Spirit perceive the purpose of illusory time exactly the opposite (T-13.IV.7:1-2) and so each focuses on different aspects of time: the ego on the past and future; the Holy Spirit on the present. The ego wants to keep us trapped in the illusion of time for that keeps the ego alive. And so it attempts to establish an artificial continuity or link between the illusory past and the illusory future through guilt and fear, which makes time real in our experience. The ego literally ignores the present except as a fleeting moment in time that links the past and the future, with the future a fearful and inevitable continuation of the sinful, guilty past, with no hope of escape (T-5.VI.2:1-4; T-13.I.8; T- 13.IV.8). The Holy Spirit, in contrast, seeks to help us move beyond the illusion of time and so uses the present, the only aspect of time that approximates eternity, to extend to the infinite (T-13.IV.7:3- 7; T-13.VI.6). The past's only value is that it can be undone through forgiveness, transforming it and purifying it so that it no longer conflicts with the present (T-17.III.5). For the Holy Spirit, the holy instant, the present moment, is one continuous instant without interruption or ending, which is the bridge between time and timelessness. If we do not experience its continuity, it is only because we have accepted the ego's interpretation of time, which attempts to impose an artificial continuity between a sinful past that has never happened and a future of punishment and pain that is nothing more than a sick fantasy (W-pI.135.16)."

    "text_input": "Q #536: Many times A Course in Miracles tells us to let go of our judgments and allow the Holy Spirit to guide us. It says that if we allow the Holy Spirit to guide us, all of our needs will be met. It also explains that \"needs\" means seeming needs that we perceive while we are still in illusion. It also says that we must awaken in peace. By this I understand it to mean that we cannot awaken from a dream of terror but first we must allow the Holy Spirit to guide us from our fearful dream to a \"happy dream.\" Then, we can awaken. Do I understand this correctly? How can we be sure we are not following the guidance of the ego's judgments and mistaking them for the real Holy Spirit's guidance?",
    "output": "Your understanding is basically correct, provided you do not mean that you expect all your seeming worldly needs to be met so long as you follow the Holy Spirit's guidance. For if you do, you will be setting yourself up for certain disappointment. There are a few passages in the Course where the language seems to suggest this kind of Providential provision for our needs (e.g., T-20.IV.8, but see also #293), but these are intended as comforting passages to reassure us that God loves us and does not want to punish or hurt us in any way, as the ego would have us believe. As we come to understand the level of mind at which the Course is written, it becomes apparent that Jesus is referring to the obstacles and perceived needs in the mind, not in the body, which after all is only a lifeless projection of the thoughts of scarcity and need in the mind. As for your question about hearing the Holy Spirit, His guidance is always and only to forgive (T-25.VI.5:3-6; W-pI.99.9:6-8; W-pII.1.5:1). And that does not require us to do anything. Rather it asks us to undo our judgments of attack and condemnation. Anything specific that we might say or do following that release of judgment is simply the form that our own minds, joined with the Holy Spirit, then give to the experience of love and peace that flow through our minds when we are not restricting their extension by our desire for something else. So long as you accept that your role is simply to recognize your ego's judgments and be willing to let them go, you need not concern yourself with anything else. You will be following the Holy Spirit's guidance. Your concern about distinguishing between the ego's and the Holy Spirit's guidance has also been addressed in other Questions, including #43, #285, and #309."

And A Course in Miracles teaches disease is the effect of our belief of our guilt. So while guilt couldn't be contagious, how could a student of the Course think rightly about, talk rightly about, and act rightly about the STD of herpes?",
    "output": "While guilt is not contagious, it inevitably leads to the expectation of punishment. Following the ego's plan, as a defense against the agony over this guilt and fear in our minds we deny the mind and its contents and wind up believing we are bodies in a world with laws of its own. (See W-pI.76.8 where Jesus lists some of these laws.) By choice, then, we (decision-making minds outside time and space) subject ourselves to these laws and block any awareness of the dynamics going on in our minds, which are the foundation of our experiences in the world. The whole thing is a setup, but if we are convinced that we are bodies, we had better pay attention to these so-called laws. Yes, it is true that disease is ultimately caused by our belief in the reality of guilt, but while we are working on that level, which is a step in the right direction, we cannot ignore or deny our bodily experiences, nor does Jesus think it is a good idea to do so (T-2.IV.3:8-11). You single out herpes, but would you drink from a cup just used by someone with the flu? Would you accept blood from a donor known to have the AIDS virus? Would you allow your child to play with another child who just came down with the measles? Would you eat at a restaurant where the food preparers have hepatitis? The point, again, is that if you believe you are a body, it is just common sense to do what normal people do in the world to protect themselves and others--but without making a big deal about it. This is the compromise approach Jesus himself recommends (the reference to Chapter 2 above)."

    "text_input": "Q #538: A student has raised the question of whether we have a specific role to play in this world, and your answer was: not in the world, but in our minds. However, the Holy Spirit does help us \"in the illusion,\" and there are several references in A Course in Miracles to specific roles and certain people we are supposed to meet, etc. The Course is also made within the framework of the illusion. I think you are doing a great job--always giving wise answers, but in this case I do think you should discuss it further within your organization.",
    "output": "We are aware of the passages you refer to and that the Course comes within an ego framework (C-in.3:1). There is no doubt that people receive very specific guidance--Helen Schucman, scribe of the Course, did. It is not wrong or harmful, as Jesus says in The Song of Prayer, but he clearly says that we will do much if we can get beyond that level, which he invites us to do (S-1.I). Helen learned that later, and then no longer related to Jesus that way. (Chapter 17 in Kenneth's book Absence from Felicity contains a very helpful exposition of this dimension of Jesus' teaching and Helen's transition to this level.) Then, too, Jesus is emphatic about our always taking into consideration the purpose of what we do. He tells us early in the workbook that we do not know what anything is for (W-pI.25); the purposes we recognize are all at a superficial level, where purpose cannot really be understood, he states, using the example of contacting someone by telephone (4:2-3). The relevance of this to your question is that we would not know what specific roles or relationships are truly for, and therefore we would impose our own meaning on them, which more than likely would be of the ego--whereas the only meaning of value in anything we do is forgiveness. Therefore, the Holy Spirit's guidance would be exclusively for the content of forgiveness. The form in which that content is expressed then becomes essentially irrelevant. Our recorded workshop \"Making the Holy Spirit Special\" provides a detailed exposition of this crucial issue. Interest in specifics is the stage of spiritual childhood, the beginning of a very long spiritual process that is aimed at helping us reach the top of the ladder where specifics become meaningless, including our specific identity as individuals. Referring again to the first section in the companion pamphlet to the Course, Jesus says that what we truly want is the song itself, nothing but God's Love. That is the real content of the answers we experience as specific guidance. He is training us to gravitate more to that content, rather than the form of the answer. We tend to fall in love with the specialness of receiving specific guidance and thereby miss the content, which is what would make us happy and peaceful all the time, regardless of external conditions. It is in this spirit that Jesus asks the rhetorical questions: \"What could His answer be but your remembrance of Him? Can this be traded for a bit of trifling advice about a problem of an instant's duration? God answers only for eternity\" (S-I.4:5-7). Granted, Jesus' perspective far transcends ours when he appeals to us this way, but all he is doing is inviting us to join him there because he knows how much more at peace we would be, and because that is where we truly belong. So these two levels of Jesus' teaching must be kept in sight if one is to learn and use this Course as it was meant to be learned and used. When we focus on specifics it is as if we are holding up a thimble to receive the love that cannot be contained by any form. We are not aware that what we are secretly doing is trying to make love conform to our specifications, when the reality is that \"its total lack of limit is its meaning\" (T-18.VIII.8:2). Jesus thus appeals to us not to stay on the level of specifics, not because it is wrong or sinful to stay there, but because we are selling ourselves short. This world is not our home, he tells us in many ways throughout the Course, so why would we want to limit his help to our problems and aspirations in the world? He wants rather to help us identify the ways in which we keep ourselves alienated from our true Home and our true Identity. We did not even know that this is what our lives here were all about; now we do, and we have a teacher who will be with us each step of the way, from the beginning of the journey when we are interested mainly in his help with our lives in the world, to the completion of the journey when we experience our oneness with each other: \"And thus you joined with me, so what I am are you as well\" (W-pII.14.2:3). So when we see Jesus only as the one who can help us with our problems, unbeknownst to ourselves, we are limiting the relationship with him that he would so dearly like us to have."

    "text_input": "Q #539: I have recently reviewed some of the sites on A Course in Miracles and wonder if it is they who are misunderstanding the Course or I. I understand that God created the universe and the heavens and earth and within that the Garden. Sin could be seen as a result of Adam and Eve's lack of love and their sense of shame for actions they did. This shame was the first illusion followed by many misunderstandings and illusions for many generations, the creation of the world as we know it, but not as God knows it and wants us to know it. Out of compassion God entered the \"world of our illusions\" through the human Jesus who was born seeing as God sees, and he taught us the Way out of our illusion \"back\" to the Kingdom of Heaven. If those statements are true then he was saying that we cannot see the world as God sees so we must  follow the WAY he has taught us and change our hearts. Is that what the Course teaches or am I mistaken? If it is, then I really can't see the conflict with the Course and the biblical teachings of Jesus in the Gospels.",
    "output": "Although the Course uses the language of the Bible, including references to Adam and the Garden of Eden (T-2.I.3:1-6; 4:5; T-3.I.3:9), the symbolism behind its use of these words is very different from the Bible's. The Course aims to correct the basic teachings of Christianity and Judaism found in their scriptures, predicated as they are on the reality of sin and the need to do something about it; i.e., God sends His only Son into the world to make the perfect sacrifice. The Course's uncompromising position is that we could only seem to dream that we have acted against God and therefore there are no actions that could in any way be misconstrued as sin or attack. Direct corrections of biblical statements and principles can be found in a number of text sections, including \"Atonement without Sacrifice\" (T-3.I) and \"Time and Eternity\" (T-5.VI). But the fundamental difference is that the Bible--and this characterizes your understanding as well, as you present it above--teaches that God created the world as something apart from Himself, and breathed life into separate beings with individual forms distinct from Himself. The Course, in contrast, teaches a pure non-dualism that says that God can only create or extend like Himself (e.g., T-24.VII.7) and that anything that is not like God--which includes the world of form and everything contained within it--can not be His creation and therefore cannot be real. Nothing in the universe, as vast as it may seem to be, is eternal or infinite (T-29.VI.2). And therefore God could not have made it. In the Course's own words, \"The world you see is an illusion of a world. God did not create it, for what He creates must be eternal as Himself\" (C- 4.1:1-2). Within non-dualism, there can be no perception, for there is neither an observer nor an observed. So there can be no \"seeing as God sees,\" for there is nothing outside of God for God to see. Now the Course may at times use language that seems to suggest otherwise, but none of this should be taken literally, for the Course is merely attempting to reach us in a language we can understand (M-23.7:1), caught as we seem to be in a finite world of duality and limitation. For more on God and the world, see #121 and #157. And for more on the metaphoric language of the Course and God, see #42. And for further, in depth discussions of the differences between the Course and the Bible, the book A Course in Miracles and Christianity: A Dialogue, by Kenneth Wapnick, Ph.D., and W. Norris Clark, S.J., Ph.D., and the audio set The Bible from the Perspective of A Course in Miracles, by Gloria and Kenneth Wapnick, can be helpful."

    "text_input": "Q #540: Could you please explain the difference between images and visions? The reason I ask is that what I see physically is what I am physically, and what the mind sees is my projection on the world. In the other part of my mind as I pray I see also images of a different nature, like receiving an answer to a question to the Holy Spirit in symbolic form. My ego tempts me to disbelieve all images but that leaves me rather comfortless. Often these inner 'visions' have multiple interpretations, for which I have developed the habit of asking for the Holy Spirit's interpretation.",
    "output": "From the perspective of A Course in Miracles, all images or visions, whether they seem to be external in the world outside ourselves or to exist only within the mind, are the same. They are illusions projected by a split mind that believes it is outside of (separate from) God and Heaven. That is why the early workbook lessons alternate between having us focus on what we seem to see with our physical eyes and what we see with our mind's eye--our thoughts and inner images--for the inner and the outer are the same (e.g., W-pI.4; W-pI.31.2; W-pI.32.2,5; W- pI.33.1). The important difference is not in the form of the image nor in its seeming source in the world or in the mind, but in the purpose it serves, as you have been trying to determine. The same image can serve either an ego purpose or the Holy Spirit's purpose. If it leads you in the direction of fear, guilt, judgment, attack, specialness, self interest, etc., it is serving the ego's purpose of separation and sin quite effectively. And if it helps you to remember that your only aim is to release judgment and recognize shared interests, the Holy Spirit's purpose of forgiveness is the source of inspiration. These two alternatives are clearly articulated in the workbook lesson, \"All things I think I see reflect ideas\" (W-pII.325): \"This is salvation's keynote: What I see reflects a process in my mind, which starts with my idea of what I want. From there, the mind makes up an image of the thing the mind desires, judges valuable, and therefore seeks to find. These images are then projected outward, looked upon, esteemed as real and guarded as one's own. From insane wishes comes an insane world. From judgment comes a world condemned. And from forgiving thoughts a gentle world comes forth, with mercy for the holy Son of God, to offer him a kindly home where he can rest a while before he journeys on, and help his brothers walk ahead with him, and find the way to Heaven and to God\" (W-pII.325.1). And what this passage hopefully will help you see more clearly is that what we see reflects our own choice. Nothing we see comes to us uninvited. So if you find that you do not like what you are seeing, simply accept that you have made a mistake and would like the Holy Spirit's help in seeing differently (e.g., W-pI.20-22)."

    "text_input": "Q #541: I've been having trouble with Chapter 12, section III, \"The Investment in Reality.\" Jesus says that if someone asks something \"outrageous\" we should do it because it does not matter. This causes me great fear because all my life I've been unable to say no and this is something I need to do for my own mental health. I thought that we were under no laws but God's and he never demands anything. This seems like a demand to me. It makes me feel like I am under anyone's control if they feel like asking me to do something and get mad if I don't. I must be interpreting this wrong because it causes fear in me unlike the rest of A Course in Miracles. How could God expect us to bow to others wishes like this? Does this not contradict all the rest?",
    "output": "Your confusion with this passage is a common one among Course students, because of our strong ego-based inclination to confuse form with content. Rest assured that Jesus is never talking about behavior but only our underlying thoughts and attitudes. Let's look at the sentence in the larger context: \"Recognize what does not matter, and if your brothers ask you for something 'outrageous,' do it because it does not matter. Refuse, and your opposition establishes that it does matter to you. It is only you, therefore, who have made the request outrageous, and every request of a brother is for you. Why would you insist in denying him? For to do so is to deny yourself and impoverish both. He is asking for salvation, as you are. Poverty is of the ego, and never of God. No 'outrageous' requests can be made of one who recognizes what is valuable and wants to accept nothing else. Salvation is for the mind, and it is attained through peace. This is the only thing that can be saved and the only way to save it. Any response other than love arises from a confusion about the 'what' and the 'how' of salvation, and this is the only answer\" (T-12.III.4:1-8; 5:1-3). In this particular passage, our tendency is to focus on the part of the statement \"do it\" although the words Jesus is emphasizing, indicated by the italics, are concerned with our interpretation of the request and our motivation. His focus is not on \"do it\" but on \"because it does not matter.\" Jesus is asking us to look at our resistance to our brother's request. If we are in our right mind, we will hear the real request that is beneath the specific words and we will be willing to respond, for, in the words of this passage, \"he is asking for salvation.\" Our response may or may not be in the form of what he is asking for--not refusing our brother's request does not mean that we do exactly what he asks behaviorally. But our attitude will not be one of resistance or rejection but an openness to respond with what he is really asking for--the love he does not know is his. Jesus knew we would misinterpret this passage through our ego confusion of form and content and so he adds a clarification several chapters later: \"I have said that if a brother asks a foolish thing of you to do it. But be certain that this does not mean to do a foolish thing that would hurt either him or you, for what would hurt one will hurt the other. Foolish requests are foolish merely because they conflict, since they always contain some element of specialness. Only the Holy Spirit recognizes foolish needs as well as real ones. And He will teach you how to meet both without losing either\" (T-16.I.6:4-8). Once again, Jesus shifts the focus from the specific behavior to the underlying content and asks us to turn to the Holy Spirit for help, because our own interpretation will view our brother's request as an attack rather than as a call for love. That's why we need to ask for help for ourselves first before we can respond to our brother's real request. So long as we see ourselves as limited and vulnerable, we will view our brother's request as an unreasonable demand upon us and we will inevitably respond defensively, as if we can be diminished by our brother's demands. But if we are in our right mind, we will be able to hear our brother's request for what it really is--a fearful call for love from one who does not believe he deserves love. And we will know that the only response that is called for is love (T-12.I.3-5), of which we are not the source. Through our willingness to be a channel for the love he is calling for, we are saying we are willing to experience the love ourselves. That is why, as Jesus says in the earlier passage, to refuse a brother's request is to impoverish yourself as well. The anger and the resistance you feel are the cues that the ego is running the show. So while you feel that you may need to keep boundaries to protect yourself, Jesus is saying that it is still possible to respond to your brother's underlying request for love. For Jesus would never ask us to do anything that we believe would hurt ourselves--we are always the ones who demand that of ourselves."

    "text_input": "Q #542: The answer to #324 contains a line that deals with an aspect of A Course in Miracles that still eludes me: \"It is never the external situation that causes our loss of peace.\" For whatever reason I just don't get this concept. This seems to be saying that if I break a leg, it's not the broken leg that is causing me distress, or if someone in the apartment above me is playing really vulgar music extremely loud and driving me crazy with it that it's not what the people are doing that is upsetting me. How does one look at something that is annoying or hurting the heck out of them and not be distressed by it?",
    "output": "Your perplexity, which most students of the Course share as they begin to learn of this principle, is understandable. Not getting it is what keeps the ego in business and that is why we have such difficulty understanding it. But the Course is saying exactly that: a broken leg or people playing loud vulgar music upstairs is not the cause of your upset or distress. Perhaps if you can recognize how the same event can trigger different reactions in you at different times (e.g., sometimes you may not get upset by the loud music), or how different people do not have the same reactions to the same external event, you may begin to get a glimpse at the truth behind the statement you quote. It is the meaning we give to an event, and in particular the degree to which we personalize it, and not the event itself that determines how we react. The Course, speaking of anger--but the principle applies equally to any type of upset or distress--says, \"Perhaps it will be helpful to remember that no one can be angry [or distressed] at a fact. It is always an interpretation that gives rise to negative emotions, regardless of their seeming justification by what appears as facts\" (M-17.4:1-2). You may not have realized it, but this is the principle behind the early workbook lesson, \"I am never upset for the reason I think\" (W-pI.5). Although this workbook lesson does not articulate the real reason for our upset, the cause lies in our mind's decision to see ourselves as separate from love, with the guilt that inevitably accompanies that decision. That is the only reason we ever experience distress and upset, but the cause is buried deeply within our unconscious mind so that we are not aware of it. That amnesia is a major aspect of the ego's strategy, so that we then can project the buried guilt onto anyone or anything that seems to be outside ourselves and hold them responsible for how we feel. If we really knew this is what we are choosing to do, we would not do it for very long. For then it would become clear that how we feel has nothing to do with anyone else and nothing to do with what seems to be happening to our bodies. One of the clearest statements of this relationship between our guilt and how we feel is found in the following text passage: \"Once you were unaware of what the cause of everything the world appeared to thrust upon you, uninvited and unasked, must really be. Of one thing you were sure: Of all the many causes you perceived as bringing pain and suffering to you, your guilt was not among them. Nor did you in any way request them for yourself. This is how all illusions came about\" (T-27.VII.7:3-6). Jesus' challenging task is to help us undo the false associations we have built in our minds between what seems to happen outside of us and how we feel. This is the essence of forgiveness, as we release our judgments and condemnation against others and begin to accept that we are the only ones who can deprive ourselves of our peace of mind. While this means accepting responsibility for how we feel and not placing the blame elsewhere--a difficult acknowledgment while we remain identified with our egos--it also provides us with the way out of our pain and distress. For now no one and nothing else needs to change. We only have to change our minds and accept a different Teacher to interpret what we are experiencing. From the manual section we quoted from earlier, \"If anger [or distress] comes from an interpretation and not a fact, it is never justified. Once this is even dimly grasped, the way is open. Now it is possible to take the next step. The interpretation can be changed at last\" (M-17.4:1-2; 8:6-9). And that is why we need a different Teacher, Who will provide us with a different way of looking at our situation, while we remain so invested in blaming others. So it is even possible to break a leg and not only not become upset, but feel no pain, as over time our identification shifts from our body to our mind through practicing forgiveness. For we will no longer need the defense against the guilt in our mind that the body has been made to provide. This underlies Jesus' powerful teaching in \"The Message of the Crucifixion\" (T-6.I.3-5), where he emphasizes that \"assault can ultimately be made only on the body\" but that \"if you respond with anger, you must be equating yourself with the destructible [the body], and are therefore regarding yourself insanely\" (T-6.I.4:1,7). This is where the teaching, with Jesus' help, is ultimately leading us. As he reminds us, \"I am like you and you are like me, but our fundamental equality can be demonstrated only through joint decision\" (T-6.I.5:1)."

    "text_input": "Q #543: Would you kindly elaborate on the potential meanings and implications of these sentences from the text of A Course in Miracles: \"God's laws hold only for your protection, and they never hold in vain. What you experience when you deny your Father is still for your protection, for the power of your will cannot be lessened without the intervention of God against it, and any limitation on your power is not the Will of God\" (T-11.IV.2:3-4).",
    "output": "When we identify with the ego thought system we will experience ourselves as separate beings, with interests that conflict and compete with others. This is not the truth, but if we acknowledge that everything we experience here is a consequence of that choice for the ego, we can at any time change that decision and choose against the ego, thereby regaining awareness of the oneness of the Sonship. In the paragraphs preceding and following the one you cite, this is what Jesus is talking about. He thus says explicitly, \"Never forget that the Sonship is your salvation, for the Sonship is your Self\" (1:1). And in speaking of our choice to judge certain people as not worthy of sharing the gifts God gave His Son, Jesus teaches us that we are thereby diminishing our own participation in these gifts, and it is the law of God that they be shared without limit: \"Would you cut off a brother from the light that is yours? You would not do so if you realized that you can darken only your own mind. As you bring him back, so will you return. That is the law of God, for the protection of the Wholeness of His Son\" (3:4-7). God's Son is One--that is His law. So even if in our delusional state we experience ourselves as separate, God's law still holds. Nothing can prevail against it. Our obstinacy in maintaining that we are right is therefore futile, and all of our attempts to abdicate responsibility for our separated state by blaming others for our suffering and problems are futile as well. If it is God's Will that the Sonship be whole, then it is our will too. That is the principle of the Atonement, which is represented in our right minds. Thus, in the next Chapter (T-12.I), Jesus teaches that our denial of our Identity as part of God is a call for help, which means that if we are denying something, it must be there. That is our protection; the Atonement is our protection. We can never truly separate ourselves from our Source, nor from the oneness in which God created us."

    "text_input": "Q #544: A comment about #328, which asked: If everything is illusion, how can A Course in Miracles exist?  The Course does not exist. It is part of our illusion. The Holy Spirit's job is to use various aspects of our illusions to guide us gently back to reality. So the Holy Spirit has used not only paper and ink (illusion) but also our concept that \"something is wrong and needs to be corrected\" (illusion) and has turned them to a holy purpose, that of gently guiding us back to reality. The Holy Spirit is manipulating part of our dream to guide us to a happy awakening. Is this a correct understanding?",
    "output": "At a very practical level, your understanding is quite correct. The Course teaches us that the Holy Spirit can use everything the ego has made for separation as a means for healing (e.g., T- 6.V-A.2:4-5; T-7.IV.3:3), if we will offer it to Him for His purpose. And this is a very helpful way to see our Guide and Comforter--the part of our split mind that remembers both God and Who we are--while we remain trapped in the illusions of our own making. For it offers a correction to how the ego would have us view God and His Representative within the dream--as the vengeful enemy. But there is another level of understanding that, as we progress with the Course, will lead us beyond even this very helpful mythology. Not only is the Course illusion, but the Holy Spirit, as a separate Helper Who manipulates illusory ego symbols, is illusion as well. Speaking of the Holy Spirit near the end of the book, the Course explains: \"His is the Voice for God, and has therefore taken form. This form is not His reality, which God alone knows along with Christ, His real Son, Who is part of Him ... He seems to be a Voice, for in that form He speaks God's Word to you. He seems to be a Guide through a far country, for you need that form of help. He seems to be whatever meets the needs you think you have\" (C- 6.1:4-5; 4:5-7). All of these and the other many functions ascribed to the Holy Spirit are useful fictions while we believe we are separate and alone. But when time is over and we have awakened from the dream, we will no longer have need for such helpful symbols: \"And then the Voice is gone, no longer to take form but to return to the eternal formlessness of God\" (C-6.5:8)."

Is this part of the condition we are able to achieve as we move closer to the real world, perhaps one of the characteristics of what the Course calls the \"Happy Learner\" in Chapter 14? If we had a completely disease free and healthy body, then we could be drawn toward reality motivated by a genuine desire to regain our awareness of our Father rather than being \"driven\" by physical pain and fear. Would you please comment on all this?",
    "output": "Sorry, but that's not what Jesus means here. It could appear to happen that way in form in some individual cases, but you can never judge anything real by form. If you read the next few sentences after the line you cite, it is clear that Jesus is not describing what happens to the body itself: \"The body no more dies than it can feel. It does nothing. Of itself it is neither corruptible nor incorruptible. It is nothing\" (T-19.IV-C.5:2-5). He is simply saying that we will no longer see our bodies serving the purpose of corruption. The body will no longer be corrupted by the guilt of the ego thought system, for we will know that the ego's guilt is not true. And even though the body may change in form, appearing to age and even become disabled or diseased, if there is no thought of sickness or death--guilt--in the mind, these changes in form will have no connotations of death and sickness to us--\"The body can but serve your purpose. As you look on it, so will it seem to be\" (T-19.IV-C.6:3-4). What happened to Jesus' body at the end of his earthly \"life\" illustrates this principle. His body did not represent any thought of death or disease or pain in his mind, since his mind was free of guilt. He did not use his body to reinforce a belief in sin and victimization in his mind (T- 6.I.5)--and so it remained incorruptible in his perception, despite how its form may have seemed to change. He did not allow it to be corrupted in his thinking by making it a symbol of accusation against others. We can also see the Course's discussion here of the incorruptible body as a correction for the glorified, resurrected body that Christian doctrine teaches Jesus' physical resurrection has assured all of his faithful followers. As he says of his own body earlier in this section: \"Yet would I offer you my body, you whom I love, knowing its littleness? Or would I teach that bodies cannot keep us apart? Mine was of no greater value than yours ... To think you could be satisfied and happy with so little is to hurt yourself\" (T-19.IV-A.17:5-7,12). One final point of clarification: it is not physical pain or fear that drive us either toward or away from an awareness of our Father. The body, as nothing, feels nothing, as we noted above. All pain and fear are in the mind and it is here that they must be addressed and released. The body only returns to the mind the messages that the mind first wants and then sends out (T-19.IV- A.10-15)."

We didn't create Christ  and the archangels. And I do believe that there are other paths to return to God. Are those who don't believe in Christ, Mother Mary, the Saints etc. on the right track?",
    "output": "Since the separation never occurred (T-6.II.10:7) and we \"are at home in God dreaming of exile\" (T-10.I.2:1), the true answer to your question is that there is no track, because there is nowhere to go: \"The journey to God is merely the reawakening of the knowledge of where you are always, and what you are forever. It is a journey without distance to a goal that has never changed\" (T-8.VI.9:6-7). However, since we do believe that our experience in the dream is real, we think we need a path to return to God. We are set on this path when a choice for God and against the ego is made in the mind. This choice is the \"right track.\" The specific form in which this choice is experienced or expressed in the dream of separation is not important. For some people, belief in Christ, Mary and the saints is the form the choice for God takes. For others, the choice may not take religious form at all. In the manual (M-1.3) the Course refers to this choice as answering the Call of the universal course. The \"answer,\" or the \"right track,\" that sets us on the path to God is seeing someone else's interest as the same as one's own (M-1.1). Once this happens, the outcome is certain for, as we are told in the text: \"There is no path that does not lead to Him [God]\" (T- 31.IV.11:7). An important principle of the Course's teaching is the distinction between form and content. The passages cited above clearly indicate that the Course teaches that form varies significantly, and is unimportant. It is the content in the mind that establishes the goal, which, as stated earlier, is always either a choice for God or a choice for the ego. Just as the choice for God may be experienced and expressed in many forms, some of which are not religious in nature, so, too, the choice for the ego may use religious forms for its purpose of separation. This explains why there are so many individuals and groups who attack and destroy in God's name, or may use their belief in Christ to keep themselves separate from those who do not share their belief. Again, it is the choice for God in the mind that matters, not the form. As Jesus tells us in the manual: \" ... it is all a matter of time. Everyone will answer in the end\" (M-1.2:8-9)."

Can we, Sons of God, do miracles in this world as well? What does the A Course in Miracles mean when it says we should offer miracles to others?",
    "output": "Scripture scholars differ in their understanding of the historical accuracy of the gospel accounts of what Jesus did during his lifetime. However, regardless of the accuracy of the gospels, the Course teaches a different meaning of miracles. What the Course means by a miracle is a change of mind. It is a course in miracles because it is a course in learning to change our minds from thinking with the ego to thinking with the Holy Spirit. It is a process of undoing the ego by learning a new perspective that reverses the ego's view on everything and everyone. The ego tells us we are bodies, separate from God and from each other, subject to change by external forces. The Holy Spirit tells us we are minds, one with our Father and with each other, subject to change only by the power of the mind to choose. We accept miracles for ourselves to the extent that we accept this teaching, and apply it to all events, situations, and experiences in our lives. We offer miracles to others as we recognize the same power of their minds to choose. As Jesus tells us in the text: \"The miracle extends without your help, but you are needed that it can begin. Accept the miracle of healing, and it will go forth because of what it is. It is its nature to extend itself the instant it is born. And it is born the instant it is offered and received. No one can ask another to be healed. But he can let himself be healed, and thus offer the other what he has received\" (T-27.V.1:2-7). A further extension of this principle is the process of forgiveness, whereby we recognize that nothing external to our minds can cause us to feel anything positive or negative, and therefore, no one is responsible for how we feel. That is what is meant by Jesus' invitation: \"Be willing to forgive the Son of God for what he did not do.\" Thus forgiveness is the miracle we offer to our brothers. In recognizing that our experience is the result of a decision in our minds to identify with the ego or with the Holy Spirit, all our brothers are released from blame, and their innocence is brought to our awareness. This is the miracle of the healing of the mind, given and received."

With repeated recognition of shared interests, we will begin to understand that it is not the world but our own mind that is the source of all our unhappiness, and so it is the source of all happiness as well. This understanding produces a state of miracle readiness that will become easier and easier to access over time, as we become increasingly willing to shift our attention from the world outside to the decision in our mind to choose between the ego and the Holy Spirit. This is a process in time for, in A Course in Miracles' own words, \"The miracle does not awaken you, but merely shows you who the dreamer is. It teaches you there is a choice of dreams while you are still asleep, depending on the purpose of your dreaming. Do you wish for dreams of healing, or for dreams of death?\" (T-28.II.4:2-4). There is a level at which it is true that, once we have chosen the miracle, there is no other choice to be made. But this will not be our experience, as we seem to vacillate between right-minded and wrong-minded thinking, while completely releasing our identification with the illusory ego remains too fearful. Once experienced, we can not negate the miracle. But we can forget it as we allow our focus to shift back to the seeming concerns of the world and our illusory self, engaging in judgment and attack as we now perceive our interests as separate from everyone else's. In the context of the holy instant--another term for the miracle--Jesus explains: \"The experience of an instant [miracle], however compelling it may be, is easily forgotten if you allow time to close over it ... The instant remains. But where are you? ... To attack your brother is not to lose the instant, but to make it powerless in its effects. You have received the holy instant, but you may have established a condition in which you cannot use it. As a result, you do not realize that it is with you still. And by cutting yourself off from its expression, you have denied yourself its benefit. You reinforce this every time you attack your brother, for the attack must blind you to yourself. And it is impossible to deny yourself, and to recognize what has been given and received by you\" (T-17.V.12:1,3,4,6; 13:1-5)."

    "text_input": "Q #551: I know two people who are attracted to A Course in Miracles but have too much difficulty specifically with statements such as anger is never justified. I explain that this does not mean that one should not get angry, or would become guilty by being angry--apparently Jesus knows we are angry and will get angry. And I explain that this is so on a metaphysical level, since anger can only be projection, etc. But still they both think this statement about anger makes the student feel guilty and unfree. Could you comment on this?",
    "output": "There is much in the Course for egos to object to, regardless of whether or not it is one's path back home to God. From the Course's perspective, these disagreements are simply the ego's self- protective defenses against the truth. As students of the Course, we all have our different excuses for not accepting or doing what Jesus asks us to do--forgiving, which means looking at our ego and all its judgments and then letting them go. Yet he never judges us for our resistance. What you may first want to get in touch with for yourself is any investment you have in others' getting and accepting the Course's message. This is a wonderful distraction to keep the focus away from our own forgiveness process. Yet honestly looking at any investments we have becomes yet another opportunity to practice forgiveness. Our egos would much prefer that we focus on convincing others about the Course than about putting its principles into practice in our own minds. We need not be concerned with persuading anyone else of the truth or rightness of the Course. Our only responsibility, if the Course is our path, is to accept the Atonement for ourselves, as the Course repeatedly reminds us (e.g., T-5.V.7:8; M-7.3:2-6; M-22.1:10). In terms of the specific issue of anger you raise, Jesus is simply making a statement of fact-- anger could only be justified if sin and guilt were real. Since sin and guilt are illusions of the ego thought system whose only purpose is to convince us of the ego's existence, anything that follows from them can not be real either. But since we take ourselves and our egos very seriously, we certainly will continue to experience anger--to deny that we do would not be at all helpful. From Jesus' perspective--outside the ego thought system--there simply is no real reason or justification for experiencing anger. Our egos may defensively insist there must be a judgment behind such a statement, but that is not at all Jesus' intention. If we can recognize that in the Course's use of terms, anger is equated with attack--as thoughts, they are both the same (e.g., T-7.VIII.5:4; T-30.VI.1:1-2; W-pI.21.3)--the statement that attack is never justified may be easier to accept and recognize as true. In summary, Jesus doesn't say not to get angry, just not to justify it when we do."

I have also experienced some wonderful insights and growth and love to share my learning with others when the opportunity presents itself. But sometimes people are so happy or impressed with what I said or so helped by it that they will say \"Where do you get this stuff?\" I have not told many people about the Course or what I am doing but I feel funny saying \"Well the Holy Spirit told me.\" Some of my buddies (I am 26) would look at me like \"What in the world are you talking about?\" What would you advise?",
    "output": "Are you comfortable in simply stating that the ideas have come to you as a result of studying and practicing A Course in Miracles? And if your friends ask what that is, could you not just say it is a spiritual path that focuses on forgiveness and peace? Then leave it up to them to pursue it or not. If you are joined with the Holy Spirit when you are talking with your friends, you would be peaceful and have no investment in saying anything, and if you do say something, you would have no investment in how your friends react to it, because the love and peace of the Holy Spirit would be being expressed through you, and you would know the \"message\" is not coming from you. All sense of specialness and self-importance diminish to nothing in the holy instant. Yet, you would appear as perfectly normal to others, in the sense that you would not stand out, aside from being more peaceful and happy."

I also think I'm consistent in wanting it be a classroom for the Holy Spirit's purpose, and in trying to observe with Jesus my thoughts and my interaction with her. Yet I believe this is definitely a special relationship in that I do the things with her that lovers do for my own emotional and physical gratification, but being careful that she, too, is getting the same. And I pray that the Holy Spirit uses the relationship for His purposes. So I'm wondering if I should necessarily expect the relationship to \"seem disturbed, disjunctive and even quite disturbing\" (T-17.V.3:3), as it would be if there were no intent to use it to learn the Holy Spirit's lesson.",
    "output": "Sounds like you're trying to be as honest as you can about your new relationship, and that is very helpful. The line you quote from A Course in Miracles is referring to an ongoing special relationship in which the purpose has been changed from the ego's purpose of guilt to the Holy Spirit's purpose of forgiveness. It would appear that you have entered into this special relationship with your eyes open, as well as your mind to a different purpose from the beginning--shared and not separate interests. So long as you are willing to look honestly at how a part of you still wants to use the relationship to meet your own specialness needs, making special love bargains to try to assure that they continue to be met, and you can do that without guilt or fear while recognizing the cost to you, the distressing aspects Jesus refers to need not be inevitable. But it is helpful to remember that special relationships are made from the projections of our own buried guilt and we most likely will not be aware of all the guilt that has been projected except over time, as the relationship seems to develop and different expectations about how we want our needs to be met arise. When we are in the so-called \"honeymoon period,\" there is much that we overlook in the other without being aware of it. That is not to say that you should expect things to become difficult but only that it will be helpful to be vigilant for your own ego and how it will attempt to trip you up, finding ways--sometimes subtle, sometimes not so subtle--to place blame outside yourself for how you are feeling (T-17.V.8:2). That is an inevitable dynamic of the ego and the best way to deal with it is to be aware of it. For those are the forgiveness lessons that the special relationship offers, when we are willing to have the Holy Spirit as our Teacher."

    "text_input": "Q #554: On an audio recording from an academy class given last summer, I heard Ken say: \"When you are upset, you pray to yourself that you will ask help of the right teacher (the Holy Spirit).\" I assume that \"yourself\" refers to the decision maker, but to whom does each \"you\" refer?",
    "output": "\"Only minds communicate\" (T-7.V.2:1), so each \"you\" refers to the mind. Just as in A Course in Miracles Jesus is always speaking to the mind, in the Academy Ken, too, speaks to the mind, because no other communication is possible. However, since we believe we are in bodies, the body is used as a means for the communication that is occurring in the mind. The experience of being upset is the reflection of a choice in the mind to listen to the ego. The correction, then, is for the mind to remember that it has the power to choose, and then to choose to listen to the Holy Spirit. That is what is meant by \"pray to yourself that you will ask help of the right teacher.\" Because we identify with the body, we make the mistake of thinking it is the body (brain) that has the ability to choose, to ask, or to decide. What actually occurs is the mind chooses to identify with the ego, splits off from its true Identity, and then confuses itself with the body. The body is the effect of choosing the ego; it only \"thinks\" it is the cause of what seems to happen in the dream. We then experience each \"you\" as different. This confusion of cause and effect, mind and body, is the upside-down perception Jesus speaks about in the workbook: \"Your upside- down perception has been ruinous to your peace of mind. You have seen yourself in a body and the truth outside you, locked away from your awareness by the body's limitations\" (W-pI.72.8:3- 4). Herein lies the real source of any upset. In the Course Jesus is teaching us to turn to him, or the Holy Spirit, to correct our perception. Seeing everything in the dream as the result of having chosen the ego or the Holy Spirit as teacher, is the first step in healing the mind of misperception, and is itself the result of having agreed to accept the Holy Spirit's teaching. The mind then has the opportunity to do as Jesus invites: \"In every difficulty, all distress, and each perplexity Christ calls to you and gently says, 'My brother, choose again'\" (T-31.VIII.3:2)."

For example, \"I want to have a good day at my sisters house; help me be kind to the patients at work,\" etc. If you answered from the highest level, the feelings you could ask for would be love, peace and joy, but what experiences would you ask for at this highest level? Or would I not ask for anything because I already have it? I'm trying to apply this to my life and I usually ask for specific things because I feel more connected with Jesus and I can walk through the day with him. What level should I be asking from, could you please clarify?",
    "output": "It's easy to read this line by itself and interpret it as you are doing. And there is nothing wrong with asking for specifics if that is where you feel you are on the ladder back home. Most of us, if we are honest with ourselves, would have to admit that we are at the level of believing and experiencing that we have specific needs most of the time. But in the context of the whole section, which emphasizes the need for not making decisions on our own, Jesus is inviting us here to have a day free of judgment. And that means we would not give our interpretation to any of the events or experiences of the day, thinking that we are in a position to judge what we want and need. And knowing that we will of course more than likely fall into the trap of judging what seems to happen, Jesus provides us with the steps to remember what we really want (peace of mind) and to change our minds again about Who we will let interpret our day. Whenever I identify a specific need in terms of how I want events to occur that I believe will make me happy, I am usurping the role of the Holy Spirit and setting myself up for disappointment and failure, which of course is exactly what my ego wants me to do. For then I can blame my unhappiness and loss of peace on external people and events rather than on a decision I made in my mind to be and to choose on my own--in other words, a decision for separation. That is why, although specifics may be the form in which I am at present comfortable in limiting and accepting infinite love, they are always a double-edged \"gift\" that keeps me identified with the illusion and reinforcing its reality in my own mind. Again, this is not to say we should not ask for specifics, but Jesus wants us to be aware that he is offering us so much more than the limited gifts we are willing to accept right now. If we don't at least recognize that, we will not be able to grow into the higher levels of asking that lead us up the ladder back home."

    "text_input": "Q #556: What is the meaning of gratitude according to A Course in Miracles? Lesson 195 says to be grateful to God/Jesus because we are not separate, and that is the only thing to be grateful for. I was wondering about gratitude lists that people do (e.g., I'm grateful for my husband who understands me; I'm grateful for the nice person I met in the store today, I'm grateful for the nice walk I took today) Is there any place for lists like these?",
    "output": "Your question reflects the two ways of experiencing gratitude: the ego's and the Holy Spirit's. The gratitude the Holy Spirit leads us to is clearly described in Lesson 195, as you point out. We learn through the Course that we are not bodies; we are minds, one with our Father and with each other. For this we are truly grateful. The ego, with whom we identify as bodies, is \"grateful\" when its specialness needs are met, and when it gets what it wants. When we make the mistake of believing that we are separate bodies, cut off from our true Identity as mind, a deep, pervasive sense of emptiness and need is inevitable. We are then compelled to seek to fill the perceived emptiness with relationships, things, and experiences. When we find them we are \"grateful,\" because they seem to meet our need. The things you mention, along with anything that we are \"grateful\" for, meet a perceived need or fulfill some expectation of how we judge things should be. These perceived needs and expectations all have their source in the choice to listen to the ego and believe in the body. The mistake is to believe that someone or something external to the mind will heal the feeling of loss and emptiness caused by belief in the body. The pursuit of these external solutions is endless because they do not meet our real need, which is to accept the truth toward which the Holy Spirit is leading us. That is not to say that we should not enjoy the things we value in the dream, nor seek the things we think we need. They are the special relationships that the Course tells us can be transformed by the Holy Spirit through forgiveness, which removes from the special relationships the power to take away our peace or make us happy. We are then grateful to ourselves for not perceiving anyone or anything outside our own minds as having this power, and for this same reason we are grateful to them. We thus experience the true gratitude the Course speaks of; no matter what happens nor what others do or do not do: \"When your forgiveness is complete you will have total gratitude, for you will see that everything has earned the right to love by being loving, even as your Self\" (W-pI.195.8:6)."

    "text_input": "Q #557: I sense that it's all an illusion; however, within the playing of the illusion it sometimes seems that the thoughts and ego-type stuff isn't really mine and are on some occasions coming from other entities or others spaces. When I recognize that, they sometimes go away. Didn't Jesus go to the desert to release some of those type of influences? What if anything does A Course in Miracles say about this matter?",
    "output": "First, the Bible talks about Jesus going to the desert to get rid of negative forces, but as with any other account of his life, most biblical scholars are of the opinion that there is very, very little in these accounts that can be regarded as factual. Second, a major emphasis in A Course in Miracles is on helping us recover the power of our own minds, so that we can be healed of the erroneous belief that we are at the mercy of forces outside us over which we have no control, which would include the belief that there are entities talking to us. Carrying out the ego's strategy, we wound up essentially mindless, thinking we are victims of what is done to us. And so the help Jesus gives us through his message and the exercises in the workbook lessons is to train us to gradually accept more and more responsibility for our thoughts and perceptions until we finally have no thoughts or desires that are not perfectly in accord with his, which are perfectly in accord with God's. Jesus never mentions the word demons, and he uses the word devil in Chapter 3 of the text, where he says that the very concept makes no sense: \"The 'devil' is a frightening concept because he seems to be extremely powerful and extremely active. He is perceived as a force in combat with God, battling Him for possession of His creations. The devil deceives by lies, and builds kingdoms in which everything is in direct opposition to God. Yet he attracts men rather than repels them, and they are willing to 'sell' him their souls in return for gifts of no real worth. This makes absolutely no sense\" (T-3.VII.2). Jesus continues with his correction of traditional biblical teachings and then provides us with a new definition: \"The mind can make the belief in separation very real and very fearful, and this belief is the 'devil''' (5:1). Stated briefly, the ego and anything of the ego is rooted in our own thoughts and beliefs, for which we are completely responsible. That is what our work as students of the Course centers on: learning to recognize how we are defending against this truth and how we are protecting ourselves from ever getting back into our minds. Jesus is training us to identify these defenses so that we can then identify the fear within our minds that led us to believe we needed defenses. When we are back in our minds and realize that the ego is nothing but an erroneous belief we accepted, we will simply smile at the silliness of our ever having taken it seriously and believing that there are forces and entities that could adversely affect us. So the heart of Jesus' teaching is that we would learn how to look with him at our ego--nothing more than that--just look, and if we are doing it with him, there would be no fear. The Course's approach therefore is very simple: there is only the ego or the Holy Spirit, and the ego rests on nothingness. Finally, since the ego is ultimately only a belief, it will go away when we no longer value that belief. There is no need to fight against it or try to banish it. Simply look at it with Jesus and smile gently; it has no existence other than our belief in it."

    "text_input": "Q #558: I am looking at quieting my mind and observing all my suffering from a new point of view. A Course in Miracles says my only function is forgiving. It speaks to me of choosing that which is of value. It says I must look first at what I made in order to see what is and isn't of value. My question is how do I look straight into all my ego-generated drama and hold on to that  which is of value. I know that if my only function is forgiving, then that which is of value comes from that premise. But I get very caught up in the drama and find it hard to discern the valuable from the valueless. I am also looking at letting go of judgment, which I am beginning to see as valueless. I could use help in finding coping skills and daily meditations to help me through this change.",
    "output": "Yes, the Course is inviting us to take a look at our lives and all our suffering and pain from a completely different perspective. All of our categories and criteria up until now for sorting out what is valuable and helpful in our lives suddenly lose their validity, as the basic premise for deciding shifts from meeting our needs to letting go of our judgments, which is what the Course means by forgiveness. Two broad, all-encompassing generalizations follow from this new premise for deciding--nothing of the ego is of any value in itself, but everything of the ego provides us with the opportunities we need to practice forgiveness. This also means that our focus shifts from the seemingly endless process of evaluating the ceaseless flow of external events in terms of their potential impact on our physical, emotional, mental, and psychological well-being, to a continuous monitoring of our own inner thoughts to ascertain whether or not they are helpful for recognizing our genuine well-being (sinlessness), which has already been guaranteed by God (W-pI.93.6-7). So in practical terms, what does this mean? First of all, it means that you need not change anything external in terms of your routines and practices and daily activities, other than perhaps beginning the workbook lessons, if you have not already. For the workbook exercises provide the very specific instructions and meditations you are asking for to help bring about the shift from the outer to the inner focus--that is their purpose (W-in). But all the other things in your life-- your relationships, your job, your struggles, all the ego drama--now become the classrooms in which you learn to practice forgiveness. This is their value, for these are the situations you have set up in your life onto which you have deliberately but erroneously projected responsibility for determining how you feel about yourself and whether or not you are happy. Whenever you find yourself making judgments about anything in your life, it is because you have made it a screen for your own guilt over the thought of separation, so that it can now be seen outside you. The first step in the forgiveness process then is to withdraw that projection from outside and acknowledge the guilt's source in your own mind. And then, with the help of Jesus or the Holy Spirit, you can release the guilt into the light of true forgiveness, which sees none of it as true. Having described all this, it may be helpful to acknowledge that the resistance to this simple process is tremendous. So don't be surprised if much of the time your thinking seems oblivious to this correction, mindlessly proceeding along its well-worn path of projecting responsibility for how you feel onto everyone but yourself. Gradually over time, with gentleness and patience, the awareness of how you want to sabotage the process and yourself will become more apparent. And the choice you have in each situation between the ego and the Holy Spirit will become increasingly obvious, as your willingness grows through the practice of forgiveness and the experience of its joyful effects."

This is the miracle by which creation became your function, sharing it with God.",
    "output": "There are two important points to consider when tracing a term throughout the three books of A Course in Miracles and the two companion pamphlets: Jesus is not always consistent in his use of terms and he often indulges the liberties we all graciously accept in the works of great poets and teachers; but if you stay focused on the content of his teaching, the conflicts arising from the form of his teaching will be eliminated, or at least greatly minimized. The statements you list are examples of the inconsistency on the level of form. Strictly speaking, a miracle is a correction, and therefore pertains only to the illusion. But in some of the passages you list, a miracle is linked to God and creation, which of course could never be the case, as God knows nothing of error in need of correction, and creation is a function only within the Oneness of Heaven. Moreover, the inconsistency occasionally appears to be more of a contradiction if you stay only on the form level. Jesus emphatically states early in the text, for example, that \"to speak of 'a miracle of healing' is to combine two orders of reality inappropriately. Healing is not a miracle\" (T-2.IV.1:3-4). Yet in five other places in the Course he speaks of a \"miracle of healing\" (T-19.I.14:5; T-27.II.5:2; T-27.V.1:3; T-28.IV.10:9; M-22.4:4). Thus, if a reader/student is not tuned into his meaning (content), Jesus' loose use of words (form) could be a major problem, especially if conceptual precision is expected. But if the content of his teaching is your primary focus, then the inconsistencies would not have any effect on your spiritual progress. Kenneth has discussed this issue at length in \"Inconsistent Form and Consistent Content\" (Chapter 2) in Few Choose to Listen, Vol. II of The Message of \"A Course in Miracles,\" and in his audio album \"Duality as Metaphor.\" To return briefly to your examples ... T-3.V.6:7: \"You have lost the knowledge that you yourself are a miracle of God\" illustrates the poetic license Jesus takes at times. He is completing the thought begun in the preceding statement, \"In electing perception instead of knowledge, you placed yourself in a position where you could resemble your Father only by perceiving miraculously\" (6:6). If you can hear Jesus appealing to you and feel his love drawing you to return to your natural state in the Heart of Love, it would not matter that he is using the term miracle inconsistently. In sentence 6 he is using it properly, so to speak, to mean a correction of our misperception; while in the following sentence, he takes the same term and gives it a different twist simply to make his point, as would a lyrical poet or dramatist. So while his terminology may be inconsistent, there is no mistaking what he is trying to get across to us. And this would also be true of the other examples you give. If you focus on what he wants you to hear and to learn, the seeming mistakes in form will lessen in significance."

    "text_input": "Q #560: I came to learn about A Course in Miracles through my church. About the same time that I was learning the Course's principles I was also making a commitment to be a chaplain for my church. In my capacity as a chaplain I am to pray with congregants about issues that they request prayer about. Many of the requests I receive are ego-based problems. Knowing that the ego is an illusion makes it difficult for me to pray with others from an honest place. Is this a typical experience for people that learn ACIM? It is my desire to help others. Through ACIM I know that the only true help that I can lend is to see things rightly. How can I still help, and possibly pray with others, and yet remain true to the Course's principles?",
    "output": "If the content in your mind is love, then you will not be in conflict, even though the theologies (the form) of these two systems differ. In other words, if you feel guided to be a chaplain, and you feel that you can be truly helpful to others and yourself in this role, then you should follow that guidance. It takes a lot of practice to be able to minimize differences in form and concentrate primarily on the content in your mind, but if you can do that, you will realize that the greatest value in praying with others is the joining with them through sharing a common interest. The words do not matter, as the first section of The Song of Prayer supplement helps us understand. The fact that the form of the prayer pertains to ego-based problems would not lead to conflict if you are clear within yourself about the purpose of your praying with your congregants--that it is a means of expressing the love in your right mind. Early in the text Jesus explains: \"The value of the Atonement does not lie in the manner in which it is expressed. In fact, if it is used truly, it will inevitably be expressed in whatever way is most helpful to the receiver. This means that a miracle, to attain its full efficacy, must be expressed in a language that the recipient can understand without fear. This does not necessarily mean that this is the highest level of communication of which he is capable. It does mean, however, that it is the highest level of communication of which he is capable now. The whole aim of the miracle is to raise the level of communication, not to lower it by increasing fear\" (T-2.IV.5). In his discussion of the characteristics of God's teachers, Jesus defines honesty as \"consistency\" (M-4.II), another example of the primacy of content over form. Again, if you desire only to be loving, then the forms in which that love is expressed may conflict or be inconsistent with one another. But that would not matter. The ego would have us judge everything by form so that we would constantly reinforce our differences. Jesus is training us to get beyond our perception of form so that we would recognize that we all share the same interests, and ultimately that we are all same: the one Son of God. Thus, the role of chaplain in your church would be a means of learning this, if you feel guided to take on that role."

    "output": "A little background on the nature and \"reality\" of the ego before answering your question: The ego is nothing more than a mistaken belief about ourselves in the separated state that we seem to have given inordinate power to dictate our options and experiences (T-7.VIII.4:6-7). It is a choice to see ourselves as limited, alone, sinful, guilty and in pain. And it is a thought that is totally focused on self preservation (T-7.VI.3:1) at any price, including death. To protect it, we must deny that it is merely our choice and that we could just as easily make a different choice. This is such a tremendous threat to its continued existence that we must deny the power of our mind to have chosen it (T-7.VI.3). So when we are identified with the ego thought, we wish to deny or kill off the decision-making part of our split mind. A Course in Miracles speaks of the ego as a separate entity acting on its own as part of the myth to explain how we find ourselves trapped in illusion, but it also serves the purpose of helping us not minimize how pervasive the ego is in our thinking (T-4.VI.1:2-4). And it also enables us to begin to take steps to disidentify from it and reclaim the power of our mind to have chosen it. For we are not our egos. So, in the context of the ego myth, the \"you\" that the ego wants dead is the decision-making self, still a part of the split mind, and not the Christ. The ego self can not be aware of either God or Christ, for Limitlessness is beyond its finite grasp (T-4.VI.4). And yes, since physical \"death\" is merely a symbol in the dream of separation and has no effect on either the thought of separation or our choice for it as a decision-maker, both aspects of the split self seem to continue on after death (T-15.I.4:13-14). And so the same dynamic of guilt and attack must continue to play itself out in the split mind, until we make the choice to awaken from the dream of death. For at least unconsciously, we are aware that physical death is an illusion and ends nothing (T-15.I.4:5), and so denial of the decision-making part of our mind--seeking its death--must be pursued down every corridor and through every dimension of the split mind. That its death is never accomplished is irrelevant to the ego goal, for so long as running from death remains such an obsession and preoccupation, we will not stop to question whether it is real. And the ego thought's continued existence is assured, at least for the time being."

    "text_input": "Q #562: In Chapter 17 of A Course in Miracles, Section IV \"The Two Pictures,\" the text explains how defenses work. It says: \"It is essential to realize that all defenses do what they would defend. The underlying basis for their effectiveness is that they offer what they defend. What they defend is placed in them for safe-keeping, and as they operate they bring it to you. Every defense operates by giving gifts, and the gift is always a miniature of the thought system the defense protects, set in a golden frame. The frame is very elaborate, all set with jewels, and deeply carved and polished. Its purpose is to be of value in itself, and to divert your attention from what it encloses. But the frame without the picture you cannot have. Defenses operate to make you think you can\" (T-17.IV.7). Would you kindly elaborate on this? If my defense is, for example, eating out of fear, how does this relate?",
    "output": "We choose defenses in an attempt to handle our fear and make ourselves feel better and safer. And yet, the defense is only there because of the underlying fear that we are attempting to manage. So the defense, no matter what form it takes, becomes a constant reminder--conscious or unconscious--of the underlying fear. This is inherent in the dualistic thought system of the ego, which always operates on the assumption of polar opposites, such as safe and unsafe. We never question the underlying premise that we can be threatened, but instead accept danger as true and then seek to protect ourselves from it (W-pI.135.1-3). In the specific case of eating out of fear, food becomes equated in our mind with comforting ourselves, or filling the gaping hole that makes us feel empty and vulnerable. But giving food this purpose only reinforces our belief in discomfort and emptiness and vulnerability. Food offers us something flavorful and satisfying (the frame), which seems to make us feel better, perhaps distracting us from the gnawing feeling inside, at least temporarily. But the purpose we have given it to rescue us establishes it as a symbol of the very thing we are trying to avoid or escape--the underlying guilt and fear. And so, as a symbol of what is underneath, it becomes a reminder of what we have intended it to save us from, offering us the very same \"gifts,\" only obscured. However, once we recognize the purpose we have given food to comfort us in our fear, as with all the special gifts of the ego, we can now invite the great Comforter to join us and give food a different purpose. The correction the Holy Spirit offers would not be to stop eating but rather to use food instead as a means to remind us of the fear underneath that we have attempted to keep hidden and at bay by eating. We can bring the fear into our awareness with the Holy Spirit and question the source of that fear. For the fear is nothing more than a projection of our own guilt, represented by a gaping hole within our very being, accompanied by a devastating feeling of emptiness, because we believe we have destroyed the only thing that can truly make us feel complete and full and safe--love. With the Symbol of Love beside us, we can begin to question the premise of our emptiness, rather than continuing to try to fill it--thereby making it real-- with all of our \"substitutes for love\" (W-pI.117.1:3), such as food."

    "text_input": "Q #563: We have received several questions recently about the movie, \"The Passion of the Christ,\" and the subject of the crucifixion and A Course in Miracles. We will address all of the questions in a single answer.  : The movie, \"The Passion of the Christ,\" has gotten a lot of attention. Could you discuss the Course's view of the crucifixion and how it differs from the view held by traditional Christians?  : Mel Gibson's picture, \"The Passion of the Christ,\" has created quite a stir. How does the Course speak to the movie's theme that Jesus came to prove God's love. Did he have to die for that proof or is that just a convenient sleight of hand the Christian church has developed to perpetuate a belief in guilt and separation?  : Based on the teachings of the Course, how would you assess the Mel Gibson movie, \"The Passion of the Christ\"?  : A question about the crucifixion that I have had on my mind for a long time: Why did Jesus choose the crucifixion as a teaching device? In T-6.I.9:1, we read: \"I elected, for your sake and mine, to demonstrate that the most outrageous assault, as judged by the ego, does not matter\"-- meaning Jesus staged his own crucifixion.  Then I read in the Excerpt Series \"Jesus: Manifestation of the Holy Spirit\" Part VIII on your web site:  \"For Jesus, his crucifixion served a purpose of love. For most of us, being crucified would not serve a purpose of love. But we cannot judge by the form. The form of what happened to Jesus at the end of his life was not loving or safe--it was murderous. But because there was a thought of love in his mind--and only a thought of love--his crucifixion was an act of love from his point of view, although not from the point of view of someone who did not share his thought system.\"  As hardly anyone who attended the crucifixion--or later heard about it--was/is without an ego, it seems they could see the incident but as a catastrophe. For who wants to live a loving life to be caught and killed like Jesus? How could Jesus expect people not to judge the crucifixion by the  form when in everyday life we judge but by form? Therefore it almost seems to me, the crucifixion could cause nothing but fear and bewilderment and also about the fact that a holy man would let so many people see his crucifixion and so few his reappearance after his \"death\" and his ensuing ascension. I know I am wrong somehow but have a feeling that my reasoning is quite logical. Please help me sort this out. Thanks.",
    "output": "Setting aside for a moment the issue of whether the crucifixion is indeed an historical fact, we can see very clearly one of the basic differences between the Course and traditional Christianity by contrasting their views of the meaning and significance of the crucifixion. Christianity--and much of the world--asserts that selfless love is demonstrated through sacrifice, and that there is no greater love than to lay down one's life for one's friends (John 15:13). And since, according to Christian theology, Jesus, totally sinless and innocent and undeserving of any condemnation, laid down his life for all his brothers and sisters--so long as they are willing to accept his sacrifice on their behalf--the crucifixion becomes the greatest demonstration of love that the world has ever seen. Supporting this line of thinking, the recent movie emphasizes how great Jesus' suffering and pain and humiliation on our account must have been, as further demonstration of how much he and his Father must love us. His Father's Love is demonstrated in His willingness to offer up His only Son that our sins might be forgiven. Generally, there is little questioning of the premise behind this belief, that God the Father is the One Who set the conditions that demand such a sacrifice of His only Son--that our sins could be so heinous that God could only be appeased by the Perfect Sacrifice of His Perfect Son. The Course, on the other hand, asserts, \"Sacrifice is so essential to your thought system that salvation apart from sacrifice means nothing to you. Your confusion of sacrifice and love is so profound that you cannot conceive of love without sacrifice. And it is this that you must look upon; sacrifice is attack, not love\" (T-15.X.5:7-9). The contrast is almost startling. Earlier, in the section \"Atonement without Sacrifice,\" Jesus explains, \"Sacrifice is a notion totally unknown to God. It arises solely from fear, and frightened people can be vicious. Sacrificing in any way is a violation of my injunction that you should be merciful even as your Father in Heaven is merciful\" (T-3.I.4:1-3). So what of the selfless love that is willing to sacrifice the self? This is one of the ego's cleverest ploys, for its \"selfless love\" glorifies the self that has been sacrificed and destroyed through death. The Course, in contrast, teaches that genuine selfless love comes, not from the denial of the self--which very conveniently makes the false self real--but from the denial of the belief in the self, which is a statement of the Course's Atonement principle, that the separation never happened. And this kind of selflessness the ego cannot tolerate. The issue of the historical nature of the crucifixion ends up being a red herring from the Course's perspective. What is important to recognize is that the story has been an important part of the ego myth that perpetuates our belief in sin, guilt and fear. Jesus in the Course simply provides an alternative way of looking at the grim story that we have for so many, many eons accepted as true--that our guilt is real and God demands sacrifice. He offers us a \"wholly benign\" \"positive interpretation of the crucifixion that is wholly devoid of fear\" (T-6.I.1:5). His death has nothing to do with atoning for sins, it is merely an \"extreme example\" (T-6.I.2:1) of the basic Course teaching that persecution is not real and no one can be a victim--turning the traditional Christian interpretation completely upside down! We can only believe in persecution and assault if we equate ourselves with the body--which Jesus makes clear he did not (T-6.I.4). So, even if within the dream there had been a physical crucifixion, it would have been a part of our dream, not Jesus' dream, since he knew he was not the figure in the dream that everyone else saw him as. The scripting of the events that seemed to play out in the world would come from the collective ego, but the alternative interpretation of the meaning of those events would come from the mind joined with the Holy Spirit, which Jesus represents. The events themselves are only ever neutral symbols, which can represent either the projections of guilt of the ego or the extensions of love of the Holy Spirit. And that is the only choice Jesus is trying to teach us about the crucifixion. Which interpretation we choose will determine whether we continue to see ourselves as crucified symbols of our brothers' guilt, or gentle reminders of their innocence as well as our own (T-27.I). For additional helpful discussion on the nature and reality of Jesus, see #473, and on the crucifixion specifically, see #219 and #220."

    "text_input": "Q #564: #341 refers to our right to separate--\"conditional upon the 'right' to separate will you and he (your brother) agree to meet from time to time, and keep apart in intervals of separation.\" My question is, surely there must be a divine purpose for this illusion of separation, which is, after all, ubiquitous? Surely it must be a meaningful error. Is its purpose so that we may become conscious of and appreciate the oneness, which is the opposite of separation? Does it go: oneness ... then illusion of separation ... then awareness of oneness? Is the purpose of illusion so that God may know Himself?",
    "output": "No, sorry, your line of reasoning may be found in the explanations for the separation and the world offered by other spiritual teachings, but not A Course in Miracles. It is uncompromising in its position that God and Christ, in complete and absolute Oneness, are perfect (e.g., T-11.IV.7:5; P-3.I.1:10), to which nothing different or new need be nor can be added (T-10.in.2:1-4). So it is impossible for God or His Son to gain anything from an experience of separation--it is a contradiction of His Reality and therefore can be of no value. The thought of separation and its seeming effects are nothing but a co(s)mic mistake of infinitesimally small, nondimensional proportions, despite our experience to the contrary. The Course explains early in the text that consciousness is the domain of the ego (T-3.IV.2), since it establishes a false duality of observer and observed, as if there were two differentiated and differentiable entities. Once we speak of an experience of anything other than the one Self, we are functioning in the realm of illusion and error. There is nothing to be gained from within this state, except its undoing. Now the correction of the error will, of course, come in dualistic terms, within the realm of consciousness as it shifts from false to true perception (C-1.7). But it will be a reflection of the perfect oneness of God and Christ. Forgiveness, \"a kind of happy fiction\" (C-3.2:1), is the process that undoes the perceptual mistakes of the ego thought system, grounded as it is in separation and differences, leading to judgment and attack. Through our practice of forgiveness, we will come to know again that \"there is nothing outside you. That is what you must ultimately learn, for it is the realization that the Kingdom of Heaven is restored to you. For God created only this, and He did not depart from it nor leave it separate from Himself. The Kingdom of Heaven is the dwelling place of the Son of God, who left not his Father and dwells not apart from Him. Heaven is not a place nor a condition. It is merely an awareness of perfect Oneness, and the knowledge that there is nothing else; nothing outside this Oneness, and nothing else within\" (T-18.VI.1). You may also find the discussion presented in #109 of relevance to your question."

    "text_input": "Q #565: As a student of A Course in Miracles, my goal is to accept the Atonement for myself and live above the battleground in the real world until my body fails and then exist in oneness with God. Will I be aware of, or be able to influence those loved ones left behind who still consider themselves separated individuals living lives, or is this beyond what we can know now. Also, when people die who have never heard of the Course and/or are completely invested in their bodies, lives, individuality and separation, can they still choose to reject oneness after \"death\" and long to return to bodies and \"life\"? Is this an explanation of reincarnation? OR-- Whether or not they study the Course and whether or not they believe that they are separated individuals, do they still become one with God automatically after death? Once you are one with God, why would you long for a body again and choose to reincarnate!",
    "output": "The way the Course views death is quite different from the way we ordinarily view it and the way religions have traditionally viewed it. Unlike practically all traditions east and west, the Course teaches that we do not have to wait for the body to die to become one with God--death of the body has nothing to do with whether or not we are one with God. That is solely a matter of the decision our minds make--to continue to believe that we are not one with God, or to deny that denial of the truth. The purpose of the miracle is to reverse the ego perception that the body is a real, independent entity that houses the soul that is released upon the death of the body. The miracle helps us realize that the body is a thought that never leaves its source in the mind and does nothing other than represent the mind's decision (\"the outside picture of inward condition\" [T-21.in.1:5]). The critical factor therefore is the decision we make in our minds to be or not to be as God created us. When we accept the truth of our oneness, and reject the illusion of separation from God, our minds, now free of guilt are guided solely by love, and that may or may not result in the laying aside of the body. Death in this state of mind is simply a decision; there is no waiting for the body to die so that one can return home. (See The Song of Prayer for a discussion of death as a right-minded choice [S-3.II].) Love may need the body as a suitable form of expression for other minds still frightened of abstract love. But if you are in the real world, you would already know that the body is not your identity--you are fully present to love, and love is fully present to you. The body has nothing to do with that. Moreover, in the real world there would be no you (a separate identity) that would decide whether to help others \"left behind.\" There is only the perception of the Holy Spirit: love is either being expressed or called for. And those calling for love await but their own decision to accept what is already within. Finally, to ask why, if you are one with God, would you long for a body again and choose to reincarnate is to fall into one of the ego's favorite traps, for to ask the question is to assume that it happened once before; and the Atonement principle is a statement of the impossibility of that ever happening at all. Moreover, it makes the body into the enemy ... and therefore real."

    "text_input": "Q #566: I understand that A Course in Miracles teaches that God does not know about the world, and as far as He is concerned we are one with Him dreaming of exile and separation. I am not clear how the decision was made to send us Jesus and the Holy Spirit; Jesus in charge of the Atonement and the Holy Spirit as our Voice, Comfort, and Guide. How did our Teacher even know we had and are continuing to make such a mess of things?",
    "output": "A reasonable question, asked by almost every student in one form or another. The statements in the Course pertaining to the Holy Spirit as being sent by God as the Answer to the separation are among those meant metaphorically. Other statements are meant literally; and if this distinction is not recognized, the Course can seem to be saying contradictory things, leaving a reader feeling rather baffled. The account of the separation and its undoing are presented as mythology, specifically within a framework that is meaningful to people in Western philosophical and religious traditions. The language used in the Course to present its teachings reflect these heritages; and further, a considerable part of its teachings are clearly corrections of what it views as the mistakes of biblically based religions. Its basic metaphysics is a strict non- dualism, which means therefore that it is not quite accurate to say that as far as God is concerned, \"we are one with Him dreaming of exile and separation\"--that is dualism. If that were true, then a state other than that of perfect Oneness is possible, which would be contrary to what is maintained throughout the Course. We return to these points frequently in our answers to students questions, because of their critical importance in students' work with the Course. We refer you to Love Does Not Condemn (pp. 419-21) for a full discussion of the Holy Spirit in the context of the metaphysical basis of A Course in Miracles. Briefly, the Course teaches that the Holy Spirit is really the memory of God's perfect love that remained in the Son's mind when he fell asleep; and therefore the Holy Spirit is not a person, but rather a Presence within each seemingly fragmented mind--a Call or a Voice, not of a separate being, but simply a part of the mind that retains the memory of its true Identity. The language used is biblical; thus, terms like Comforter. In keeping with the strict non-dualism of the Course, we would therefore have to say that God's \"Answer\" is really, to quote from Love Does Not Condemn: \"His own unchanging and eternal love that forever shines in our split minds, as does a beacon of light shine out into the darkness. God's love does not do anything; it simply is: an ongoing state of love's presence which we call the Holy Spirit\" (pp. 420-21). Jesus, then, is the manifestation of the Holy Spirit--a symbol in our minds that have become so identified with specifics that we can relate most comfortably and meaningfully only to specifics. Thus, in his loving gentleness as our teacher, he ultimately reflects to us the love that we have split off from our awareness. We relate to him as a separate person at first, but as we grow to trust him more and experience his love more and more, the differences between ourselves and Jesus fade until we, like him, are totally identified with love. Our individuality lessens in significance and meaning as this process takes place, which begins with our feeling that he has been sent and ends with our complete transcendence of that and all other concepts of separation."

I am kind of stuck in that I feel that the only way that I can begin to make some money is to get a job with commission. What would you advise?",
    "output": "Purpose is everything! If the content in your mind is that your position in sales is a classroom in which you can be guided by Jesus or the Holy Spirit to undo the separation, there will be no conflict. You will then do whatever competent sales people do, but for a different purpose--not to intentionally manipulate others to get what you want, which could only result in guilt and conflict. Your purpose, as you carry out your responsibilities conscientiously, would be to recognize more and more that the only aspect of value in your interaction with your customer is your learning that you both share the same interests: you both have a split mind and a decision maker that can choose to follow either the ego's thought system of separation or the Holy Spirit's thought system of forgiveness. That is the content; and that is what makes you a teacher of God, not the form (the role), as Jesus states in A Course in Miracles: \"A teacher of God is anyone who chooses to be one. His qualifications consist solely in this; somehow, somewhere he has made a deliberate choice in which he did not see his interests as apart from someone else's\" (M-1.1:1-2). The Holy Spirit can use anything we made to harm (everything in the world!) to heal our minds of their mistaken belief in sin, guilt, and fear (T-25.VI.4-6).

Consciousness ... all predicated on the reality of a self ... are outside the Mind of God. They are illusory ... so they can not be contained within His reality--nor ours, as His undifferentiated Son ... \" I have (at least) two questions:  : I, as the undifferentiated Son, cannot even seem to have a thought of separation. So, who is this \"I\" that seems to have the thought of separation (even though he may not even have such a thought)? To whom does it seem that he does? It seems to mean that the dreamer and the dream arise as one, together, where the dreamer is part of the dream itself, that the dreamer himself is an illusion--that is, that since the dreamer is an illusion, does not exist, that the fact that he dreams or even seems to dream is an illusion; that is, that the illusion itself does not exist, is an illusion. That is, to say that both the dreamer and the dream which includes the dreamer is a contradictory statement and thus has no meaning; that is, it itself is an illusion.  : If one claims that something is an illusion, then that something cannot be in the Mind of God. Thus, the ego, et al, is an illusion, does not exist and is not in the Mind of God. Thus, it is true that the ego is an illusion. But the fact that it is an illusion is itself not an illusion, since then the ego would exist. Thus the illusion is real--the ego does not exist. Thus, although the ego is not in the Mind of God, it must be that the illusion, being true, and thus real, must be in the Mind of God, since all that is true, and therefore real, is in the Mind of God.",
    "output": "Our answer to your questions is founded on the guidelines Jesus presents in the Introduction to the clarification of terms at the end of the manual: \"This is not a course in philosophical speculation, nor is it concerned with precise terminology. It is concerned only with Atonement, or the correction of perception. The means of Atonement is forgiveness ...The ego will demand many answers that this course does not give. It does not recognize as questions the mere form of a question to which an answer is impossible\" (C-in.1:1- 3; 4:1-2). The message of the Course cannot be grasped through the use of logical reasoning alone, and it cannot be made to fit into categories that assume the reality of time and space. The source and content of the Course transcend discursive reason entirely. While logical reasoning may be a useful and necessary beginning, it cannot divulge the content of the words in the Course, which Jesus says \"are but symbols of symbols\" (M-21.1:9). It is necessary somewhere along the way to recognize the uselessness of all human structures for achieving the goals of the Course. Many mystics, paradoxically, have written about experience that is ultimately ineffable. There is no conceptual/linguistic system that can adequately express what is beyond all subject-object dichotomy: the immediacy of pure oneness; \"a oneness joined as one\" (T-25.I.7:1). \"Oneness is simply the idea God is. And in His Being, He encompasses all things. No mind holds anything but Him. We say 'God is,' and then we cease to speak, for in that knowledge words are meaningless\" (W-pI.169.5:1-4). While these statements are of profound metaphysical interest, the reader has not connected with their content if they do not resonate with an internal state, however dim that may be. Recall that the Course came in response to the request of two people to find a way of relating to people that got beyond hostility and divisiveness. It did not come as theological, metaphysical treatise, although its discourse is on a sophisticated intellectual level. The unmistakable implication of much of what is said in the Course, however, is that discursive reasoning is a defense against the truth, and therefore can be an interference. This, even though the Course is replete with compelling \"arguments,\" and one might justifiably object that this answer has done the same. We are to use its words and logic, in a spirit of humility, to get beyond words and logic. Similarly, Jesus says of time: \"It should be emphasized, however, that ultimately no compromise is possible between everything and nothing. Time is essentially a device by which all compromise in this respect can be given up. It only seems to be abolished by degrees, because time itself involves intervals that do not exist\" (T-2.VII.5:10-12). As all students are aware, the exercises in part I of the workbook rely heavily on clock time--but only as part of Jesus' program of thought-reversal, not because time is real. This training leads to the restoration of our minds to the state of complete abstraction, \"the natural condition of the mind\" (W-pI.161.2:1). And, finally, Jesus reigns us in, protecting us from harming ourselves even further by reminding us, \"You are still convinced that your understanding is a powerful contribution to the truth, and makes it what it is. Yet we have emphasized that you need understand nothing\" (T-18.IV.7:5-6)."

    "text_input": "Q #569: In Kenneth's Commentary on the Text of A Course in Miracles (Chapter 12), he states the following: \"I interpret your attack on me as unjustified, which secretly means I know it is justified because I attacked you first, in my mind.\" Would you please clarify this dynamic?",
    "output": "Any interpretation our mind joined with the ego gives to external circumstances inevitably implies a belief in its opposite as well, because the ego thought system is a dualistic system predicated on the belief in opposition. Whatever we experience consciously is only half of the oppositional \"whole\" that the ego has split apart through projection to make differences and attack real. And so we do not recognize that the two halves are really the same (T-6.II.1-3; T- 27.II.12-14). Because of the dynamic of projection, I can only see attack in you if I have first seen it within myself. In fact, metaphysically, you exist solely as the projection of my attack thoughts so that I do not have to accept responsibility for them myself. My anger at you for your \"unjustified\" attack is merely the defense against the unconscious guilt over my self-accusation that I am the attacker, deserving of punishment and attack in return. The paradoxical nature of the ego thought system is such that whatever I protest most vociferously about against you is always a projection of what I secretly believe about myself--that is always the case, with no exceptions (T-6.in.1). And that is one of the uncompromising teachings of the Course that makes it so difficult for students to accept, if not in principle, certainly in practice. In reality, from the Holy Spirit's perspective, neither ego interpretation--about you or about myself--is true. The Holy Spirit does not take sides but rather first helps us to recognize that both halves are the same--my brother and I are one. And then He dismisses both interpretations as false because they are based on the faulty premise that separation, differences, and attack are real (T-5.VI.10; T22.VI.12-13; T-27.II.15-16). In other words, the oppositional \"whole\" of the attacking ego is an illusion, so no matter how it is sliced, nothing real or true can follow from it."

Recently we had a baby girl. I'm thinking of leaving so my child will not be subject to this behavior and I would have left already if it wasn't for our new baby girl. We have been going to counseling but it seems we just  keep going over the same old issues. Since reading A Course in Miracles I'm not sure what is the right thing to do. I'm not sure when the Holy Spirit speaks to me or what would be the most loving thing to do. Can you help me with this?",
    "output": "Our lives present us with many dilemmas for which it seems critical that we make the right decision so that we don't make mistakes with serious consequences and can minimize the pain and suffering for ourselves and others. And from the world's perspective, this concern for choosing the right alternative seems eminently reasonable. But the Course turns the \"logic\" of the world upside down and invites us to take a very different approach to our problems (T- 27.VII.1-2). The problem is not the external relationship and its conflicts. The problem is that we have defined for ourselves the parameters of the conflict and the possible solutions for which we seek guidance. And our approach to the situation, by focusing on the external relationship, ends up excluding ourselves from the only meaningful solution (W-pI.79). I can only experience conflict with others when I am identified with my ego, and that identification is the problem with which I need help. In other words, the Holy Spirit's only purpose is to help me heal the unforgivenesses in my own mind that are being projected onto the external situation. Once I have accepted that help, which has nothing to do with the other person or persons, then I will simply know the most loving and peaceful action to take to address the external situation. But so long as I keep my focus on the relationship with others and am not willing to look at my inner conflict, I am asserting my unwillingness to be open to the real solution. So, in practical terms, what does this mean in terms of the specific relationship with your wife that you describe? You would want to begin by looking at all the judgments you may be holding onto about your wife, the ways in which you see her as somehow responsible for your unhappiness, the investment you have in wanting her to be different from how she is before you can accept her. This is an internal inventory of your thoughts and feelings and it has nothing to do with any decision about separating or staying together. The goal is simply to acknowledge the judgments you are projecting onto her and then to ask yourself whether you would accuse yourself of these same things (W-pI.134.9). Not that the specific actions will necessarily be the same, but you want to get to the underlying meaning or content. Are you accusing her of being irresponsible, unavailable, unwilling, thinking only about herself, etc., and could that ever be said about you? The truth is, we could never be upset at someone else's actions or inactions if we didn't first believe those things about ourselves. And that is where the healing is really needed, to get in touch with and then let go of the guilt in our own mind so that we don't need to project it onto anyone else. Now this is not to deny or excuse or justify any of your wife's shortcomings. But you want to release yourself from the self-condemnation so that you can release her from any condemnation as well. Through this process of forgiveness, you would then come to recognize the fear underneath your wife's defenses, and the call for love in both of you (T-12.I.3-7). From this place of acceptance and peace, you would recognize the most loving next step for all of you. And whether you and your wife separate or remain together, you would be able to act without guilt or attack. Several earlier Questions #11, #43, and #77 on hearing the Voice of the Holy Spirit, may also be helpful to review."

    "text_input": "Q #571: A Course in Miracles teaches that the world I see is the world that I have projected with my mind. It also says that once all illusions have been brought to the Holy Spirit for forgiveness,  I will see a beautiful world, not unlike Heaven. Jesus reached this state, but the world he was seeing was still one in which he was nailed to a cross and murdered, hardly representative of the \"real\" world referred to the Course.",
    "output": "When the Course speaks of the real world it is referring to the content of the mind, rather than the physical world seen with the body's eyes. As you point out, Jesus saw the actions of those who crucified him and saw himself on the cross, but he knew these things did not mean anything because he did not identify with the body. While the ego tells us the crucifixion is the height of victimization, Jesus calls it a \"useless journey\" (T-6.I.2:6). That is the view from the real world; it does not mean wearing rose colored glasses, changing what the body is doing or feeling, or being surrounded by physical beauty. Knowing who he is as God's innocent Son, Jesus sees only wholeness and does not see himself as a victim. He is defenseless because he knows he cannot be harmed, and he is therefore free to see things as they really are. Thus, not mistaking illusion for truth is what constitutes the real world. Since what is illusion has no effects, the events of the illusory world are seen as meaningless. For students of the Course this is accomplished through the Atonement process, in which every relationship is transformed through forgiveness. The real world escapes us as long as we cling to our identity with the body, and choose to believe that the world holds something (anything) that we want. \"The real world can actually be perceived. All that is necessary is a willingness to perceive nothing else\" (T-11.VII.2:6-7). When a choice is finally made to accept only the true perception of the Holy Spirit, which is a choice not to believe the ego's lies about who we are, the seeming pain and terror of the world as the body sees it will disappear from awareness. Thus is the goal of learning accomplished; love replaces fear completely and the real world is attained. It is this awareness of love's presence that is not unlike Heaven, and precedes it in our experience: \"Perceiving only the real world will lead you to the real Heaven, because it will make you capable of understanding it\" (T-11.VII.3:9).

    "text_input": "Q #572: I have been studying A Course in Miracles for several years, but I am still perplexed by some things. Recently there was a news program describing the benefits of prayer on healing the body. It was one of the \"so called double blind\" studies where neither the participants nor the controllers knew which patients were being prayed for. But the study proved that the group being prayed for improved dramatically over the patients not being prayed for. What I don't understand is, what is going on here? If God does not work in this world and the Holy Spirit or Jesus does not heal the body in this world, how can this be happening to such a degree that people believe that they are healed by prayer? I understand the ladder of prayer in the \"Song of Prayer\" pamphlet, and it appears that this is asking out of need, the lowest level of prayer. Is this just another ego trick or am I missing something here?",
    "output": "Without getting into the irrelevant issue of whether or not the specific study reported was \"good science,\" drawing sound conclusions from empirically sound research design and procedures, we'll assume the validity of the findings for the sake of discussion. From the Course's perspective, the improvement of bodily symptoms is always the result of the mind's own decision to bring about physical change in its projected bodily form (M-5.II.2). God, the Holy Spirit and Jesus have nothing to do with physical recovery. And no other mind brings about the change--it is only ever the result of the willingness of the patient's own mind. Whether or not, as part of the research design, information about who is praying for whom is conveyed to the patients is irrelevant, since minds are joined and it is only at this level that any kind of communication takes place. And as to whether these findings are an ego trick or the result of right-minded release of guilt through an experience of joining really depends on the mind of each individual patient--either avenue to the release of bodily symptoms is possible. For more on the relationship between prayer and healing, you may wish to refer to #385."

    "text_input": "Q #573: In regard to #356, I am curious about what biblical terms in A Course in Miracles have different meanings from the traditional ones? I am Christian and love the messages of the gospel. I also love the messages in the Course. I don't see the differences or a conflict as I believe they are both from God. I do believe some traditions have corrupted the original message of Christ. Is that what you are referring to? If that is the case, how do YOU discern between the traditions?",
    "output": "The short answer to your question is that most the terms in the Course have different meaning from the Bible. That is because they are based on a thought system that is different from the belief system of the Bible. The foundation of both the Old and New Testaments is the belief that sin is real and requires some form of retribution or atonement through sacrifice to earn salvation (Heaven) and thus avoid punishment (hell). The crucifixion of Jesus is the highest expression of this thought system. Jesus' death on the cross atoned for the original sin of Adam and Eve and reopened the gates of Heaven for all Christian believers. In the dualistic belief system of the Bible, God, as Creator, is a being distinct from His creation, which is understood to be the physical universe, including human beings endowed with a spirit or soul. These basic beliefs hold true whatever other interpretations or distortions are introduced by the many sects and churches professing Christianity. A Course in Miracles, on the other hand, is a non-dualistic thought system that teaches \"There is no separation of God and His creation\" (T-8.V.2:8), \"There is no sin\" (T-26.VII.10:5), and \"There is no world!\" (W-pI.132.6:2). These fundamental principles of the Course are what give different meaning to the biblical terms that Jesus uses. In the Course, salvation/Atonement is a process of accepting the truth of these statements, recognizing that it is only the choice to believe in separation that makes it real in our experience and is the cause of the guilt that makes the body and the world seem real. Because there is no sin, there is no need for atonement through sacrifice, but only correction. The Course teaches that, rather than a means of redemption, the crucifixion is an extreme example of Jesus' teaching that we are minds not bodies, and cannot be harmed in any way by anything external to the mind. This is what is meant by the section in the text where Jesus speaks of the crucifixion: \"The real meaning of the crucifixion lies in the apparent intensity of the assault of some of the Sons of God upon another. This, of course, is impossible, and must be fully understood as impossible\" (T-6.I.3:4-5). Thus, the terms used in the Bible and the Course are not in conflict. They simply represent fundamentally distinct thought systems. That is not to say, however, that the Bible does not have passages that reflect the loving content of the right mind, just as followers of the Bible could recognize right minded passages in the Course. Like everyone else, scripture writers had access to the Holy Spirit, Who is the part of the mind that holds the memory of God. An example of this is the beautiful Gospel story of the Prodigal Son, which Jesus uses in the Course (See: T-8.VI.4). For our learning process, the important thing is to choose a thought system that helps us get in touch with the loving content of the Holy Spirit in our minds. In A Course in Miracles that would be through the process of forgiveness (see #206). The form (words, terms) is not important. More information regarding the Bible and A Course in Miracles can be found in A Course in Miracles and Christianity: A Dialogue and The Message of A Course in Miracles by Kenneth Wapnick."

    "text_input": "Q #574: I understand Jesus' remarks in his section from A Course in Miracles, \"What is the role of words in healing?\" (M-21); he says that over time we learn to let our words be chosen for us and that a major hindrance to this aspect of learning is our \"fear about the validity\" of what we hear. I am training now to be a teacher and I let Jesus speak through me and am learning how to discern more and more and sometimes what I hear is indeed startling and \"has nothing to do with the situation\" as I perceive it. Sometimes I am embarrassed but I usually calm down. I guess implicit in this question is me \"second-guessing\" God and thinking that I know better than He does but sometimes I am just startled at what I said and the other person is too. Can you help offer some insight here?",
    "output": "To the Holy Spirit (and Jesus as His manifestation), everything is either an expression of love or a call for love. He sees the larger picture of everyone's Atonement path and is not limited by what we normally see as the boundaries of our lives in the world. Form is completely irrelevant to the Holy Spirit. And therefore His response to calls for love would be in terms of where people are on their Atonement paths, which is not something we ordinarily are in touch with. That is why what we hear may be startlingly different from what we think we should say. In the section you refer to, Jesus explains that our doubts and discomfort when this happens come from a \"shabby self-perception,\" which we would do well to \"leave behind\" (M-21.5:4-5). So that is what Jesus advises us to do in this aspect of our training. It means that we need to develop our ability to recognize our underlying self-images--specifically the ones that include a sense of inadequacy, neediness, specialness, and being unfairly treated. The more we hold onto self- images such as these, the less likely we would be to accurately discern the Holy Spirit's Voice from the ego's voice, because our holding onto them implies that we know better than Jesus who we really are, even after hearing him say again and again, \"you are as God created you.\" Thus, the trouble we have in humbly accepting Jesus at his word leads to the difficulties in our ability to hear accurately.

    "text_input": "Q #575: With respect to #365 re the child's role in child abuse, what is the adult role in such a relationship? Clearly, the adult is not telling God \"look at how I suffer.\"",
    "output": "As is well known, many abusing adults were once themselves abused, and probably would be sustaining an unspoken accusation against their own abusers: \"I can't help doing what I'm doing; it's not my fault. After all, look what happened to me!\" This is another way of keeping separation real, yet having someone else be responsible for it. Moreover, anyone who attacks another person (whether child or adult) is harboring a self-accusation of unforgivable sinfulness that is so tormenting that it must be projected from the mind and seen in a body and attacked there. The ego's ultimate strategy is to keep us focused on the body--one of its favorite means being the perception of victimization--so that we would rarely, if ever, suspect that the mind is the source of both sin and salvation from sin. This ego strategy, thus, is at the root of the need to find fault with what other bodies do and then punish them through habitual abuse, whether physical or psychological. Jesus has described this strategy in the section of A Course in Miracles called \"The Self-Accused\" (T-31.III). So in some way, the abusing adult is pleading with God, saying, \"I know I'm mean, vicious, and cruel, but it's not my fault!\" The ego has achieved one of its major goals in this process insofar as the process validates the reality of the victim/victimizer cycle. The foundation supporting the entire thought system of the ego is sin: that there is a guilty victimizer and an innocent victim. This is the cycle the ego seeks to perpetuate in our relationships in the world, lest we hear another Voice within our minds calling us to remember the truth of our innocence with respect to our relationship with God our Source. If there were no accusation of sin on that ultimate level, the concept of victimization would never have arisen, and obviously there would be no need to project it onto bodies. So an abusing adult is one of the outcomes of the need to do something about the excruciating pain of self-hatred (sinfulness) thought to be the core of our identity (W-pI.93.1). This, in effect, defines the ego's purpose for life in the body--it is the chosen route of escape from the pain and fear in the mind. The source of victimization thus is always in bodies (psychological or physical), never in the mind's acceptance of the ego's made-up story of ontological sin, guilt, and fear."

    "text_input": "Q #576: Let me see if I have this right--all of this world and everything in it is a thought we are all having--part of a tiny, mad idea that slipped into the sleeping Son's mind for just one tiny instant. In fact my identity as the person I think I am is just a fragment in the dream of Christ-- and everyone in the dream is also a fragment in the dream and we are all dreaming, or rather One of us is dreaming he is many yet in truth he is not--just for an instant dreaming but still dreaming. So my big question is--how did Jesus get into the dream and know that it was just a dream? If it's true that it must have been the \"right\" part of the Christ-mind that sent him-- which I think means in truth the Oneness of the Sonship sent him--how did he get here without being affected by the illusion. I mean how did he come with the knowledge that it was not real? I can understand that perhaps one can figure it out but it seems that he came with it figured out-- how is that possible?",
    "output": "First of all, a point of clarification. A Course in Miracles does not refer to Christ as having fallen asleep and dreaming. Christ is the extension of the Mind of God that has never forgotten Its true Identity. The Course uses the Son of God to refer both to the Christ and to the illusory part--the split mind--that seems to have fallen asleep and had a dream of separation from God. But in reality, the dream has never happened and Christ remains unaffected (W-pII.6:1-3). As for your \"big question\"--it is helpful to remember that the story of the Son of God falling asleep and dreaming of a world of separation from his Father is a myth, a set of symbols to correct the story the ego has told us of sin, guilt and fear, and an angry Father bent on destroying His Son for his attack on Him. The Mind outside the dream is not acting on the dream to awaken the sleeping Son and all the fragments that he has seemingly splintered into. And there is no Jesus from outside the dream who could be \"sent\" into the dream. There is a memory of oneness that remains in the mind of the Son after he seems to have fallen asleep. And that memory can be symbolically represented either more abstractly by the Holy Spirit or more specifically and concretely by the figure of Jesus (among other figures who represent awakening). But both are symbols for that memory we carried into the dream, which is present in each separate fragment--all our various individual identities. Just as when you are sleeping and dreaming at night and some figures in your dream may represent your ego guilt and fears, and others may be symbols of your right-minded sanity, so too the figures in our collective waking dream may serve the same functions. And just as there is no one outside our mind sending figures into our sleeping dreams, it is the split mind itself manifesting symbols in our waking dreams to represent the only two choice that are available to us--continuing to sleep and dream or moving towards awakening. You may also find #473 on Jesus helpful, as well as Kenneth's audio set, Jesus: Symbol and Reality."

    "text_input": "Q #577: What does A Course in Miracles say about karma, particularly in regard to healing?",
    "output": "You may wish to look at #514i, as well as #363 for more in-depth discussions of the Course and karma. Karma is the impersonal law of cause and effect, which operates within the world of time and space, where every thought and action has a consequence. It has its origins in the thought of separation, where cause and effect are split off from each other and seem to proceed in a linear fashion over time, so that the past has implications for the present and the future. Since time is an illusion, karma, even separated from any judgmental implications, must remain within an ego framework. And so healing, from a karmic perspective, would involve releasing a past debt through some kind of payment (e.g., sickness or suffering) now or in the future. The Course view of healing is very different from this linear process. Nothing from the past can be the cause of what I am experiencing in the present, because there is no past. The cause is always a thought that I am holding in the present. Thought alone, according to the Course, is the cause of whatever we experience. If we wish a different experience, all we need do is change our thinking (or the guide we have chosen for our thinking). And this change does not take any time. As Jesus explains in \"The Laws of Healing,\" \"All sickness comes from separation. When the separation is denied, it goes. For it is gone as soon as the idea that brought it has been healed, and been replaced by sanity\" (T-26.VII.2:1-3). But for this change of mind to occur, we must become aware of what we unconsciously believe about the cause of sickness. The Course uses the word sickness to encompass more than physical symptoms--seeing the body as sick in the first place means the mind is sick (T-28.II.11:7). And in fact, the Course asserts that it is not the body that is sick (T-29.II.8:1-2). And so Jesus continues, \"Sickness and sin are seen as consequence and cause, in a relationship kept hidden from awareness that it may be carefully preserved from reason's light\" (T- 26.VII.2:4). This relationship is one we accept and believe, but it operates only because we choose to believe it. This is true whether we are speaking of karmic laws or the ego's \"laws.\" \"Guilt asks for punishment, and its request is granted. Not in truth, but in the world of shadows and illusions built on sin. The Son of God perceived what he would see because perception is a wish fulfilled\" (T-26.VII.3:1-3). Now for most of us, our investment in the ego thought system and the individual identity it offers us prevents us from experiencing the immediate release that this shift in thought offers. And this lag is one the ego would interpret as proof that time is necessary to heal. But it is only our own fear that prevents us from accepting the healing now. The reason for our resistance and fear is very clearly spelled out in the section on healing in the manual: \"The acceptance of sickness as a decision of the mind, for a purpose for which it would use the body, is the basis of healing ... there is no form of sickness that would not be cured at once. What is the single requisite for this shift in perception? It is simply this; the recognition that sickness is of the mind, and has nothing to do with the body. What does this recognition \"cost\"? It costs the whole world you see, for the world will never again appear to rule the mind. For with this recognition is responsibility placed where it belongs; not with the world, but on him who looks on the world and sees it as it is not. He looks on what he chooses to see. No more and no less. The world does nothing to him. He only thought it did. Nor does he do anything to the world, because he was mistaken about what it is. Herein is the release from guilt and sickness both, for they are one. Yet to accept this release, the insignificance of the body must be an acceptable idea\" (M-5.II.2:1,13; 3). We see in here the Course's correction to the law of karma--the world does nothing to us and we have done nothing to the world. There is no world, only a dream of a world, and so there is no debt to be paid, except in dreams."

    "text_input": "Q #578: I have had some very strong feelings about one presidential candidate in particular, but now realize that that is ego running wild. I have asked to see differently, and now realize that he is running frightened and asking for love. My feelings are becoming more peaceful, and I am able to bless this person some of the time, but I am confused by the idea of voting. Since this is indeed an illusory world, why should I bother to vote at all? How should I look at the coming elections in November?",
    "output": "Since we believe we are bodies living in the world, the fact that the world is an illusion does not stop us from taking part in any of the normal activities we engage in: sleeping, eating, working, exercising, watching movies, or participating in elections. We do these things because we think we are here, and they are part of our experience as bodies. Jesus tells us early in the text that we should not deny that we have chosen to identify with the body (T-2.IV.3). In fact, doing so means denying ourselves the learning opportunities that are essential to the Holy Spirit's curriculum of healing. The political arena, especially elections, affords us a very interesting opportunity to look at a vast array of judgments so they can be given to the Holy Spirit for correction. Very few people escape the charge of feelings around elections. These feelings range from a strong determination not to be involved, to strong judgments in favor of, or against candidates or groups. One may choose to vote or not to vote for many reasons, but it is not the metaphysics of A Course in Miracles that provides the guideline for this behavior. The Course is teaching us only to change our minds through the process of forgiveness, not to change our behavior. This means recognizing, not denying, the ego thought system that underlies our beliefs and judgments, so it can be transformed by the Holy Spirit. The Course teaches that the world is the domain of the ego, that it was chosen as a substitute for Heaven. We have established its political structures as the foundation of organized society governing the way we live in the world. It is understandable, then, that politics is a very powerful symbol of the ego's thought system, and politicians are significant authority figures. Both politics and politicians are, therefore, fertile fields for a very important cornerstone of the ego: the authority problem. When we choose to believe the separation is real, we make this choice because we want to create ourselves; to \"be our own person.\" In doing so we believe we are usurping God's power: \"The issue of authority is really a question of authorship. When you have an authority problem, it is always because you believe you are the author of yourself and project your delusion onto others. You then perceive the situation as one in which others are literally fighting you for your authorship. This is the fundamental error of all those who believe they have usurped the power of God\" (T-3.VI.8:1-4). We decide for ourselves who we are (separate bodies), rather than accept who God tells us we are (His one innocent Son). Guilt for committing this \"sin\" is projected on to authority figures, whom we accuse of all kinds of \"sins\": lying, abandoning us, betraying us, neglecting our needs, stealing from us. These are all recognizable accusations hurled at politicians and governments, along with other significant authority figures. In every accusation we find the victimization theme, and all the feelings we associate with authority. This is the projected version of our authority problem with God. It is the \"root of all evil\" (T- 3.VI.7) because it has its birth in the original decision to separate from God and identify with the ego. Thus it is our conflict with God over authorship of our identity that is behind all thoughts and feelings associated with elections, politicians, and politics in general. No wonder political debates and discussions are heated. All parties (pardon the pun) are \"right.\" The ego tells us we are right about being bodies, being in the world, being liberal or conservative, being different in millions of ways, and right about voting or not voting. The Holy Spirit tells us we are wrong about who we are, and the only thing we can be right about is learning to identify with His definition of our Identity. As we experience the next few months of election activity, we can look at all the feelings and judgments about candidates and voters alike, recognizing in them our own cherished choice for separation. This is the way we see differently, and is the first step in forgiving ourselves for our mistaken judgment. However right we may be about a candidate's superior suitability for office, if we judge the \"other guy\" as the sinner responsible for our distress, we are wrong. That is the important thing for us to learn at the polls in November, and in everything else as well."

    "text_input": "Q #579: Over the past two years or so I have made a conscious effort to remember the moments and periods during my life when I actually feel peaceful. They are far and few between and always seem to be swallowed up as my familiar fears, concerns, etc., come flooding back in. One of the answers,#355, used the analogy that each of these moments can be thought of as a golden thread. As you have more and more of them the thread becomes a string, the string a rope, until you can climb out. This is my favorite image and has greatly helped me during difficult times. I have come to realize the enormity of my resistance to having these experiences but have also realized it is all right. These moments are always associated with forgiveness of some darkness in my mind, if only for a little while. However, there are certain seemingly minor events in my life that evoke such feelings of self-hatred and shame that have more recently come back to me from the distant past. Could it be my ego is \"fighting back\" as my separate identity is challenged?",
    "output": "The ego will always pull out all the stops in an attempt to preserve itself, and that certainly can explain at least in part your experience. But it may also be helpful to think of these old memories as resurfacing now because you are increasingly willing to look at the darkness and bring all of its various expressions in your mind up into your awareness so you can make a different choice about them. Although the thoughts seem to be about events from the past, they are simply symbols of guilt, which you are still holding onto now, that are buried in your unconscious, where they continue to operate out of your awareness, robbing you of peace. By allowing them to come up into your conscious awareness, you are giving yourself another opportunity to release them into the light. The feelings associated with these thoughts, as you remember the past, may not be comfortable, but if you can learn to begin to welcome both the thoughts and the feelings as the opportunity for forgiveness that they present, they will increasingly lose their power to disrupt your peace. Nor will they continue to operate at a subterranean level in your mind, like seismic forces that affect you on the surface without your feeling as if you have any choice about the effects. In A Course in Miracles, Jesus introduces a discussion of ego \"dynamics\" with reassuring words that can just as easily be applied to your specific experiences: \"No one can escape from illusions unless he looks at them, for not looking is the way they are protected. There is no need to shrink from illusions, for they cannot be dangerous. We are ready to look more closely at the ego's thought system because together we have the lamp that will dispel it, and since you realize you do not want it, you must be ready. Let us be very calm in doing this, for we are merely looking honestly for truth. The \"dynamics\" of the ego will be our lesson for a while, for we must look first at this to see beyond it, since you have made it real. We will undo this error quietly together, and then look beyond it to truth\" (T-11.V.1)."

Is there any way of \"speeding up\" the process of accessing, and more importantly being continuously aware, of the loving presence in one's mind? Is there anything else to do other than working on letting go of the ego and then waiting patiently for that inner peace to appear?",
    "output": "Since Jesus is the symbol of the part of the mind that remembers God, and A Course in Miracles is one of the forms he has given us to help us awaken from the dream of separation and realize that we are at home in God, one meaningful way to develop a relationship with him is by reading, studying, and most importantly applying its teaching to our lives. The relationship becomes personal by applying Jesus' message of forgiveness to the specific relationships and events of our lives. (For more on forgiveness see #59.) Jesus asks only that we be willing to do this, and it is this willingness that determines the \"speed\" of the process of \"removing the blocks to awareness of love's presence\" (T-in.1:7). To the degree to which the relationship with Jesus is real, love's presence is kept in awareness, and inner peace is experienced as commensurate with the degree of our willingness to practice forgiveness. Jesus himself gives us the guidelines for our relationship with him: \"If you are willing to renounce the role of guardian of your thought system and open it to me, I will correct it very gently and lead you back to God\" (T-4.I.4:7). Although this process is clear and simple, it is not easy. That is because we are very attached to the ego's thought system of separation. We cling to our belief in the body and to our judgments about everything. However, as soon as we are willing to question our interpretation of any event in the light of the Course's teaching, we have reached out to take Jesus' hand. The forgiveness process begins with this questioning. The correction Jesus offers is another way of looking at every experience, interaction, thought or judgment we may have. The important thing is to apply the forgiveness Jesus teaches as often as we can. Each step we take toward letting go of our own judgment deepens our relationship with him, making him real to us. The speed of our progress is not our concern; in fact, we are told we have no idea how to evaluate our progress: \"Put yourself not in charge of this, for you cannot distinguish between advance and retreat. Some of your greatest advances you have judged as failures, and some of your deepest retreats you have evaluated as success\" (T-18.V.1:5-6). We are thus relieved of any sense of urgency on our journey. For more on our relationship with Jesus see #271."

And immediately my mind responds by interpretations and assumptions and guesses. How do I know that what I experience is true, or would it be an illusion of goodness that my mind has made up, imitating the real stuff from God? I feel that I am not trusting at all even trying to ask you this.",
    "output": "Listening to the misgivings and suspicions of the ego is a wonderful way to tie ourselves up in \"nots.\" The most helpful thing to remember as all the doubts and questions arise is that it's not necessary (or even helpful!) to take all of this as seriously as you find yourself doing. Is it my ego or is it the Holy Spirit, our egos desperately ask, guaranteeing that our experience is anything but peaceful. But that's okay, it's just fear and fear is only temporary. If you can begin to recognize that the volley of thoughts that ricochet through your mind is nothing more that the voice of the ego and it doesn't have to be taken seriously, but it also doesn't have to be changed in any way, perhaps you can begin to allow yourself to relax a little more about the process. All we need to do is recognize our ego and then release any judgments we have about it. The Rest will follow naturally on Its own without our needing to be concerned or figure out anything. But once you find your mind heading again in the direction of needing to know and understand, all you have to do is acknowledge that your ego has stepped back in and would like to regain control of your mind to protect itself. If you can recognize your ego again, without trying to change it, it will begin to lose its ability to persuade you that it ought to be taken seriously. All it really merits is a smile of amusement."

    "text_input": "Q #582: Having been raised as a Catholic with a belief in \"original sin,\" I already believe I am \"guilty\" and \"defective\" as a human being. Furthermore, I have feelings of low self-esteem, shame, and I know I want to be liked by others. Are these feelings and this belief system equivalent to what A Course in Miracles describes as the guilt that arises from my ego's decision to be separate from God? I'm having trouble understanding the metaphysical principles of the Course as they apply to my understanding of guilt. I want to know if these two forms of guilt are \"identical\" because I am uncertain that I can identify the specific forms of guilt that I am trying to cover up. In my conscious self I already know that I feel guilty. In fact I take more responsibility for mistakes than is warranted. If these two forms of guilt are equivalent, perhaps I can reach the love and forgiveness the Course says lies underneath. Can you help me here?",
    "output": "Rather than equating the ontological guilt of the Course with \"original sin,\" it would be more accurate to describe the Course's teachings on guilt as correcting the Christian doctrine of \"original sin,\" as well as explaining the doctrine's origins in the ego thought system. The biblical story of Adam and Eve that recounts the original sin of the first parents in the Garden of Eden could be considered a symbolic out-picturing of the ego's myth of sin, guilt and fear. One of the major differences between Christianity and the Course is that Christianity asserts, whether it views the story as literal or symbolic, that sin--attack on God--is real and has had serious negative effects on our relationship with Him. The Course, in contrast, teaches that sin is not real, that our relationship with God has not been disrupted in any way, and that the only problem is our belief in sin. And so the correction or atonement for sin would be very different within each system. Christianity needs a savior figure to be sacrificed to God to undo the effects of our sinfulness, which we have inherited through the decision of our original parents to disobey God at a point distant in time. The Course says we ourselves are choosing in our minds right now to embrace a false belief in sin and separation and the only solution to this problem is to change our minds now about what we believe (more about this later). So within Christianity, guilt is very real--the result of the sinful acts of mankind against its Creator. The nature of the original sin is discussed and debated in various theological circles, but its reality is not really questioned. Within the Course, guilt is made up and is simply part of the ego's defense to prove to us that sin is real. God is not angry because nothing ever happened and so He does not need to be appeased. Furthermore, the world and our experiences as bodies in that world are not the outcome of God's creative activity but are the results of our feverish imagination to convince ourselves that the separation and attack on God are real. Any misdeeds by first parents or any guilty sins of omission or commission that we accuse ourselves of are simply part of the ego's smokescreen to keep us unaware of the decision we have made in our minds, and not in the world, to believe in sin and guilt. The Course would say that it is our acceptance of the ego's myth of sin, guilt and fear in our mind that has resulted in everything else: the story and the doctrine of original sin, the world of separate bodies with separate thoughts that can seem to make choices in opposition to God, and the feelings of guilt that seem to result from all those choices. So at a practical level, when you are in touch with all the feelings of guilt you describe, you are experiencing the effects of your choice to see yourself as separate, but the cause is buried deep within your mind and has nothing to do with the self you believe you are, which is only its effect. To repeat, that self is not God's creation but our mind's own miscreation, meant to distract us from the source of the problem, the decision for separation within our mind. But the feelings of guilt that we experience in relationship to this self in the world nevertheless can be used to direct us back to an awareness of that choice in our minds, if we do not impose our own interpretations on the meaning and cause of the feelings. Since not only the guilt and sin, but the self we believe we are, are all part of the illusion, it is not that easy for us to accept that the guilt and sin are not real, for then we are accepting that we are not real as well. That is why, in practicing the Course's process of forgiveness, we need the help--Jesus or the Holy Spirit--that comes from outside our thought system to release the guilt that we have made real. And that help is a reflection of the love that down deep we truly seek. So when we are willing to accept that help, we are already joined with the love and forgiveness that is buried underneath the belief in sin and guilt. And that joining is what allows us to know that the sin and guilt are not real and that nothing therefore must be done about them."

    "output": "Taken by itself, this is a puzzling passage. It is important to note, however, that it is being discussed in a specific context: Jesus is talking about the temporary need for corrective procedures in order to restore to our minds the awareness that \"fear is nothing and love is everything\" and that \"God has only one Son\"; no compromise in this is possible (T-2.VII.5:3; 6:1). Therefore \"world\" in this reference is the real world, the state of mind reflecting the transcendence of the ego, the healing of all belief in separation. Jesus refers to this passage again in Chapter 12, where he states explicitly that he means the real world (T-12.III.8). In this larger context, thus, Jesus is saying that the Atonement principle, the correction for our belief in fear and separation, is already in our minds. \"He gave it to His only begotten Son\" is a metaphorical expression of the Atonement principle. So Jesus is assuring us that we will not perish because of our perceived attack on God. We are already saved from this insane way of thinking about ourselves and God, and need but choose the correction already in our minds--this is the \"world\" God gave \"to His only begotten Son.\" That is the content behind the words."

    "text_input": "Q #584: In #371 you write the following: \"You will continue to act in ways that will help determine responsibility and appropriate consequences within the system for the abuse, as well as protect the child from further abuse--but you will do it all without judgment. And you will  have become a reminder for everyone involved that there is another way of looking at what has been happening that does not involve attack and blame.\"  What exactly is attack and blame? If I determine responsibility and appropriate consequences, is this not judgment and am I not blaming someone and is this not attack. Or am I confusing levels. At one level, the true mind, I judge no one as there is nobody and nothing to judge. In the illusion I act out the part as determined by the situation that I am in but being aware of the non- judgment in the true mind. Is this correct? If this is so, why can I never do this although I have known this fact for a while?",
    "output": "First of all, it may help to clarify that \"without judgment,\" as it is used in the above quote, means without condemnation. Even within the Course itself, judgment is used in two ways, one wrong-minded, which involves attack and blame, and the other right-minded, which involves discerning between what is true and what is false (e.g., T-4.IV.8:7-8). The ego's judgment reinforces the belief in separation, sin, and guilt, by seeing the accused as different from ourselves. Right-minded judgment always undoes our identification with the ego by helping us recognize how, at the level of content, we are all basically the same, struggling with the same ego thought system, although our specific ego expressions may look different. Jesus repeatedly tells us in A Course in Miracles that we are responsible for the choices we make and the consequences that follow from them (e.g., T-4.IV; T-21.II.2:3-6), but he is never condemning us for choosing our egos--there is no blame or attack involved in that judgment. But only if we can begin to recognize that we are responsible for what we experience can we begin to make a different choice. It is the ego, with its belief in sin, guilt and fear, that equates responsibility with blame, and consequences with punishment and attack. Jesus is trying to help us look at the consequences of our decisions without getting caught in the moral judgments the ego would want us to make about good and bad. He does use words like silly (e.g., W- pI.156.6:4-5) foolish (e.g.,T-21.I.2:1; W-pI.65.7) and insane (e.g.,T-27.VI.6:3) to describe our choices for the ego, but it is our own projection if we believe that he is condemning us. It is not that you are confusing levels, but that you are confusing form and content. It is not the specific action of evaluating another's responsibility in a situation and delivering consequences for transgressions that constitutes condemnation and attack. Always, we want to look honestly at our purpose behind our decisions and actions. Perhaps it would be helpful to think of how we might hold a young child responsible for an aggressive act, such as hitting a younger sibling, and then provide a consequence, such as a time out from his regular activities, to reinforce in the child's mind the importance of considering his actions more carefully. All this can be done without attack or blame. If we are acting from our right mind, our purpose could be to help the child understand and make a different choice in the future about how to deal with frustration and anger. The situation with the abuser can be viewed in exactly the same way. We can conclude that an adult is indeed an abuser who has hurt a young child, but we can reach that conclusion without anger or blame. Yes, at another level, the mind of the child has invited victimization, as all ego- identified minds do, and at a deeper level still, none of it is real. But Jesus is not asking us to deny our experiences here in the world. He is simply asking us to be willing to let go of our own ego judgments in a situation where we are ready to condemn and ask him for help in seeing everyone involved in a different light. And so we could also support giving an abuser a sentence to serve without our goal being to punish. To know our purpose requires an honest assessment of the thoughts in our mind about the abuser. To repeat, it is not the form of our decision that is important but the underlying content--do we see the abuser as sinful and different from us and deserving of punishment or as the same and simply in need of help. If we can not see the aggressive child and the abusing adult as the same, it is only because we are still identified with our ego, which asserts there is a hierarchy among illusions (T-23.II.2). Now most people in the world would see a difference between the child who has hit his sibling and the adult who has abused a child, but that only demonstrates how most of us are still identified with the ego thought system. And the shift to a different perspective is not something we can do on our own. We must turn to that gentle Presence in our mind that sees us all as children who believe we can deal with our own guilt and anger by hurting others in some way. We are all in need of help and that is what makes us all the same. And in my willingness to release all my brothers and sisters from condemnation, I learn how to release myself as well (T- 12.I.4-7). See also #484 for a related discussion on judgment and form and content."

Isn't that what our one elder brother did? It seems as though each one of us, as so called individuals, are called to come to that point as individuals. I have been told that when we accept all that the Course teaches, we will stand at the end of the \"carpet,\" look back on this illusory world, and wait for all others to meet with us as we take that final step, with God reaching out to help us cross into Heaven (a state of being, not a place). Am I incorrect in my understanding of the process?",

With regard to the second part, \"understanding the process\" includes taking into consideration that Jesus does not mean this literally; after all, the separation never really happened and time is illusory. So there really is no waiting, no carpet to be rolled up, and no final step that needs to be taken. Jesus is trying to reassure us that we will all be fine and everything will turn out all right. There is nothing to fear, as we might have been led to believe by the teachings of Judaism and Christianity. No one will be left behind, and no one will wind up in any other place but our eternal home, for we have never truly left it."

    "text_input": "Q #586: Growing up I had a minimal exposure to religion and wonder if you'd care to address the terms \"witness\" and \"witnessing\"? For example, it seems witnessing in religion is often related to preaching rather than witnessing one's own thoughts. Also, although the primary use of witness is clear in A Course in Miracles (aka, the observer, \"you,\" or decision-maker) there is one paragraph (T-1.IV.4) that uses witness and witnessing in a manner that is not clear to me. Also, what \"law\" is Jesus referring to in this same paragraph?",
    "output": "Webster's definition of witness applies to the term as used in the passage you refer to: \"...to be or give evidence of.\" This is also the usual meaning given to the term in the Course. In saying \"I will witness,\" Jesus tells us he is himself the evidence, or proof, that there is no death, no \"hell-fire.\" He does this by demonstrating that the crucifixion had no effect; though his body was killed, he did not die. To whatever extent we are willing to listen and learn from him, he will give us more evidence that what he teaches is true: \"I will witness for anyone who lets me, and to whatever extent he permits it.\" Witness in this sense is used in much the same way as teaching. We are told later in the text: \"Remember always that what you believe you will teach\" (T- 6.I.6:10). If we believe the Holy Spirit, we will teach, or \"witness to\" His message. This is not accomplished through any special form of preaching or direct teaching. By the very fact that we believe it, it will be perceived by others (consciously or unconsciously). In like manner, if we believe the ego's lies we will witness to the ego, thus reinforcing the separation thought in our minds and in our lives. Witnessing, in this sense, is the recognizable effect of a choice that is made in the mind to believe the ego or the Holy Spirit. Since we are always choosing either the Holy Spirit or the ego, we are always witnessing to one or the other. That is what Jesus means when he says we are always teaching: \" ... you cannot not teach\" (T-6.III.4:1). According to the Bible, the Messiah was to come in fulfillment of the law and the prophets. His coming was \"law\" in that it was a promise that a redeemer would come to atone for our sins. Jesus is referring to this scriptural phrase, saying he does indeed fulfill the law, or promise, but by reinterpreting it. He does so by teaching in A Course in Miracles that \"there is no sin\" (T- 26.VII.10:5), and that redemption lies in accepting this truth."

    "text_input": "Q #587: I am having trouble understanding attack as a call for love. If an attack is meant to push love away because it was getting too close, how is it calling for it at the same time?",
    "output": "Attack ultimately is a reaction to guilt and the fear of destruction by a vengeful God. No one would ever attack if there were no underlying self-accusation of sin (we first attacked God). This sinfulness results in overwhelming guilt that is projected and then seen and attacked (judged) in others. But coupled with this dynamic is a desperate plea to be told that God is not out for blood in retaliation for sin, and further, that the perceived attack on God itself never took place. In that sense, the attack is a call for love, and a call to be told we are wrong. We are all looking for some convincing evidence to prove that we are not \"the home of evil, darkness, and sin,\" as we believe we all are (W-pI.93.1:1). That is why in A Course in Miracles we are being trained to ask for help to perceive \"differently\": \"There is but one interpretation of motivation that makes any sense. And because it is the Holy Spirit's judgment it requires no effort at all on your part. Every loving thought is true. Everything else is an appeal for healing and help, regardless of the form it takes\" (T-12.I.3:1-4). We rise to this level of perception through our practice of forgiveness."

    "text_input": "Q #588: I have always prayed to God for guidance and help. Today I'm thinking, if God did not create this world, He would not help me in this world. How do I pray? Do I ask to die? I really don't want to leave what I created, even though it is not perfect in any way, shape, or form. I still love my creations and extensions (do I call people in my life extensions?). When I turn to right thinking, I become terrified. I am afraid of Heaven! How crazy is this?",
    "output": "Your thinking is no more, but just as crazy as the thinking of all the rest of us who continue to want this world to be our reality and fear is our true reality. A Course in Miracles, by the way, would refer to everything we have made with our egos as our miscreations (T-2.VII.3:8-15). And it is not the self we believe we are here in the world that is responsible for miscreating. This individual self is just one of the miscreations of our split mind, which has seemed to fall asleep and dream of a world separate from God. So it's not the self we think we are in the world that needs help, despite our experiences to the contrary, but the mind that is identifying with this illusory self and continuing to deny its real power to create by extending love, which has nothing to do with anything we seem to experience here in the world. So seeking the death of this illusory self we think we are would resolve nothing, for the death of an illusion does nothing to change our mind, which is the source of the illusion. You are right in concluding that God has nothing to do with this world since He was not involved in making it. But that does not mean we are not without a Source of Help--the Holy Spirit--Who represents God's Love for us while we believe we are here. It's just that the true help He offers us is not about changing anything about our illusory world and our personal circumstances, but rather is a help for reducing our fears about remembering who we really are. And that help is called forgiveness, which simply is a process of acknowledging that we don't really know what is going on, since we don't even know who we are! And so Jesus says that \"the only meaningful prayer is for forgiveness\" (T-3.V.6:3). Practically, this means that whenever we find ourselves wanting to judge a person or a situation or a circumstance, our prayer would simply be to ask for help from the part of our mind--the Holy Spirit or Jesus--that knows what the real problem is--that we have fallen asleep and are dreaming of a world that has nothing to do with who we really are. And each time we do that, our fear lessens a little more, the world seems just a little less serious for this is the happy dream, our sleep is not quite so deep, and we become just a little more willing to hear the Call to awaken (T-5.II.10:4-5; T-27.VII.14)."

    "text_input": "Q #589: Before A Course in Miracles, I thought that psychic powers or abilities were spiritual gifts from God and that the good people used them for good things and the bad people used them for evil. The discussion in the teachers manual gives me more understanding but I still have some questions. Can you explain what exactly are psychic powers and how they work in relationship to our split mind and the body? And if someone is aware of having psychic abilities, how is it best to use them? I have a few psychic abilities and the Course says these are strengths the Holy Spirit wants and needs. I think I understand the ego traps one could fall into but could you give me some suggestions or examples of how one could use psychic powers for a holy purpose?",
    "output": "If you remember that the Course says we are mind, existing outside of time and space, and that all minds are joined, or are seeming fragments of the one split mind, psychic powers lose some of their mystery. The only reason we think they are so special is because we mistakenly believe we are bodies, part of the ego's clever plan to keep us mindless (T-20.VI.11:1-3). Time and space are illusory constructs of the split mind that have been projected into an illusory world of form to keep us unaware of our minds and focused on the world and our bodies instead (T- 1.VI.3:4-6; T-26.VIII.1:3-5). Most psychic abilities involve accessing information that seems to be at a distance from where we see ourselves in time and space. But since time is not truly linear and everything in the split mind actually exists simultaneously (T-26.V.3:3-7), everything that has happened, seems to be happening now, or could happen in the future, is potentially available to each seemingly separate fragment. It is only a decision of each individual mind, often based on fear, that keeps all the information in the split mind from being accessible. The body and the brain have nothing to do with psychic powers, since they themselves are nothing but the projected images of the split mind. Information about bodies--past, present and future, dead or alive, born or unborn--is simply information about the images contained in the holographic mind, whether or not they appear to be projected into the world of form at any particular point in time and space (T-28.I.5:3-9). The mind is holographic in the sense that the whole is contained in each part. So then, reading past lives, talking to dead friends, relatives, and spirit guides, predicting the future (always a probabilistic venture since there are always options at the level of form from which the mind can choose), having awareness of what exists or is happening at locations at a distance or invisible to the eyes, are all easily understood once we recognize the holographic nature of the mind. Other less common psychic powers, such as psychic healing and altering things physically within the dimensions of time and space, that seem to \"defy physical laws,\" simply involve the ability of the mind to access and project changes in projected images in the hologram without seeming to follow the conventional \"law of cause and effect\" in the world, which is illusory anyway (T- 28.I.6:1-4). For it is always a decision at the level of the mind and not anything in the world that leads to changes in the world, but most of us are not in touch with that ego-based choice in the mind. If we easily allowed ourselves to recognize the power that rests in the mind, the world would soon lose its value as a defense, for we cannot be victims of a world that our minds control (M-5.II.1,3). And the ego's only but hidden purpose for the world and the body is to convince us that our pain does not come from a choice for separation in our mind but rather from a world over which we have no control, which victimizes us despite our best efforts as bodies to protect ourselves. So all psychic powers are ego-based, but we keep most of them out of conscious awareness because of their potential for challenging our belief in the reality of the illusion. The ego warns us of the dangers of psychic powers because its goal is to keep us mindless. But even if we discover we have such abilities, the ego will gladly provide interpretations of their \"special\" value that can minimize our recognition of what they mean about the mind so that we use them instead to reinforce our belief in magic, differences and specialness, as if they are special gifts divinely \"conferred\" on the special ones, as you once believed. A psychic power has been given to the Holy Spirit for His use when we do not decide ourselves how it should be used. Anything that can help us to expand our perspective beyond the limited time/space dimension we seem to be restricted to as bodies can be helpful, provided we use it as a means and not an end in itself (M-25.3:5), as the ego would have us do, for then it becomes an object of specialness. As Jesus observes in the section on psychic powers you refer to: \"Communication is not limited to the small range of channels the world recognizes ... The limits the world places on communication are the chief barriers to direct experience of the Holy Spirit, Whose Presence is always there and Whose Voice is available but for the hearing. These limits are placed out of fear, for without them the walls that surround all the separate places of the world would fall at the holy sound of His Voice. Who transcends these limits in any way is merely becoming more natural. He is doing nothing special, and there is no magic in his accomplishments\" (M-25.2:2,5-8). The only way to be confident that we have offered such abilities to the Holy Spirit--as with any talents we may possess--is first to be honest with ourselves about the ego-based reasons we personally would seek to display them. These could include accessing information to enable you to get what you want for yourself, impressing others with your spirituality, offering help to others for their problems as you perceive them, and so on. When you can identify your ego investments, you are in a position to release them and will also be more likely to recognize them when they may once again tempt you to seek after specialness. Any examples of the right-minded use of psychic powers must necessarily focus on the purpose and not the specific situation, since it is only ever the purpose that makes anything holy. And so a word of caution--if you think you know specifically the purpose of what you may find yourself doing or saying, there is a good chance that your ego has stepped in and is directing the process. And that is not a sin, but it is not likely to be truly helpful to yourself or to anyone else. And so sharing insights about someone's past lives could help them release a judgment they may be holding onto in the present against themselves or someone they know. Providing information from a deceased family member may allow someone to know that they are not being condemned for something they did or failed to do. Anything that facilitates the process of forgiveness--and you may have no idea yourself what that might be and in most cases would not--would reflect having offered a power to the Holy Spirit for His use. Similarly, anything that allows someone not to take this life and the world quite so seriously or to recognize shared rather than separate interests, would be serving the Holy Spirit's purpose of helping us to awaken from the dream of separation and sin."

    "text_input": "Q #590: After several months of being unsuccessful, I have surrendered my search for a job to God and have asked for peace instead. Yet I feel very attacked by the ego which constantly tells me I am not good enough to find a job and I feel afraid. I have also asked the Holy Spirit to help me see this situation differently. Is there something else I need to be doing? I understand that God needs me to overcome the fear in order for a miracle to take place. Is this true?",
    "output": "You've got it partly right, but let's see if we can help you get a little clearer about the process. You do not say what you mean by surrendering your search for a job to God, but strictly speaking, the notion of surrender is not a concept of A Course in Miracles--the word is never used anywhere in the Course for it implies a battle in which we in the end allow our own will to be subjugated to a higher authority's will. The Course, in contrast, leads us to the recognition that our separate will is an illusion and our true will is the same as God's Will (T-2.VI.6:4; W- pI.74)--we just don't believe it yet. In Course terms, a more helpful way to think about what you are describing is that you have decided to resign as your own teacher (T-12.V.8:3), which also means you are willing to dismiss the ego as your guide, accepting guidance instead from the part of your mind--the Holy Spirit-- that knows that finding a job is not the real problem. Now you may not yet believe that, and the fact that you still feel attacked by your ego about your self-worth means its dismissal is not yet complete. But this is after all a process, so that should come as no surprise. As for what else you want to do, your part is simply to continue to be aware of whenever your ego tries to step back in again and take control--for its voice can seem to drown out the Voice for peace. This means recognizing all the feelings of anxiety, apprehension, anger, and alarm, which may seem to be coming from failure to find a job, but are coming from failing to carry out the only job assignment we have in this world--forgiveness. And that means that we are taking ourselves and our attack thoughts seriously, whatever form they may take, whomever they may be directed against, including ourselves. And that's the real cause of our fear, for unconsciously we anticipate retaliation, from God, for those attack thoughts. So bringing them into conscious awareness allows us to look at them and their source--the ego--and, with the Holy Spirit's help, dismiss them back into the nothingness that is their source. And that is the miracle. Notice that it has nothing to do with getting a job. Obviously, in practical terms, we all need to have a means of support for ourselves so we can address our physical, bodily needs while we believe we are here. But the process of doing that need not be fraught with fear. The fear, again, is only ever an indication that we have turned away from the Holy Spirit and put our ego back in charge of the process. And as soon as we recognize what we have done, we can change our minds by changing our teachers once again."

What I am stuck on is: \"A good teacher must believe in the ideas he teaches; but he must meet another condition; he must believe in the students to whom he offers the ideas\" (T-4.I.1:4). To me this means that if I believe in this Course it then becomes an \"idea\" in my mind, and I teach  this idea. I interpret the second part to mean: (1) Jesus believes in us and is teaching us; and (2) at the level of the world we are all teachers and students. If I (the Son of God) am doing the teaching, would the student be anyone I meet, knew (in the past), or will know (in the future), or those I just think about? And would this mean that we have given up all judgment of these students or everything? Or do we not know when we are teaching?",
    "output": "Jesus is saying that to be a good teacher, not only must you believe in what you are teaching, you must also know that your students are capable of learning, and that in a very real sense they are ultimately the same as you. If you believe in the Course, you teach more than ideas. Teaching ideas is a good starting point, but if the content behind the ideas is not at some point conveyed through you, then you are not really teaching it. This comes through in paragraph 6, when Jesus lovingly reassures us: \"I will teach with you and live with you if you will think with me, but my goal will always be to absolve you finally from the need for a teacher\" (T-4.I.6:3). In other words, he is inviting us to become like him so that eventually there would be no difference between him and us, and he asks that we do this with each other. So as you are teaching others the ideas in the Course, you are learning that, on the only level that counts, you are not different from those you are teaching: all separation is an illusion, which makes judgment meaningless. That is the content that would eventually be expressed through your words as your practice of forgiveness progresses. You do not have to be in a formal teacher-student setting to do this. We teach all the time because we are always \"broadcasting\" in some way or other the decision we have made in our minds to identify with the ego's thought system of separation or the Holy Spirit's thought system of forgiveness, and others are always \"scanning\" for a signal that will somehow tell them that they are wrong in their self-condemnation and the projection of that on to others through judgment."

My wife was recently deployed to Iraq, and even though I can contain the fear early in the day, later I start to feel overwhelmed and powerless, often performing the Baptist rituals out of desperation. It seems as if I am trying to communicate with two very conflicting ideas of God. What is the most effective method of prayer?",
    "output": "You express an experience common to many students who were raised with strong religious beliefs. You also have a lot of company in practicing rituals and idol worship, since that is the sum and substance of life in a body once the separation is taken seriously: \"The world believes in idols. No one comes unless he worshipped them, and still attempts to seek for one that yet might offer him a gift reality does not contain\" (T-29.VIII.8:4-5). Identifying with the body necessarily entails a vast array of rituals and idol worship in the form of physical, emotional and psychological care. Though not religious in nature, they are no different from religious beliefs in that they are used as substitutes for God and to defend the ego thought system based on the belief in separation. The underlying belief in our pursuit of comfort in rituals and idols, whatever form they may take, is that something external to the mind has caused our pain, and therefore something external can bring healing. It does not matter whether it be a prayer to a made-up notion of God, a favorite food, or a day at the beach. Having sided with the ego's belief that the separation is real, we seek escape from the terrible pain of our guilt by hiding in the body and the world. Because we have made them our \"friends,\" we think they will shelter us from pain and bring us peace. We are mistaken; they won't. But we are not completely convinced, because our strong attachment to our beliefs makes it difficult for us to reverse them. That is why the Course is a gentle learning process. It is no more a sin to say a little prayer to a god that doesn't exist, than it is to relax with enjoyable music: \"You do but dream, and idols are the toys you dream you play with\" (T- 29.IX.4:4). The important thing is to be aware of the fear, that causes the stress, that results in the ritualistic behavior. It can be very helpful to see this dynamic in operation and to acknowledge to Jesus or the Holy Spirit that you are afraid, concerned for your wife's safety, and unsure of what to do to feel better. That would be an effective prayer. If then you sincerely invite him to be with you as you say your \"Baptist\" words, or do whatever you find comforting, they will not make you feel guilty. More importantly, the part of your mind that knows they are not the real answer, and are not what you truly believe, will be strengthened. You may find it helpful to read The Song of Prayer, which is one of the Course supplements. It offers a very beautiful and comprehensive view of prayer in accord with the teaching of the Course."

    "text_input": "Q #593: I have a question regarding the process of A Course in Miracles. I have episodic rhythm disturbances of my heart. Not something real serious but enough that I have a cardiologist and am taking all kinds of pills. These episodes come and go every few days but over time seem to be getting worse. Whenever I get these arrhythmias I immediately get angry and frustrated because it is happening again despite my best efforts on the level of form to prevent them. However, I have felt at times, buried beneath the anger, a secret glee that I am suffering. As soon as this thought arises I can feel myself cringe and want to look away. I continue to try just to step back with Jesus holding my hand and look at my feelings and reactions and ask for help. I know Jesus can't take away my fear of dying or suffering but I pray for Him to help me with the conditions that have led to that fear. During those moments when I am most afraid I tend to drop Jesus' hand and run back to my old ego security blankets. Do you have suggestions to help students not to run away from Love, maybe even certain sections from the Course that might be helpful? Why do I feel like a failure at times when I try to apply the Course?",
    "output": "First of all, please remember to be gentle with yourself. Failure is an ego term--it's not in the Holy Spirit's or Jesus' vocabulary. So you know how much stock you can put in that judgment! You feel like a failure only when you've accepted the ego as your teacher. And that's the only problem. And so the solution is to turn to a different Teacher. Jesus gently reminds us that we are simply unable to \"distinguish between advance and retreat. Some of your greatest advances you have judged as failures, and some of your deepest retreats you have evaluated as success\" (T- 18.V.1:5-6). Perhaps it would be helpful to realize that Jesus is not asking you to choose between him and your ego--he knows you're still too fearful to let go of the familiar supports. He only asks that when you become afraid of his love and go running to your \"old ego security blankets\" that you remember that he is still with you, smiling lovingly like an older brother who only wants to reassure you that the bogeyman you're afraid of is just in your mind and isn't real. That you have allowed yourself to recognize the secret glee that you feel in your suffering is proof that your ego is no longer in complete charge. That you are afraid to stay very long with that recognition is not surprising, for it can lead us to question the ego's purpose behind all those unfortunate and painful things that seem to happen to us, beyond our control. And as we begin to do that, our ego's days are numbered. So please don't be hard on yourself for your reluctance to stay with those thoughts. Simply trust that you will be able to, with greater ease, as you are ready. And the readiness comes from being kind to yourself and not from any effortful striving on your part."

    "text_input": "Q #594: I realize that content is more important than form, yet in this dream of form, I have to have some form in which I appear; thus since duality is meaningless--sickness/health, abundance/poverty, happiness/unhappiness, etc.--is it wrong to desire one over the other while I'm on the road to awakening? While five years ago I was at the bottom of the barrel groveling around with emotional sickness and also serious financial lack, the last thing I had time for was spiritual contemplation, but in the last three years I've found myself in a relationship where I didn't have to work, and consequently found A Course in Miracles and could spend five or six hours a day devoted to learning it. So choosing abundance and health has helped to speed me up the Atonement ladder. But now I'm wondering if I should stop consciously desiring these conditions and just focus on content of mind and not even concern myself with my body, my lifestyle, etc., and just know that as I heal my mind more and more, everything for my highest good will manifest anyway. Are we supposed to get to the point where not one thought we have is about anything concerning who we think we are in this body?",
    "output": "At the very top of the ladder, you know you are not a body, and you know the body is nothing; therefore, as nothing, the body would have no appeal to you at all. As you make your way up to that level, though, you never want to deny the physical and psychological needs you experience as real. On these intervening levels, duality is not experienced as meaningless, though intellectually you believe that it is. Therefore it is important to be honest about that, accept where you are in that respect, and not fight it. It would not be spiritually helpful to simply stop yourself from wanting your life in the world to be a certain way. That would lead you into sacrifice, which Jesus helps us realize is never loving. The concealed guilt in your mind is the problem, not your body or your lifestyle. That guilt would not go away just because you give up the desire to have a healthy body and financial security. It would not be reinforced either by your continuing to desire them, as long as you are willing to learn that they cannot give you the peace of God. You might also think of the abundance and health that came into your life as a reflection of a decision you made not to attack yourself any further. That would help you get in touch with the content in your mind and you would be less inclined then to regard health and abundance as something meaningful in themselves. As you make your way towards the top of the ladder, you would experience peace as who you are as God's creation, and that that inner state has nothing to do with external conditions. But in the meantime it's okay to still desire them. Judging yourself for desiring a healthy body and financial security is the only mistake you can make; and you can avoid that ego temptation by learning to smile at yourself and not making your Atonement path into something so serious. Gentleness and kindness towards yourself is always the best approach to take."

    "text_input": "Q #595: As I get more and more into A Course in Miracles I find so many things meaning less and less: like being popular, being noticed for some achievement, being appreciated, or just being in other people's company. I truly enjoy being by myself, studying the Course, working on healing my relationships in my mind rather than actually being with these people physically, with whom I need to work on forgiveness. Is this wrong and is it also wrong to want to be around certain people in the flesh, with whom I have more of a spiritual mind set, while at the same time knowing that I am one with everyone whether I connect with them on the physical level or not? I sometimes feel guilty, since I'm wanting to exclude certain people and situations from my physical space, and then I try to feel innocent again when I know that I'm one with everyone and everything in my mind space.",
    "output": "The key word in your question is exclude, and the key principle in solving your dilemma is the distinction between form and content. The defining characteristic of authentic love as Jesus presents it in the Course is that it is \"all-inclusive.\" This is in sharp contrast to the special love of the ego that singles out certain people or groups as deserving of our love and forgiveness, as opposed to others who are not. But Jesus is always talking about the content in our minds, our attitude. He is not talking about form: what our bodies do, our behavior. You cannot be with everyone all the time; but you can be clear within your mind whether or not you are withholding love from specific people or groups, or are judging that spiritual people are better than those who are completely focused on things of the world. If you are judging some as better than others, then you no longer believe that the Sonship is one and are furthering the ego's cause of making separation reality. You would also be caught in the trap of believing there is a hierarchy of illusions: that there is a meaningful difference between spiritually advanced people and non- spiritual people. A person on the top rungs of the ladder is just as illusory as a person on the lower rungs, because the ladder itself is illusory. From another perspective, we all have preferences and limitations. That is normal within the dream of separation. It is not wrong or unspiritual to have preferences. Preferring to spend time with certain people is no different from having food preferences, music preferences, decorating preferences, and so on. As long as these preferences do not become a big deal, that is! If you have not made your preference into a big deal, you would not feel guilty. The key factor is what is going on in your mind: whether you are judging against certain people because they do not meet your criterion of \"spiritual.\" If you are kind in your mind toward everyone, you would never experience conflict about whom you are spending time with. Other students of the Course have had similar experiences--see Questions #433 and #480. There are many comforting passages in which Jesus reassures us that he is always available to us, awaiting only our invitation (e.g., T-19.IV-A.16:3-6; T-31.VIII.7-11; M-23). We leave you with passages from Chapter 12 of the text and the epilogue from the manual for teachers: \"Remember what was said about the frightening perceptions of little children, which terrify them because they do not understand them. If they ask for enlightenment and accept it, their fears vanish. But if they hide their nightmares they will keep them. It is easy to help an uncertain child, for he recognizes that he does not understand what his perceptions mean. Yet you believe that you do understand yours. Little child, you are hiding your head under the cover of the heavy blankets you have laid upon yourself. You are hiding your nightmares in the darkness of your own false certainty, and refusing to open your eyes and look at them.\" \"Let us not save nightmares, for they are not fitting offerings for Christ, and so they are not fit gifts for you. Take off the covers and look at what you are afraid of. Only the anticipation will frighten you, for the reality of nothingness cannot be frightening. Let us not delay this, for your dream of hatred will not leave you without help, and Help is here. Learn to be quiet in the midst of turmoil, for quietness is the end of strife and this is the journey to peace. Look straight at every image that rises to delay you, for the goal is inevitable because it is eternal. The goal of love is but your right, and it belongs to you despite your dreams ...\" \"A little while and you will see me, for I am not hidden because you are hiding. I will awaken you as surely as I awakened myself, for I awoke for you. In my resurrection is your release. Our mission is to escape from crucifixion, not from redemption. Trust in my help, for I did not walk alone, and I will walk with you as our Father walked with me. Do you not know that I walked with Him in peace? And does not that mean that peace goes with us on the journey? ... You do not walk alone. God's angels hover near and all about. His Love surrounds you, and of this be sure; that I will never leave you comfortless\" (T-12.II.4-7; W-ep.6:6-8)."

    "text_input": "Q #596: I experience myself as a victim of unconscious decisions made in the mind, because I definitely do not choose bad things consciously. If I have no contact with this unconscious decision-making mind, how I can take responsibility for what happens to me in the world? If I experience myself as body in the world, not as a mind, how can I look at something in my mind with Jesus?",
    "output": "It is difficult to accept that there is another part of us that we are not aware of that is the source of what we feel and what we do in the world. Yet Freud taught that many, many years ago, and that is what Jesus explains to us in many different ways in his course. In fact, one can say that that is one of the most important aspects of A Course in Miracles as a mind-training program. The lessons in the workbook, especially in the first part, are designed to help us begin to get in touch with this part of our minds. Lesson 5, for example, says we are never upset for the reason we think (W-pI.5). That means that something other than what we are consciously aware of is going on within us. And early in the text as well, Jesus tells us that if we are not feeling peaceful, we must have \"decided wrongly\" (T-5.VII.6:7)--he is talking about a decision deep within our minds to reject truth. In his teaching, Jesus makes it clear to us that the reason this part of our minds is unconscious is that we have intentionally split it off from our awareness so that we would not have to deal with all the guilt and fear we think is there, which would surely lead to our destruction, we believe. The ego told us that we would be much better off being mind-less, and so we followed that advice and then convinced ourselves that we are just bodies, not minds. But we are really minds choosing to believe we are not minds! The purpose of the Course, therefore, is first to help us realize what has happened, and then to help us regain the power of our minds to choose, so that eventually we would correct our choice to believe the ego rather than the Holy Spirit. We would then be at peace all the time. What we need to do to achieve this goal is to regard everything in our lives as somehow reflecting the decisions we are making in our minds, for as Jesus tells us, the world \"is the witness to your state of mind, the outside picture of an inward condition\" (T-21.in.5). Our lives, then, take on a whole new meaning as we shift our focus from external circumstances to the internal state they reflect. As we view our lives this way more and more (as classrooms), we would gradually be allowing ourselves to get back in touch with our minds. We need Jesus' or the Holy Spirit's help with this, though, because of the fear we have of looking within (T-21.IV). Fortunately, the healing process is not complicated, since there are only two choices we can ever make: to continue to believe that separation is reality or to undo that belief and accept once again the truth of our oneness as God's Son. Every single thing we do or feel in the world reflects one of those choices. The second part of #157 has additional commentary on the nature of the decision-making mind."

    "text_input": "Q #597: A Course in Miracles states that \"the crucifixion did not establish the Atonement; the resurrection did.\" I understand that the Atonement is the realization that nothing happened, that there was no split and that we are still part of God and always have been part of God. It is easy to see that the resurrection showed that the body was meaningless and could be \"displayed\" any time. Also the fact that God would give his only begotten son as a sacrifice for the sins of the world is such a ridiculous statement that it staggers the mind to believe that any intelligent person, for two thousand years, could believe this of a loving God.  What I do not understand is how the resurrection established the Atonement. Did not Jesus show many people that the body was nothing with all of his miracles particularly in raising Lazarus?",
    "output": "As you point out, traditional Christianity teaches that Jesus' death on the cross atoned for our sins and reopened the gates of Heaven. God then raised him from the dead as proof that Jesus was the Son of God, and that his sacrifice bridged the gap that occurred between God and His children when Adam and Eve sinned in the garden of eden. The Gospel account tells of the resurrection of the body and establishes that fact as a fundamental belief for many Christian sects. In the Course Jesus reinterprets both the crucifixion and the resurrection. He teaches that not only is the body nothing, but death is nothing as well. If the death of the body is nothing, the crucifixion could not accomplish anything. It is, as Jesus tells us in the text, only a teaching device (T-6.I.2). The phrase you quote must be understood in terms of the principles of the Course's teaching of the Atonement, and the content, not the form, of the historical resurrection. In this light the essential message of each is \"nothing happened!\" They both teach: \"there is no death\" (W- pI.163), \"there is no sin\" (T-26.VII.10:5), \"attack has no effect\" (T-12.V.2:2). In this sense Jesus' resurrection, along with ours, is awakening to the awareness of our true Identity as God's innocent Son, which the Course teaches is the Atonement. In the statement you cite, Jesus gives us the message intended in his resurrection. It is the message of the Atonement, beautifully expressed with Easter symbols in the Holy Week section of the text: \"This week begins with palms and ends with lilies, the white and holy sign the Son of God is innocent. Let no dark sign of crucifixion intervene between the journey and its purpose; between the acceptance of the truth and its expression. This week we celebrate life, not death. And we honor the perfect purity of the Son of God, and not his sins\" (T-20.I.2:1-4). It is important to remember that Christianity teaches the resurrection of Jesus' body, while in the Course Jesus tells us it is the condition of the mind when it accepts the Atonement: \"Very simply, the resurrection is the overcoming or surmounting of death. It is a reawakening or a rebirth; a change of mind about the meaning of the world. It is the acceptance of the Holy Spirit's interpretation of the world's purpose; the acceptance of the Atonement for oneself\" (M- 28.1:1-3)."

    "text_input": "Q #598: I feel I have an addiction to masturbation and although I often talk to Jesus about it, it still seems to be a problem. What can I do?",
    "output": "It is only our ego that wants us to believe that we have a problem with what we do with our bodies. But that is never the problem. As Jesus repeatedly encourages us to do, the only question we should ask ourselves about anything is, \"What is it for? What purpose does it serve?\" (e.g., T- 4.V.6:6-11; T-17.VI.2:1-3; T-24.VII.6:1-3; W-pI.96:6). We all also have \"addictions\" to breathing and eating and drinking and it is our ego that would want to make differences among our various behaviors important. Sex is one of the more powerful symbols of guilt in the dream and very effectively keeps the mind preoccupied with the \"sins\" of the body so that the mind can remain in conflict and never look at the underlying false belief in sin in the mind--the sin of separation. Anything that seems to give pleasure, the ego tells us, is simply further proof that we have stolen what we do not really deserve from God. Why do you suppose our language commonly pairs the word pleasures with such descriptors as secret, guilty, stolen and forbidden? Now if compulsive behavior--sexual or otherwise--is interfering with your relationships or with fulfilling basic responsibilities in your life, you may want to look then at the purpose you are giving that particular behavior--to be a justification for reinforcing your underlying belief in your inadequacy and unworthiness and guilt. But again, it's not the behavior itself that is the problem but the purpose you are giving it in your mind. So that's where you always want to begin. Once you get in touch with the purpose and the cost to your peace of mind, you may find yourself motivated to make changes at the behavioral level, but not out of any sense of guilt or fear or coercion--that kind of motivation is always only ego-based. Jesus does not want to deprive us of any of our special relationships and little pleasures. Through A Course in Miracles, he teaches that he wants us to recognize that the only \"real pleasure comes from doing God's Will\" (T-1.VII.1:4), which in this world means practicing forgiveness--of ourselves and others."

    "text_input": "Q #599: I have clearly gotten the idea in reading A Course in Miracles, as well as the many answers in the Question and Answer Service, that this world we seem to experience is not real. I am now studying Lesson 166 in the workbook and it does indeed say, \"This world is not the Will of God, and so it is not real.\" The previous lesson also teaches us that what makes this world seem real is our denial of the truth, the truth being that we are already in Heaven with God now. I find these thoughts very comforting, especially when this world seems to disappoint me. But I get the feeling that if this world is not real, then there is no point in scientific investigation, is there? I find myself confused because I'm appreciative of all the scientific discoveries about nature, especially those that have improved our lives. Is A Course in Miracles discouraging us from investigating nature? I'm envisioning a future world where if everyone adopted the teachings of the Course, scientists would give up research to find cures for health problems, we'd stop space exploration, we would stop trying to save the rain forests, etc., because none of these things are real and therefore unworthy of our belief in them or our attention. As a student of A Course In Miracles, how should I think about scientific investigation of our so called natural world?",
    "output": "It would be a mistake for any of us to give up anything we're drawn to or interested in simply because the Course tells us it is not real. Yes, in the end, that is the realization we will all come to, but along the way we are asked to use the symbols of the world (W-pI.184.9:2)--and that certainly could include the symbols of scientific investigation--as important elements of our classroom. Most minds are simply not ready to hear and learn the truths of the Course at the level at which it offers its healing message and so the world's symbols become an important means for communicating the content of the Course in terms the world can hear and accept. In Jesus' own words: \"It would indeed be strange if you were asked to go beyond all symbols of the world, forgetting them forever; yet were asked to take a teaching function. You have need to use the symbols of the world a while. But be you not deceived by them as well. They do not stand for anything at all, and in your practicing it is this thought that will release you from them. They become but means by which you can communicate in ways the world can understand, but which you recognize is not the unity where true communication can be found\" (W-pI.184.9). And so the goal is not to deny the world's symbols but to give them a different purpose. The ego made the world and all its symbols in order to keep us enmeshed in the thought system of scarcity and sickness and victimization. All of our human endeavors are predicated on the assumption that our problems are out there in the world and that we need to direct our talents and efforts and resources to overcoming the challenges that those problems present to us. But Jesus is asking us to recognize that the problems we identify out in the world that seem so critical are only symbols of the one problem in our mind--the belief in separation and sin (W-pI.79). Recognizing what the real problem is and where it lies does not mean that we simply abandon all of our activity and efforts to solve problems in the world. But we can now have a different approach to those concerns, one that no longer is motivated by anger or fear or guilt or sadness. With a right-minded identification, we will no longer be invested in all the obstacles that can prevent us from uncovering solutions at the level of form. For the fact is, the seeming problems of the world-- including disease, drought, famine and pollution--are there only because our ego mind wants them to be there, so that we keep our focus on the world, feeling victimized by it, and never looking to the real problem within. So, as students of the Course, we may continue to seek after solutions in the world, using, among other things, the tools of scientific investigation--as Helen Schucman and Bill Thetford, the instruments for bringing the Course into the world, continued to do until their retirements (see Absence from Felicity by Kenneth Wapnick). But that does not mean that we believe that the world is where the real problem lies. There will be others who still believe in the reality of the world and its problems and for them, the kindest approach would be to attempt to reach them at the level at which they believe they need help. Jesus describes this process early in the text: \"The value of the Atonement does not lie in the manner in which it is expressed. In fact, if it is used truly, it will inevitably be expressed in whatever way is most helpful to the receiver. This means that a miracle, to attain its full efficacy, must be expressed in a language that the recipient can understand without fear. This does not necessarily mean that this is the highest level of communication of which he is capable. It does mean, however, that it is the highest level of communication of which he is capable now. The whole aim of the miracle is to raise the level of communication, not to lower it by increasing fear\" (T-2.IV.5). And so our words and our actions may seem to express a belief in the world, but our thoughts and our underlying attitudes will reflect a different level of understanding, which sees no separate world and no separate interests. And this awareness will be communicated effortlessly to all minds, since minds are joined in a reality that transcends all the so-called laws of the world."

    "text_input": "Q #600: I am very confused now that my wife is pregnant again after 40. Even knowing that this is not real I think it is wrong to even consider abortion. I feel responsible for this new soul coming to be part of our dream, just like my other two daughters. What is your advice to people raising children of early age? How can we educate them to help them awake like we are trying to do?",
    "output": "As is everything in the dream, parenting is a classroom filled with opportunities to see the ego's separation and specialness in operation in ourselves, so they can be given to the Holy Spirit to be transformed through forgiveness. This is the only meaning A Course in Miracles gives to every relationship, including parenting. We are asked to monitor our minds for all the thoughts of judgment in every relationship. The goal is healing our own mind of the thought of separation. We need not take responsibility for anyone else's healing or awakening. Since the Course is about changing our minds in this way, there are no guidelines for specific behavior such as abortion or parenting. What the Course does offer is a different perspective. It always distinguishes between form and content, and asks that we do the same in applying its teachings to our relationships. Though children are not fully developed persons on the level of form, they are minds with the same power to choose as any other part of the Sonship. To the extent that we are willing to learn this about ourselves, it is communicated to others; not in words, but by every application of forgiveness. It is this that furthers the healing of the separation, and is the only truly loving content a parent shares with a child, as well as with every one else: \"Every loving thought held in any part of the Sonship belongs to every part. It is shared because it is loving\" (T-5.IV.3:1-2). In parenting this takes the form of all the things parents do in caring for children. Fulfilling this role to the best of your ability, while paying attention to the thoughts in your mind, with willingness to release them to the Holy Spirit, is the way to learn and teach the message of the Course. In this way belief in the Holy Spirit's perception is strengthened, while belief in the ego's lies is weakened, thus leading us closer to the Sonship's awakening. It is important to remember that parents do need to teach children to make wise decisions in the dream for that is their role. As The Song of Prayer states: \"There are decisions to make here, and they must be made whether they be illusions or not\" (S-1.I.2:4). However remember that the choice the Course is teaching us to make is in our minds, between the ego and the Holy Spirit. And again, that choice is communicated, thereby taught, by the mere fact of our making it."

    "text_input": "Q #601: The Bible culminates in Revelation. A Course in Miracles is designed to further us along the path to our revelation in the holy instant of divine knowing of ourselves as the Christ. Is this what the Course means by revelation? And if so, is this experience possible while still embodied; is it perceived in Christ Consciousness?",
    "output": "What the Course means by revelation is not the same as the biblical teaching. The Book of Revelation in the New Testament speaks of a future event associated with the Second Coming of Jesus and the end of the world. It is based on belief in the reality of world, the body, and redemption from sin. In A Course in Miracles revelation is understood to be the experience of God's Love which is always being communicated to the Son and has never changed. Revelation can be experienced while still in the body, but it is not of the body. It is communicated from God and is therefore experienced by the mind, rather than perceived: \"It proceeds from God to you, but not from you to God\" (T-1.II.5:5). Revelation is possible because the separation is not real and we are, in truth, one with the Father. In this sense revelation is our natural condition, which we have blocked from awareness by choosing against it: \"You taught yourself the most unnatural habit of not communicating with your Creator\" (T-14.III.18:1). The Father, however, is always communicating to His Son (us): \"God created every mind by communicating His Mind to it, thus establishing it forever as a channel for the reception of His Mind and Will\" (T-4.VII.3:7). Therefore, since communication with God has never been broken, our function is not to strive for or seek revelation, \" ... but merely to seek and find all of the barriers within yourself that you have built against it [love, also revelation]. It is not necessary to seek for what is true, but it is necessary to seek for what is false\" (T-16.IV.6:1-2). As always we come back to our only task, which is forgiveness. This means being willing to recognize in all our thoughts of judgment and attack, our own fear of love's revelation. We then have the opportunity to allow the Holy Spirit's perception to replace ours; what has been blocked is then revealed. The important thing is faithfulness to the process of forgiveness as Jesus teaches in the Course. Only in this way is the thought of separation healed, fear diminished, and we become, as Jesus tells us, \"less and less willing to deny\" (T-11.VI.3:6) the experience to which he is leading us. \"The revelation that the Father and the Son are one will come in time to every mind\" (W-pI.158.2:8). As discussed in earlier questions, the term Christ Consciousness is not used in the Course. Consciousness is the condition of the separated or split mind, which perceives. Our identity as Christ is our truth which is known, not perceived, and is beyond the realm of consciousness altogether. (See T-3.IV.2; T-3.III.1:10; T-26.VII.3:6)"

What about Jesus who was not ego bound, but who walked among people relating to us while consciously aware of Himself in all with whom He related? Being aware, was He not conscious? And if so, could we term this limitless level of awareness, unbound by ego, Christ Consciousness that we can aspire to? Or am I just confused about the definitions of consciousness?",
    "output": "Since, as the Course tells us, \"Consciousness, the level of perception, was the first split introduced into the mind after the separation\" (T-3.IV.2:1), it is, as you point out, \"the domain of the ego\" (T-3.IV.2:2), and thus of the separation and the unhealed mind. When the Atonement is accepted the mind is healed, and returns to knowledge rather than consciousness. The important distinction to be made, then, is between consciousness and knowledge. Jesus, who is a symbol in the dream of the healed mind, knows he is God's innocent Son. This state of mind is accomplished when there is no awareness (consciousness) of any other identity. While the mind is split by belief in the separation and is thus unhealed, it perceives; either falsely with the ego, or correctly with the Holy Spirit. It does not know, since knowledge, as it is understood in the Course, refers only to the truth. What is true is known, not perceived: \"True perception is the basis for knowledge, but knowing is the affirmation of truth and beyond all perceptions\" (T- 3.III.1:10). The term Christ Consciousness is not used in the Course. The Course tells us \"Christ is the Son of God Who is in no way separate from His Father, Whose every thought is as loving as the Thought of His Father by which He was created\" (T-11.VIII.9:4). Christ simply is, and knows as He is known. This is not the realm of consciousness, which, as we have seen, is the result of the separation and the condition of the unhealed mind. What we are learning through the Course is to forgive ourselves for every thought of judgment that keeps us rooted in the belief in the separation. This process will allow our minds to eventually accept only the truth of who we are as God's Son, just as Jesus has. We will then join him in the real world and: \"Together we will disappear into the Presence beyond the veil, not to be lost but found; not to be seen but known\" (T-19.IV-D.19:1).

    "text_input": "Q #603: You say, \"If I choose the Holy Spirit, my lesson will be that I now have the opportunity to make a different choice about the guilt that I believe is buried in my mind, releasing it to the healing light of forgiveness rather than continuing to hold on to it and projecting it in some disguised form\" (#385). Do we have to be conscious of the particular guilt or reason behind the situation? Or do we simply look at the guilt and punishment the Course speaks of because we have denied our real Self and rejected our Father--always the same reason--and ask the Holy Spirit to look at this with us? Is that enough or do we have to wait for a specific answer about a specific situation, guided by the Holy Spirit, and then ask Him to join us? When I ask how should I look at various situations, no matter how different they are, I only bring to my memory  the same words I had read from A Course in Miracles. I never obtain a specific answer, such as \"you are punishing yourself because you've been mean or selfish (or whatever) on this or that occasion.\" In other words, I never identify reasons from the world of form. So then, when a situation comes up again, I feel I did it wrong and don't feel confident in obtaining any results or progress from what I'm doing, at either the level of mind or the level of form. Can you help me with this?",
    "output": "The underlying ontological guilt in the mind over our belief that we have separated from God, attacking and destroying Him in the process, is the only problem we ever need to address. How we get in touch with that guilt, however, depends on how our mind has disguised it through projecting it outside the mind onto our body or other bodies in the world. Usually, we begin with our reactions to specific situations or events, or our memories about them, which the ego has cleverly but deceptively set up to be perceived as the cause of our feelings, so that we don't look to the mind for the cause. This is where the Holy Spirit turns the tables on the ego. What was made in the world as a subterfuge and a smokescreen to keep the guilt in the mind hidden becomes instead a symbol of that hidden guilt and so a means for returning attention to the mind, where we can get back in touch with it. But for this reversal (T-28.II; W-pI.11.1) to work, we must be willing to accept the Holy Spirit's interpretation of events rather than our own, which means acknowledging that we are wrong in our conclusions about what has happened. Now the ontological guilt in our mind can be projected into many different forms--e.g., illness in our own body (as #385 is addressing), anger at others for hurting us in some way, or guilt over what we believe we as a body have done or failed to do. All of these serve the ego's goal of mindlessness, because they keep our focus on the world outside rather than within our own mind. But once we can accept that they are merely symbols of the underlying guilt in our mind, projected out from within, we can return to the source of the problem in the mind and, through joining with Jesus or the Holy Spirit in our right mind, release the illusory guilt that has been covering the love underneath. So, to answer your question, it is not necessary to be in touch with the specific thought or judgment behind the guilt you may be experiencing in a particular situation. The fact that you are feeling guilty (or angry or sick, etc.) is all that you need to recognize and acknowledge. But you do want to be honest with yourself that you are not somehow unconsciously refusing to look at the specific reasons for the guilt because you believe that would be too painful or difficult (see #335 for a related discussion). Jesus addresses this issue, in the context of fear, but it applies to guilt as well, in the following passage: \"It is not necessary to follow fear through all the circuitous routes by which it burrows underground and hides in darkness, to emerge in forms quite different from what it is. Yet it is necessary to examine each one as long as you would retain the principle that governs all of them. When you are willing to regard them, not as separate, but as different manifestations of the same idea, and one you do not want, they go together\" (T-15.X.5:1-3). In other words, you don't want to use what could be only an intellectual understanding of a Course principle as a way of avoiding getting in touch with what you believe to be the ugliness of your ego. But if you allow yourself to feel the unworthiness, the self-loathing, the sense of inadequacy, or some other variation of the guilt, and do not shrink back from those feelings but look at them openly and honestly, then the specific reason the ego may want to give for why you feel that way is not really important. The fact that you feel that you are repeating the same mistakes and are not really making progress at any level could reflect a number of different things. As already noted, if you are using the idea of the less specific, more abstract guilt in the mind as a way of avoiding looking at what you really believe about yourself, you may wish to be as honest with yourself as you can about your willingness to uncover the darkness--a very frightening process indeed for any ego- identified mind. But you may also be being unreasonably impatient with yourself--Jesus after all admonishes us that we are in no position to judge our progress (T-18.V.1:4-6). Simply because I find myself losing my peace in a familiar old situation right now does not mean that I was a failure earlier when I thought I was able to release my guilt in a holy instant. But my ego would want me to believe that about myself. For then there is little reason for hope and good reason to despair, an outcome the ego relishes. So you want to remember that your part is simply to uncover the darkness--identify the occasions of sin and guilt in your own mind as they are projected in various forms out onto your body and into the world--and that it is the Holy Spirit's gentle love that will release you from them if you offer them to Him. If you will do merely this, you can trust that you are climbing the right ladder that will lead you home and you need not be concerned with how many rungs there are or how many steps you will have to take."

    "text_input": "Q #604: If the ego invented the concept of afterlife, and nothing happens when the body dies, since it never lived, my question is: as long as I am not yet in the real world, hence identify with the self I think I am, what will be my experience after the \"death\" of my body?",
    "output": "When the body dies, the person you identify with as a body will no longer seem to exist. If the mind is not healed at that time, the thought of separation that identified with this body continues as a thought. Since the mind is not contained in the body, it does not change with the death of the body. It changes only when it chooses the Holy Spirit instead of the separation. It is this choice that eventually undoes the separation, and leads us to awaken from the dream of death where bodies seem to live and die. As long as the mind chooses to believe in the thought of separation, this thought, along with the guilt that inevitably accompanies it, will be projected out in some bodily form (physical, esoteric, energy, etc.). The result is the ongoing experience of the birth-death-rebirth cycle, until a different choice is made in the mind. The mind, therefore, is the place where the action is, and the only action is choosing. While we remain asleep in the dream, our only purpose or goal, whether in the body or out of the body, is to learn to make another choice. Therefore, to answer your question more directly, your experience after the death of your body will be the same as it is now: learning to choose. In A Course in Miracles, Jesus tells us we are always learning, because we are always teaching: \" ... to teach is to learn ... teaching is a constant process; it goes on every moment of the day, and continues into sleeping thoughts as well\" (M-in.1:5-6). We may thus paraphrase \"learning continues after the death of the body as well.\" The important thing Jesus is teaching us is that we are not bodies, but minds with the power to choose."

    "text_input": "Q #605: A Course in Miracles says that we project what we do not want to another person. I have a friend who is extremely intelligent, IQ was tested at Berkeley and recorded as 240. This is obviously a quality that everyone would want and not something to project. I guess the same applies to being wealthy. Everyone wants it but only a few are actually wealthy. This does not make sense.",
    "output": "When the Course says we project what we do not want, it is referring specifically to the guilt in the mind. And the ego's real but hidden purpose in projecting the guilt is to keep it, although it tells us projecting it is how to get rid of it (T-7.VIII.1-3; T-13.II.1-2). The other half of the ego's game of guilt, which it also keeps hidden from our awareness most of the time, is that we want to be victims so that it's very clear that the guilt rests outside of us. In order to have this wish fulfilled, the ego has made up a world of differences, where we all differ from each other in many different ways, including intelligence, wealth, beauty and health, to name just a few. If we were all completely the same at the level of form, there could be no victims. And so, it meets our ego's hidden objective that some of us are smarter or wealthier than others, so that those of us who have less can feel somehow unfairly endowed by God or our parents or fate. But this does not mean that those who have more may not also feel the burden of greater responsibility or awareness or expectation for their greater \"gifts.\" That is the beauty of the ego's game of differences--no one ends up being happy and everyone feels somehow deprived and victimized. It is Jesus' purpose through his Course to help us understand the ego's disguised intentions so that we can make a different choice. For it is only our decision that gives power to the ego (e.g., T-7.VIII.5). And when we truly understand that we are giving up everything in order to have a little bit of nothing, Jesus is confident that we will make a different choice."

    "text_input": "Q #606: I have been studying A Course in Miracles since l989. My lesson more and more is that differences do not matter. Obviously this is a process and not easy. My experience is that I feel a bit shut down when I \"quietly smile and do nothing.\" I still feel superior to others when I identify with what the Course teaches and hear what some others espouse. On the other hand, I also feel inferior when I speak with those who are on a different path, as they tend to sound very together and peaceful. I understand the Course would say that nothing needs to happen and I just need to look with Jesus on this. There certainly is a struggle between the right mind and the wrong mind, and I find that I am still predominantly in my wrong mind. It seems like such a long process. But at least I am aware of that. Could you speak to this experience? Am I mixing levels?",
    "output": "It does not sound as if you are mixing levels. Practicing the Course can at times feel like a very long process. But time is relative and fifteen years is not very long, when you consider all the lifetimes it took to get you this confused! And comparing your experience with that of others, whether they are on the same path or different paths, is a sure-fire ego way to catch yourself in irrelevant differences! We are simply not in a position to judge anything that is going on for ourselves or others, insulting as this fact may be to our egos. But in our right minds, that awareness can be a relief, for it releases us from the burden of responsibility for trying to understand what is happening--nothing is happening (T-18.IV.7)! Realize too that the struggle between the right and wrong minds is a one-sided one. Only the ego struggles. The Holy Spirit never struggles (T-14.VII.5:2-3), for He knows the powerlessness of the ego and that there is truly nothing to battle. That realization can help you to relax and allow the process simply to unfold. Nothing needs to be forced or moved along. Because our part in the process is so simple--which is not to say easy--we may be inclined to dismiss the power of the simple act of looking at our egos without judgment. Our ego, feverishly geared toward ceaseless activity at any cost, crusading to right wrongs and make the world--its home, not ours--a better place, is pleased when we make such an underestimation. But as the manual for teachers points out, a teacher of God can afford to be patient when he knows that the outcome is certain (M-4.VIII.1:1-4)."

    "text_input": "Q #607: In your answer to #388, you say that A Course in Miracles \"tells us that true prayer is the prayer of the heart, and it is always answered because in the dream we have and experience anything we truly desire.\" Why then, do we suffer? Your answer, I assume, is that we want to reinforce our guilt because we unconsciously believe that would save us from God's wrath. This is a very unsatisfying answer. Why don't we just always select pleasure in the world as a defense, and leave out the pain altogether?",
    "output": "The Course offers a clear and simple answer: \"It is impossible to seek for pleasure through the body [or the world] and not find pain\" (T-19.IV-B.12:1). That is because when the mind chooses to identify with the body, it simultaneously denies its true Identity, and pain is the inevitable outcome. Our prayer is thus answered by the power of the mind to choose. By choosing to believe that the body and the world are real, and then defending that belief, we do get what we desire: a body in the world that proves that our individual and special self is real. The problem is, in making this choice, we have thrown away the only thing that can truly bring us happiness: the Identity God gave us as His Son. We are then left with a painful sense of emptiness and loss that nothing in the world can fill. All seeking of \"pleasure\" in the world is actually an attempt to ease the pain of this loss. However, the pleasure we seem to find in this world does not last and does not truly meet our need. We are thus bound to seek further in an unending and exhausting cycle of attempting to heighten pleasure and minimize pain. As long as we believe there is something in this world that can truly satisfy us, we remain confused about who we are and will experience pain. We are not only confused about who we are, we are confused about what makes us happy and what causes pain. Jesus tells us in the text: \"Anything in this world that you believe is good and valuable and worth striving for can hurt you, and will do so. Not because it has the power to hurt, but just because you have denied it is but an illusion, and made it real. And it is real to you. It is not nothing\" (T-26.VI.1:1-4). This is a very important and difficult lesson for us to learn because we cling to our specialness as bodies, and fiercely defend our belief that happiness can be found in the world. While we seek endlessly to make the world real and pleasurable, Jesus tells us in the Course that it is not real and our experience here is hell. We are being taught through the Course that our choice is not between pleasurable or painful experiences in the dream; it is between awakening from the dream by identifying with the Holy Spirit, or remaining in hell with the ego. We are offered another clear and simple response: \"Reason will tell you that there is no middle ground where you can pause uncertainly, waiting to choose between the joy of Heaven and the misery of hell. Until you choose Heaven, you are in hell and misery\" (T-22.II.7:7-8). The question then is: why do we continue to choose hell? That is where your observation is correct. Having chosen to identify with the ego, we are consumed with guilt and a feeling of unworthiness. We believe we do not deserve God's Love in Heaven because of our sin. And yes, we banish ourselves to hell to punish ourselves, before God (the ego's God) gets His chance which we believe means total annihilation. Our suffering and victimization serve very effectively to prove we are right about our sinfulness. Just as the credit card ad tells us, \"we cannot leave Home without them.\" Our \"prayer\" for separation has been answered. Our hope lies in the fact that our prayer for the peace of God is just as easily answered through our choosing it. We experience this peace each time we are willing to question the value we place on the world and turn to the Holy Spirit in our minds for the prayer we share with Him: to \" ... accept yourself as God created you, [and] ...be incapable of suffering\" (T-10.V.9:5)."

    "text_input": "Q #609: I am interested in how multiple personality disorder (MPD) fits in to the concept of the ego. To my way of thinking, it would be an ego that is splintered in some way. Also, is it possible for a person to experience MPD as a result of traumas in past lifetimes?",
    "output": "The ego is the thought of splintering and dividing off. The mind of the Son when he seemed to fall asleep and dream a dream of separation was (and still is) one mind. But as part of the defense against the guilt and terror in the mind over having destroyed love and fearing retaliation for his sin, the Son's mind seemed to splinter into billions of seemingly separate little fragmentary minds, in order to hide from God. The following lines from \"The Substitute Reality\" (T-18.I) in A Course in Miracles present this idea: \"Fear is both a fragmented and fragmenting emotion ... You who believe that God is fear made but one substitution. It has taken many forms, because it was the substitution of illusion for truth; of fragmentation for wholeness. It has become so splintered and subdivided and divided again, over and over, that it is now almost impossible to perceive it once was one, and still is what it was. That one error, which brought truth to illusion, infinity to time, and life to death, was all you ever made. Your whole world rests upon it. Everything you see reflects it, and every special relationship that you have ever made is part of it\" (T-18.I:3:3; 4). And so each of us could be considered one of the personalities in the Son's multiple personality disorder that has resulted from the splintering of the initial thought of fragmentation or separation (this relationship has been discussed previously in #165). If this process can produce what seem to be separate individual minds, as we each experience ourselves, each identified with a single body (or multiple bodies across different lifetimes), there is no reason that the process of splintering could not also produce multiple personalities split off from one individual mind that seem to share the same body. The Course makes it clear that the mind is not in the body (e.g., T-27.VIII.7:1; T-28.II.2:8; W-pI.167.6:1-3)--the body is nothing more than a projection of the mind. So a fragmentary mind further fragmented into multiple personalities can project a single body with which the multiple fragments all identify. It may seem as if events in the life of the body are the catalyst for the splitting process in MPD, but those events are really only specific symbols for the fear and guilt in the mind that seemed to result from the initial insane idea of separation. And so it is not really events within one lifetime or from past lifetimes that would cause the splintering, but rather the traumatic initial attack on love which they remind the mind of, which triggered the defense of further separating or splintering within the split mind. And all the splintering happened in that single instant of attack, at which time the separation was also healed. So now all of us are only choosing to bring into mind again what is already over (W-pI.158.3,4; M-2.2:2-3). And healing, whether we speak of MPD within an individual mind or the mind of the Sonship as a whole, will be the same--a reintegration back into the one mind of the seemingly separate fragments that have believed they exist in isolation with independent existences. As part of the process, the illusory nature of the seemingly separate fragments is recognized and they are released, no longer needed as a defense against the guilt and the terror in the mind. Those diagnosed with MPD will sometimes express sadness or fear over the impending loss of some of their personalities. This reflects the same fear that we all experience that the self we identify with and call by our given name will disappear when we truly forgive. But when we have reached that point in our forgiveness process, we will no longer be identified with this false, illusory self, and we will realize we are giving up nothing (T-16.VI.11:1-4)!"

    "text_input": "Q #610: Please explain \"Ideas leave not their source.\" I'm having a hard time understanding it.",
    "output": "A Course in Miracles twice refers to this principle as one of the basic or central thoughts in its teachings (W-pI.156.1:3; W-pI.167.3:6-7), so it's good to understand it. It's a foundational thought in understanding both the Atonement principle and the process of forgiveness. In the Glossary-Index for A Course in Miracles, Kenneth Wapnick restates this principle as \"an idea cannot leave the mind that thought it.\" So at the level of Heaven, this means that we, as Ideas or Thoughts created, or thought, in God's Mind (T-6.II.8:1-2), cannot separate from Him-- the separation cannot happen. We must remain as Ideas in the Mind that thought us--we cannot leave our Source. Another way of thinking about this is that if God is All That Is and there can be nothing outside Him, then we can not be anywhere except where He has placed us, within His Mind. This is the basis for the Atonement principle, which asserts that the separation never happened (T-6.II.10:5-8; M-2.2). Now the ego, which is the illusory thought of separation, would like us to think differently, and the body and the world are what it offers as proof that we are indeed separate from our Source. And certainly our experience is that there is a world external to us that operates on each of our separate bodies, independent of our own thoughts. But the Course, drawing again on this principle and applying it to the Son's seemingly split mind, asserts otherwise. The thought of separation, and the guilt that the ego tells us must accompany it, cannot leave the ego mind that thought them. The ego's plan to escape guilt by projecting it outside the split mind is a doomed venture, for our desire to see guilt outside of ourselves constitutes an attack, both on ourselves and on what or whom we want to see as outside ourselves, which only serves to reinforce and maintain the guilt in our own mind, and not escape from it. To help us understand how something which seems so very real and separate from us can still be within our mind, Jesus uses the metaphor of the dream to describe our experience in the world (T-10.I.2,3; T-18.II). Certainly, when we are asleep at night, dreaming, we seem to be a body, and a world seems to exist separate from the self in the dream we think we are. But that is only because our mind has mistakenly identified ourselves with one specific figure in the dream, to which the rest of the dream world seems external. And yet, upon awakening, we recognize that the self we thought we were and the world in which that self moved and all the other figures in the dream were all contained within our dreaming mind--the ideas of which we were dreaming never left their source in our mind. There was nothing outside our mind, external to us, despite what our experience while we slept and dreamed seemed to be. Our waking world, Jesus tells us, is no different (T-10.I.2). Although it appears to be outside, it has never left its source--the guilt over separation within our split mind. And this is the basis for the Course's process of forgiveness. For if all the other figures in my life who seem to attack me in various ways and cause me pain are really nothing but projections of the guilt that has never left my own mind, then I am not really needing to forgive anyone but myself. And my brothers, who only seem to be outside of me, are simply giving me the opportunity to get back in touch with that buried guilt in my mind, which I have made them symbols of. Now, even with an intellectual understanding of what the Course means and how this process works, our resistance to putting it into practice is going to be tremendous. That resistance, for example, would explain why you would have found yourself having such difficulty understanding what the phrase itself, \"Ideas leave not their source,\" means. For it turns our whole world upside down and inside out, or perhaps more accurately, outside in! The gentle steps that Jesus is leading us along do not require that we accept totally what he is teaching us here, but only that we have the humility to acknowledge that perhaps our interpretations of what seems to be happening to us are mistaken, and perhaps we will be happier acting from a recognition of shared interests with all our brothers, rather than from separate, competing interests. For, in the end, we will each come to realize that not only are we and our brothers the same, but we are one. And so, to quote another Course principle that depends on this one as well, \"All that I give is given to myself\" (W-pI.126)."

    "text_input": "Q #611: When I was fifteen, I started a \"want\" list because my mother told me that she had read some wild claim that if you just wrote down what you wanted and read it a few times you would get \"it.\" I tried it and it worked on almost everything I put on paper and focused on. Over the next 30 years I added other \"ways\" of getting what I wanted to this secret my mother had told me about. I have been studying A Course in Miracles for 18 months now and I have much more clarity about the power of the mind to create and miscreate. But having studied and learned how  to use the power of my mind to attract \"things\" to me for so many years without having all the truth, I have a couple of questions. Is the ego threatened when we learn about visualization or how to \"create\" whatever we want through a variety of practices? Or as long as we are miscreating things to keep us more identified with the world, does the ego care? And can you tell me where we visualize or make pictures in our head? Is it strictly a function of the brain or is the mind involved?",
    "output": "In one of the clearest statements of the process you refer to, the Course says in workbook Lesson 325, \"All things I think I see reflect ideas\": \"This is salvation's keynote: What I see reflects a process in my mind, which starts with my idea of what I want. From there, the mind makes up an image of the thing the mind desires, judges valuable, and therefore seeks to find. These images are then projected outward, looked upon, esteemed as real and guarded as one's own\" (W-pII.325.1:1-3). Although beginning to recognize the power of the mind to choose and control its projections can be threatening to the ego, for it suggests that the world does not operate according to the \"laws\" we generally have believed and we are not simply its effect, or victim, the ego is always very clever at giving any of our experiences its own special interpretation. In particular, so long as we continue to believe that it is this individual self that we identify as ourselves, living in time and space, who is mastering these techniques, the ego has little to worry about. We think we are making \"pictures in our head\" and that our brain is somehow involved, but that is all merely part of the ego's delusion to keep us mindless, that is, unaware that our reality is truly mind and not body. But because of the ego programming that we have all very willingly accepted, we allow ourselves to be easily deceived about where such powers reside and how they are accessed, never realizing that our minds are literally miscreating the entire world, and not simply the specific parts of it that we believe we can master to meet our specific personal needs. The Course's metaphor of the dreamer is helpful in understanding this. With our sleeping dreams at night, it is not difficult to recognize, when we awaken in the morning, that it is not the figure in the dream that has any effect on the events in the dream. It is our mind as the dreamer, and it is making up the entire dream world (T-18.II.5), and not simply certain aspects of that world. And similarly, with our waking dreams, it is the split mind of the Son, of which we are all a part that is producing the entire illusory world. As you mention, so long as our purpose with such techniques is to meet our perceived needs and remain identified with this self and the world, we remain hooked on the ego's way of thinking. Only by an honest evaluation over time of whether our mind's ability to project certain forms to meet our self-identified needs is really making us happy will we come to recognize that we are not. For the underlying premise behind the use of such techniques is always the belief that we have needs, which means something is missing or lacking in us, which unconsciously reaffirms the thought of separation in our mind and the accompanying guilt (T-1.VI.1,2). Jesus' purpose in having us recognize the power of our mind to make up a world is not so that we can make up a better world. Rather, he wants us first to accept responsibility for our experiences so that we do not continue to perceive ourselves as victims of a world outside us. We will then be more willing to turn to a different part of our mind to be in control of the process-- the Holy Spirit, Who helps us learn what we really want. With the choice of a different Guide through the illusion, Who teaches us our only need is forgiveness, we will begin to take the gentle steps from sleeping and dreaming to awakening to our true reality as spirit, in which there are no needs."

These are just words to me. Is the solution to love everyone I meet, see, or think of?",
    "output": "In the Course, Jesus is always addressing the mind, and in this case the right mind, which is the part of the mind that remembers God's Love for His Son and the Son's love for His Father. This passage refers to the true relationship between the Father and the Son that remains unchanged by the ego's insane belief in the separation. It speaks of a love we have forgotten by choosing to believe we are separate from God. It is not saying that the individual who identifies with a body in the dream loves God. There is no love for God (or anyone) in this world: \"The world was made as an attack on God. It symbolizes fear. And what is fear except love's absence? Thus the world was meant to be a place where God [Love] could enter not, and where His Son could be apart from Him\" (W-pII.3.2:1-4). \"Love\" in the world is special love which is based on having our needs met by persons, objects, or events. (See: T-16.IV) The answer to your question requires distinguishing between the two levels of teaching found in the Course. Level one reflects the truth of our oneness with God in the reality of Heaven. Passages such as the one you quote are level one statements; they reflect the changeless reality outside of time and space, and refer to our true Self. However, because Jesus knows we believe the separation has actually occurred, and we believe we are individuals in bodies, he also speaks to us on the level of our experience in the dream; level two. On this level our experience may be that we are \"religious\" or \"spiritual\" and therefore \"love\" God, or, as you mention, have no thought of loving God. Neither the \"loving\" nor the \"not loving\" is the love to which Jesus refers. When the Course speaks of love it is always referring to level one; the love that belongs to the changeless reality of our true Identity as God's one Son. We are not asked to learn this love, \"for that is beyond what can be taught\" (T-in.1:6). Therefore, trying to love everyone in the dream is not the solution, because not loving them is not the problem. The problem is believing the separation and its ensuing lovelessness are real, and the solution is healing the mind of this insane thought. The way we get in touch with the part of our mind that remembers God's Love for us, and ours for Him, is to recognize our fierce defense against this love, which shows itself in all the ways we separate ourselves from one another with our judgments. Whenever we become aware of any judgment, we have the opportunity to see that we have made a choice whereby we prefer to be separate in a body rather than one with God in His Love. Guilt over making this choice is then projected out to others in the form of attack: \"If you did not feel guilty you could not attack [judge], for condemnation is the root of attack. It is the judgment of one mind by another as unworthy of love and deserving of punishment\" (T-13.in.1:1-2; italics ours). It is this thought underlying our relationships that needs to be transformed by the Holy Spirit through forgiveness. (See: Questions #59, #206, and #272.)"

    "text_input": "Q #613: I am new to A Course in Miracles, and have just begun reading/study. Is it wrong to have ambition, ideas for improvements, better ways to do things? In your job, at home etc.?",
    "output": "The Course teaches that nothing we do in the world is either right or wrong. The only \"wrong\" thing we do is making a choice in the mind to believe that the thought of separation is real. We then confirm this thought by believing that the world and the body are real. We are wrong about these beliefs. Though Jesus teaches us in A Course in Miracles that the separation never occurred (M-2.2:6-8) and the world does not exist (W-pI.132.6:2), he understands that we believe our experience in the illusory world is real. He tells us, therefore, not to deny our experience (T-2I.V.3:8-11), but to allow the Holy Spirit to use it as a classroom whereby we can learn that we have been mistaken about who we are. We do this, not by changing our behavior in the world (form), but by changing the purpose (content) of everything in our lives, from the ego's goal of separation and judgment to the Holy Spirit's goal of healing our minds of the thought of separation. If we try not to have ambition, ideas, or any of the things with which we fill our lives, we are denying ourselves the very classroom the Holy Spirit needs in which to teach us. It is precisely these experiences of being \"functioning\" bodies in the world that are the learning tools for the forgiveness process. The goal is to have them transformed by the Holy Spirit. Jesus tells us in the text: \"The ego made the world as it perceives it, but the Holy Spirit, the reinterpreter of what the ego made, sees the world as a teaching device for bringing you home\" (T-5.III.11:1). Our first task is to recognize the ego's purpose in our seemingly \"normal\" thoughts, daily activities, and most especially, our relationships. They are all designed to make our bodies and the world real, and to keep us rooted in the illusion of separation. It is very important in this process not to deny any part of our experience, and not to try to change it on the level of form. Doing so only makes it real, by convincing us that the form has real effects. No form can be the cause of any effect, because it is itself an effect, not a cause. It is the effect of a choice in the mind to believe the separation is real, as we stated earlier. This thought is what we are being taught to recognize, so it can be corrected. It is the one \"problem\" the Course speaks of (W- pI.79,80). Sensing that there is something wrong with our behavior, or with the ideas and values we hold, is very helpful. They are clues that part of the mind is aware that there is something wrong; only it is in our minds, not in the world. When we mistakenly believe that having a more comfortable financial situation, more status, better ways of doing things in the dream, will bring us true happiness, we want to remember that we are wrong, and ask the Holy Spirit to teach us what will truly make us happy. We may then pursue these ambitions, without expecting them to give or take away our peace and happiness, and most importantly, without judging ourselves as sinful for having them, since \"The Holy Spirit can use all that you give to Him for your salvation\" (T- 25.VIII.1:1)."

    "text_input": "Q #614: I have been a student of A Course in Miracles for about 10 years. Does a man compromise his masculinity if he honors, or surrenders to the spirituality of the Universe? Can a man be a man in the world with Spirituality as his guide rather than the male ego? Recently, I have come to terms with what most people think of when they think of my personality ... Mr. Nice Guy ... too nice. I have to admit that growing up in a family with a dominating mom and a father who appeased her did not bring strong masculine traits to the forefront. Now, however, I am attempting to reclaim my masculinity with the hope that this does not mean I have to abandon the spiritual progress I have made during my study of the Course. I feel a man can be a man in the world and still honor love within and express it in a masculine way!",
    "output": "To answer your question, it may be helpful first to clarify that it is not part of the Course's teaching and practice that we are to surrender to the Universe, to God, the Holy Spirit, Jesus, or anyone else. In fact, the word surrender is never used in the Course, for it implies submission of one's will to another's, as if they are different and in conflict. The Course teaches that our will and God's are one and that they are not in conflict (W-pI.74.1-4), although we have forgotten that and have made up an illusory will that seems to oppose God's Will (T-7.IV.6:1-8). The ego would want us to believe that God requires surrender, for that means the ego is both real and alive. The Course process instead is one of releasing our own interpretations and judgments to the light of true forgiveness, where their meaninglessness can simply be recognized. The Course would not have anything specific to say about whether you should attempt to reclaim your masculinity and become more assertive in your relationships with others, but there is no reason that those efforts would have to be incompatible with the Course's teachings. It certainly is possible to learn to take a position on various issues and concerns in your life and set limits without attacking others. The Course in fact could be very helpful in supporting you in doing that in a nonjudgmental, accepting way with both yourself and others. The challenge would be not to apply your developing assertiveness in a rigid, rule-bound way, for then you would simply be trading one set of self-imposed restrictions for another. Instead, you would want to be able to identify any thoughts of fear or guilt, as well as any investment you may have associated with particular actions and outcomes that concern you. If you can bring those judgments to the Holy Spirit and release them, you will then be able to act with both confidence and kindness, for your ego will not be the source of your decisions. The Course can also shed some light on why you have adopted the role of \"Mr. Nice Guy\" up until now in your life, which ultimately has nothing to do with dynamics in your family when you were growing up. It is simply one variation on what the Course calls the \"face of innocence\" (T-31.V.2), the ego's attempt to present a non-threatening, guiltless face to the world in order to keep hidden what we each really believe about ourselves--that we are the guilty murderer who destroyed love. Now that guilty secret is not really true either, but it is what we believe about ourselves, covered over by all our defenses. Until we can look directly at the self-accusation with the nonjudgmental, loving presence of Jesus or the Holy Spirit beside us and release it, it will operate at an unconscious level to sabotage all of our relationships, no matter how good and honest our intentions may seem to be. But as your mind is healed, you will find \"the strength of gentleness\" (M-4.IV.2) will be increasingly accessible to you in all your interactions with others."

    "text_input": "Q #615: About three weeks ago I had a very unusual meditation. My heart started to race and beat very heavy. I was very scared. \"I trust in you Holy Spirit, whatever is happening is okay,\" I prayed. I kept going and my body felt like it was expanding and contracting. Also, I became aware of my body as a fluid, not solid. This has happened four or five times since then. I feel very scared when it happens, but I think it is part of the process. Is this kind of thing normal?",
    "output": "Everything that our bodies seem to experience is a symbol of a thought in the mind, where the experience is actually occurring. And, as with all things that seem to happen to our bodies and in the world, what you are experiencing is neutral (T-26.VIII.3:7; T-28.II.10:6; W-pII.294) but your perception of it depends on which teacher you have chosen to interpret it for you. Because you have a split mind, it is possible, even likely, that you will vacillate between the two interpretations, shifting from fear to acceptance and back to fear again. The ego's interpretation begins from the premise that you are your body and anything that challenges its solidity and defined boundaries is to be feared, for it threatens you and the separate, individual self you believe you are (T-26.I.2-3). The Holy Spirit, on the other hand, begins from the premise that your reality is mind, not body, that the separation is an illusion and the body is not real, and anything that supports and reinforces that recognition is helpful (T-6.V- A.2-3). Quantum physics asserts that matter is not solid and that what we perceive as solid is nearly all empty space, but this kind of recognition, despite its widespread dissemination in our culture, is certainly not something that has been incorporated into our everyday consciousness yet. The symbols that each of us experience in our lives are highly individualized, as is our learning curriculum (M-29.2:6). So whether, as you compare your meditation experiences with others, you find some who share specific experiences similar to yours is not really relevant. It is at the level of content that the experience can be universal, as all of us, in our own individual ways, are returning to the realization that perception lies and that the world and our seeming selves are not what they appear to be. So whether you continue to have your specific fluid meditation episodes is not so important as that you are willing to use them to learn that we truly have no solid grounds for making our judgments in the world (T-23.II.13:4-13) and only the gentle, accepting perspective of the Holy Spirit's forgiveness makes any sense at all. For some other Questions that address some of the various experiences encountered in meditation, you may wish to refer to #181 and #307."

Once you discern how Jesus uses language in the Course and are able to distinguish between metaphorical meanings and literal meanings, the consistency of his content will become clear.

    "text_input": "Q #617: Three different questions from the same questioner:  : Can you explain the following sentence (W-pI.13.1:4) \"However, it does not follow that you will not think you perceive something that has no meaning.\" There are 3 negatives in this sentence which I do not understand.",
    "output": "The sentence means: you do perceive things that have no meaning. In the early lessons of the workbook Jesus is teaching us to distinguish between what has meaning (what exists) and what is meaningless (what does not exist). By choosing to believe the separation is real, we dream a dream in which we perceive the world and the body as real, and give them all the meaning that they have for us (W-pI.2). Nothing outside of Heaven has meaning because it does not truly exist. Since we cannot obliterate the part of the mind that remembers this, the choice against this memory causes intense conflict in the mind, which is experienced as fear and anxiety, as this lesson explains. The choice to give meaning to the meaningless puts us in competition with God as paragraph three describes. Fear that the meaning we ascribe to all things, including (and especially) ourselves, will be challenged, causes us to expend tremendous energy defending ourselves and our beliefs. This is the effect of our choosing to believe the world is real, thus perceiving things that have no meaning/existence. : Regarding #377 concerning special relationships, what does it mean when you say \"the relationship will fall away?\" A: In any relationship with people, objects, or events, healing occurs when the mind chooses to identify with the Holy Spirit's Love instead of the ego's thought of separation. Guilt and its projection are thus diminished, thereby transforming the relationship from serving the ego's purpose of separation to the Holy Spirit's purpose of healing. What then \"will fall away\" is the specialness. The relationship is initially marked by specialness needs due to the sense of lack that accompanies the choice to deny our true Identity by listening to the ego. This is true for all relationships. Through the healing process of forgiveness, relationships with persons become a classroom for learning that we have no separate interests. Relationships with other things \"fall away\" in the sense that they cease to be important. They are no longer sought after to fill the void left by the separation; having or experiencing them has neither a positive nor negative effect. : In \"Right Teaching and Right Learning\" I would like clarification on the following: \"a good teacher. must meet another condition; he must believe in the students to whom he offers the ideas.\" On one level, I understand Jesus is telling us he believes in us. How does this relate to someone teaching the Course? Does it refer to a non-judgmental attitude? A: The Course tells us that in all our relationships we are both teaching and learning/teacher and student. The passage you quote is not referring exclusively to a teacher actually teaching the Course to students. It applies to each encounter we have with others. One of the most important goals of the Course is to teach us that we are minds with the power to choose, and are therefore responsible for our choice. This is the lesson we are asked to learn for ourselves and apply to everyone, whether or not they are students of the Course. It is the foundation of the forgiveness process, whereby we recognize that every experience in the dream, as well as every judgment concerning others, is the result of a choice in the mind to listen either to the voice of the ego, or the Voice of the Holy Spirit. The ego tells us we are bodies, and are guilty sinners deserving of punishment for believing this. The Holy Spirit tells us we are God's innocent Son. What we choose determines what we believe about ourselves and others. We then teach it by the mere fact of believing it: \"Remember always that what you believe you will teach. Believe with me, and we will become equal as teachers\" (T-6.I.6:10-11). When we perceive others as anything less than wholly deserving of God's Love and ours, it is because we have believed the ego's lie about our identity, judged ourselves as sinful, and believe the same about everyone else. We believe in students (others) by recognizing that they are not victims imprisoned in bodies; they are minds with the power to choose, just as we are."

    "text_input": "Q #618: My sister was diagnosed with cancer about a year ago and was given six months to live. At that point my husband and I joined in helping her with alternative therapy. She could not work so she has become financially dependent on us for help. She has obviously had some success but continues to look for negative signs of health conditions. We feel she could do more for herself in that she continues to smoke, not exercise, and depends on magic too much. Her dependency on us keeps growing and we feel she is losing sight of her own power. How can she become independent of us while we are still helping her? Can we have expectations of her?",
    "output": "In A Course in Miracles, Jesus tells us, \"It is not up to you to change your brother, but merely to accept him as he is\" (T-9.III.6:4). And his words apply equally to sisters! Now, before you decide you don't want to read any further, know that these words are not speaking about what you should or should not do with your sister, but only about your attitude toward her. The point is, and the section on \"The Correction of Error\" from which the above line is taken clarifies this, we can do nothing but reinforce our own ego and the egos of those with whom we are in relationship if we make our decisions on our own. For in situations such as you are experiencing with your sister, we will inevitably feel put upon, taken advantage of, and used. And those simply are not right-minded feelings. Any action we take based on them will not be loving to anyone. It may very well be that the most helpful thing for your sister is for her to become more independent of you. But so long as you have a personal investment in her becoming independent, anything you do will be an attack, not only on her but on yourselves as well. And it could also be that the most helpful thing would be for her to remain dependent on you. You are in no position to judge what will be most helpful for her, because you do not know what is most helpful for yourselves. These may seem like strong words, but that is Jesus' point when he asks each of us to consider, in the very earliest workbook lessons, that \"I do not understand anything I see\" (W- pI.3)--notice he doesn't simply say we don't understand a lot of what we see!--or \"I am never upset for the reason I think\" (W-pI.5), and \"I do not perceive my own best interests\" (W-pI.24). He means all of these statements quite literally, although our egos have their rationalizations and justifications for what would simply have to be unreasonable extensions of these principles! Now you may simply find yourselves unwilling to tolerate your sister's apparent manipulations any further and you may feel compelled to establish some limits or set up some conditions with her for your continued support. Although such feelings and actions may not be without your own ego investment, it is still possible at least to acknowledge how far along the path you are willing to go with Jesus at this point, and where you feel you need to take over in the decision-making process. For if, on the other hand, you proceed to \"tolerate\" your sister, seemingly against your will, and end up feeling self-sacrificing and resentful towards her, that also is not loving to any of you. The key would be to be aware of whatever guilt you may feel in the situation, which could be projected as anger toward your sister, and bring that to Jesus to release before proceeding. Identified with our egos, we are always concerned about what others are doing and what we should or should not do about it. And Jesus is not asking us to release our egos but for an instant. For in that moment we can find the clarity we are looking for, which has nothing to do with what we do and everything to do with how we see--ourselves and others. Remember, he only ever asks of us a \"little willingness\" and he promises the rest will be provided (T-18.IV; V.2)."

    "text_input": "Q #619: I have been diagnosed with a rare form of cancer. And I know A Course in Miracles would say that this is a perfect way for the ego to get you. There is no cure as of yet. But I am doing other things to help in my healing, alternative things, praying for my highest good, asking what the lesson is I am supposed to learn in all this. Does it all go back to guilt? I ask Jesus and the Holy Spirit to help me see this differently. My father died four months after I was diagnosed. My brother gives me no emotional support. I have prayed for a healing between my brother and myself, and it only seems to get worse. Sometimes I just can't take it anymore. I have been sober for 16 years. Have I not learned anything? I feel so alone sometimes. But the cancer has taught me compassion that I already thought I had. I want to be a channel for God's Love. I have my skin-care license. That's what I love, and wanted to use that as my way of giving back. How can I be a channel if I am sick?",
    "output": "Compassion is the key word in what you have said. But you must apply it to yourself, which means being more gentle: specifically, lightening up on the judgmental thoughts against yourself, such as \"Have I not learned anything?\" I am sure you would never say that to another person with a serious problem. Why be so hard on yourself? Our perception is too limited to know why this condition is in your script, but it need not be looked upon as totally negative. The lesson you can learn is that the only important aspect of it now is which teacher you will choose to help you through it: the ego or Jesus. The ego would \"guide\" you in such a way that you would wind up feeling alone and guilty for somehow failing this Course. Jesus would help you see this differently by guiding you to the peace deep within you that is untouched by anything of the body or the world. Surely, a difficult lesson, but Jesus and the Holy Spirit would help you approach your condition as a classroom in which you can begin to recover a sense of your true Identity outside the dream of separation. This does not entail denial of your physical and emotional pain. And it does not mean that you should not pursue whatever treatment you want to, including psychological counseling for your intense feelings. There are truly kind counselors available for people who, like yourself, are undergoing a life-threatening illness. The kind, gentle approach of the Course combines both levels: doing whatever is helpful to alleviate the physical/emotional condition, and doing the inner work of bringing all your anger and grievances to the loving presence in your right mind, where you will feel that you are not being judged, but only loved. Your interaction with doctors and other medical people would then be an opportunity to choose against the ego's goal of separate, conflicting interests, and for the Holy Spirit's goal of shared interests. Our guilt prevents us from experiencing that love, so that is the importance of being open and honest about unforgiveness toward yourself and others. Learning how to look with Jesus--which means non- judgmentally--at the contents of our wrong mind puts us on the right path to healing and peace. Finally, resuming skin-care work could very well be an expression of kindness toward yourself, since that is what you love to do. But rather than doing it \"as a way of giving back,\" which sounds a little sacrificial, you might consider approaching it as a wonderful classroom--a means of joining with others through sharing a common interest. That would help you gradually to go to a deeper level of joining, where you recognize more and more that you and your clients are joined both as the separated Son of God journeying back to your true home in Heaven as God's eternally innocent Son. Your work then, combined with your \"little willingness,\" would be the means the Holy Spirit could use to heal your mind of all thoughts of separation. So it is a matter of doing whatever you can for your body, and at the same time in some part of your mind knowing that the cancer in your body is not really the problem. Your belief that you are separate from the Love and peace of God is the problem."

To make your decision based on fear, though, would seem to be counter- productive, as it would be hard to feel love for a God Who binds you to Himself and His Word out of fear. Fear and love cannot coexist. And there would also continue to be conflict if part of you still believed the Course to be a valid spiritual path. Some people have said to themselves as they continued with the Course still with lingering doubts and fear that they could be making the wrong decision: What is the worst that can happen?

We got married last July and haven't been able to spend more than a month total together since, because I just spent a few months in Korea. I returned in November, we were stationed far away from each other during the time before she got sent to Iraq in January, a day before her birthday. I tried really hard to get sent there to be with her, but it's just not going to happen. I did receive word, however, that I'm going to Afghanistan in a couple months ... it's a lot more dangerous there and my safety isn't guaranteed. My father, who introduced me to A Course in Miracles, tells me to just smile because everything is as it should be. I am so frustrated and angry at the current situation and I'm not really sure whom I'm supposed to forgive. My wife and I are both students of the teachings of Jesus, but can't really seem to figure out why our love is constantly being tested. It's been a long time now since we have seen each other, and this is a constant burden on the both of us. It has been a constant battle with the military since we got married. Why do I feel like we are being attacked? What is your advice for us?",
    "output": "Although the Course reminds us that there is no hierarchy among illusions (T-26.VII.6:5), that does not mean that we will not experience some of the times and circumstances of our lives as much more difficult, frustrating and painful than others. Your father meant well, but his advice is not strictly in line with the Course's teachings. Only through forgiveness can we be certain that we are where we are supposed to be--in our right mind--learning the lessons of forgiveness that we have, on a level we are rarely in touch with, given to ourselves. And we can't force a smile on ourselves over situations where we still feel unfairly treated and victimized. So being honest with yourselves, as you are doing, about how you are feeling--not denying what feels like the injustice of it all--is an important first step. But of course you don't want to stop there. The answer to your question that you're not sure whom you are supposed to forgive in fact holds the key. For the Course is telling us that we really only ever need to forgive ourselves. We need to forgive ourselves for believing that we can be bereft of love. And our lives, sometimes in subtle and other times in more blatant ways, are set up, by our unconscious choice, to prove to us that we will never have the love we need and deserve. Your repeated forced separations from each other certainly must reinforce that belief that all of us who find ourselves here in the world share. Many times, we are in situations where we are simply not in control of what happens to us. The army would be a prime example. But the one choice we always have, no matter the external circumstances, is which teacher we will choose to be our guide in interpreting what happens to us. If we choose the ego, we will believe that we are the victim of other people's choices, which are robbing us of our happiness. If we choose Jesus as our teacher, we will be expressing a willingness to learn that the love and peace we want is always available to us within our own minds, regardless of external circumstances. This is not an easy lesson to learn, and our lives have been set up to prove just the opposite, but the willingness to consider that possibility opens the door at least a crack to a different experience. It is only natural to want to be together, but because you are not together physically does not mean that you're not still together in the thoughts in your mind. And the Course tells us the mind is where the only genuine experience of joining can be found (T-18.VI.11-14). In those moments when you can allow yourself this different experience that transcends time and space and the body, you will know that you can never be deprived of what you truly want, regardless of where you find yourself. And over time, with practice, this awareness can grow in your experience until you will want nothing else (W- pII.231.1)."

My partner would like the \"freedom\" to have sexual affairs with other women because he says it is 'his nature' to be able to do that and not feel guilty about it. He is not willing to relinquish that freedom, and he told me so that he will not feel guilty when it happens. I love him and we share an incredible relationship in which we both have agreed to build a future together to help other people and ourselves grow. But I can't help but feel nauseous and wonder why he would want to do this. Is this a fantasy that he can't relinquish or am I wrong in not wanting him to explore \"his nature,\" for I don't have the same desire to seek out other men for sex or companionship? I am so confused on what the Course would have me do or think and can't help but ask myself, am I wrong to want a partner who would want the same things as me. I love him dearly but I am afraid this will end us and if so--so be it--but I need to know first if there is another way?",
    "output": "Rather than focusing on your partner and his expectations for the relationship and how those may conflict with your own, the Course would invite you first to get in touch with your own ego purpose for the relationship. We of course consciously seek out special love relationships in order to have our needs met and so have implicit and explicit expectations for how we would like the other person to be so that we can get what we want. And both partners have their own set of expectations based on their own needs as they perceive them. We see our own happiness and satisfaction in the relationship as dependent on whether or not the other fulfills our expectations. This is why everyone in the world seems to enter into relationships. However, the deeper, usually unconscious purpose the ego has for all special love relationships is to prove that love cannot be trusted and that we will in the end be betrayed, abandoned, or in some other way victimized by our special love partner. And the love will then turn into hate-- demonstrating from the Course's perspective that it wasn't ever really love (T-16.IV.4:1-4) but dependency. And yet such feelings, regardless of how justified they seem to be, have nothing to do with the other's behavior but only with our own deep-rooted sense of guilt and unworthiness and our overwhelming desire to project responsibility for those feelings outside ourselves on to someone else. This is the real ego purpose behind all of our relationships. Now there is nothing wrong with each of you being clear about what you want in the relationship and then looking to see if there is a match. The only mistake would be in believing that what either of you wants and would insist on having has anything to do with anything spiritual. As egos, we all want what we feel is best for ourselves and we do not really care about anyone else. So conflict is inherent and inevitable in all special relationships, and it's just a matter of time before the conflict surfaces. Justifications for or against faithfulness at the level of behavior are all ego-based (see #417 for a further discussion of the issue of fidelity). So should you stay or leave? Jesus would like you to recognize that that is not really the question. The question he would have you ask is are you willing to give the relationship a different purpose, and that would be the other way you are asking about. The different purpose would be to use the relationship as a mirror rather than as a screen, that is, as a reflection of what is buried within your own mind but projected outside rather than as a way to see the selfishness and guilt in someone else and not in yourself. And this you can do whether you remain in the relationship or not. For we are all accusing ourselves down deep of having been unfaithful to God and of looking for love and satisfaction outside of that one Relationship. And the guilt we feel over the self-accusation is enough to make anyone feel nauseous! So be gentle with both yourself and your partner in this process of self-examination, which has been facilitated by acknowledging the conflicting aims for the relationship that you are experiencing with him. Any attempts to change another in order to find our own happiness are doomed from the start (W-pI.71.2-3). But every attempt to change our mind about how and with whom we are perceiving a challenging situation, if we are willing to release our own investment in any specific outcome, is assured of success."

    "text_input": "Q #623: I have just begun reading A Course in Miracles and I'm finally getting answers I've long been searching for. However one thing continues to plague me. I was raised Catholic and became a born-again Christian at age sixteen and began speaking in tongues. I've done so ever since. The Bible says when you come together let two or three pray in tongues at most unless there is an interpreter. I've had someone in the Course explain to me the concepts of content and form. From this I've concluded that the content is the Holy Spirit and the form is tongues, so that must mean (since traditional prayer has no real purpose) that tongues are merely the product of the awareness of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. When I'm speaking this language, I'm being edified or enlightened to awareness of my natural spiritual, eternal self. Then if there is an interpretation, the church has become spiritually aware (so to speak). Is this even remotely correct? Also recently, I prophesied over a dozen people whom I had never met, telling them things I could not know about them. The Bible also speaks of this as a gift or manifestation of the indwelling spirit. Again I know what the Bible says about what prophesying is and its applications, but I don't entirely trust this information. I'm hoping that someone could clarify based on the principles of the Course, so I can maximize my use of these wonderful gifts.",
    "output": "Sorry, but the Course does not offer any specific interpretation for such abilities or gifts as speaking in tongues and prophesying. Comments and recommendations about them in the New Testament, such as Paul provides in his first letter to the Corinthians, come in the context of a completely different spiritual teaching, which sees both sin and the body as very real, and to try to integrate them with the Course's teachings will most likely lead only to greater confusion with both sets of teachings. This is because the Course offers no explanation for what specifically the body does, no matter how common or unusual, or what the body may seem to do or say in relationship to other bodies, since one of the Course's basic premises is that the world of bodies is illusory. The Course is concerned only with purpose and not with behavior--the distinction between content and form you mention. There is nothing inherently spiritual, and nothing that in itself would represent the Holy Spirit's influence or indwelling, from the Course's perspective, in speaking in tongues or prophesying. What would determine whether such activities at any particular time are spiritual or not is how they are used in that moment, which means they are no different from any other activity we might engage in. And the only two purposes they can serve are the ego's or the Holy Spirit's. In other words, speaking in tongues or prophesying would serve an ego purpose if, for example, the speaker sees them as special gifts from God that make him or her different from others, blessed by the Holy Spirit in a special way. And they could serve the Holy Spirit's purpose of forgiveness if they are used to remind everyone that we are all equally blessed and loved children of God. You may find a couple of questions that address the Course's perspective on psychic abilities of help as you attempt to reconcile your own understandings and experiences with the Course's teachings: #497 on prophecies and #589 on psychic abilities."

    "text_input": "Q #625: Could you please define or describe for me in detail what it is that you mean when you use the word God. My purpose for asking this question is that for many people the word God means many different things. When you see the symbol God you sometimes think of a man with white hair or an energy source, or your higher self. At this point, I am very familiar with the illusion I have been creating. Considering the fact that many of us are so very bored here in this illusion, I would say we have pretty much mastered the state of fear. It's everywhere. I thought perhaps if I might get an idea of God and focus my attention on that, I would begin to live in that world.",
    "output": "Although words are used to identify God as our Creator, Source, and Father, A Course in Miracles does not define or describe God. One of the important things it teaches us about God is that we cannot use words or ideas to describe Him: \" ... words are symbols, and nothing that is true need be explained\" (T-7.I.6:4). Furthermore, words and ideas are of the body, which belongs to the world that \"was made as an attack on God, ...[and] to be a place where God could enter not, and where His Son could be apart from Him\" (W-pII.3.2:1,4). None of the images, ideas or words we associate with God has any real meaning. It is not ideas about God, but the experience of His Love that will lead us home. The best we can do to explain the unexplainable, is to quote the following passage: \"Truth [God] can only be experienced. It [God] cannot be described and it [God] cannot be explained. I [Jesus] can make you aware of the conditions of truth, but the experience is of God. Together we can meet its conditions, but truth [the memory of God, and our Identity as His Son] will dawn upon you of itself (T-8.VI.9:8-11). Although God cannot be explained and love cannot be taught (T-in.1:6) the good news is that we do not have to understand God, and love extends naturally when fear has been removed. As the above passage indicates, our goal is but to join with Jesus (who represents the part of our minds that remembers God) to meet the conditions of truth. The truth is that we are not the bodies we have identified with, but are minds with the power to choose. The choice we make is between accepting that we are as God created us (T-23.I.7), or rejecting the truth, thus identifying with the ego (the thought of separation) and the body. Since clearly we have made a choice to identify with the body, we must begin our \"journey\" where we think we are, and retrace our steps back to our minds to make a different choice. We do that by becoming aware of the blocks that we have put in place to keep God away; i.e., all the judgments that keep us separate from others. Once we have taken responsibility for these judgments, we have the opportunity to allow the Holy Spirit to transform them through forgiveness, which is \" ... but a willingness that truth be true\" (T- 26.VII.10:3). This willingness to let our mistaken beliefs be transformed is all that is required. That is what we need to focus on if we truly want the memory of God's Love to replace fear."

    "text_input": "Q #626: In the manual for teachers of A Course in Miracles we are told, \"the name of Jesus Christ as such is but a symbol\" (M-23.4:1). Why isn't it revealed earlier in the text that Jesus is purely symbolic in the curriculum? The Course truly takes on a different meaning when one realizes that Jesus' role in the Course is purely symbolic.",
    "output": "The simple answer to your question is that the statement indicates the name is a symbol, reflecting the earlier statement in the manual that \"words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality\" (M-21.1:9-10). The statement can also be understood on a deeper level, where Jesus is seen as a symbol of love, just as we are symbols of the ego's thought system of separation. On that level, everything is a symbol, since everything is taking place in a mind that believes it exists outside the perfect Oneness of God, the only reality, for which there is no symbol and which is \"ultimately known without a form, unpictured and unseen\" (T- 27.III.5:2). There are not real, separate entities existing in a physical cosmos, even though that is what our senses tell us. Lesson 184 begins by saying, \"You live by symbols. You have made up names for everything you see. Each one becomes a separate entity, identified by its own name. By this you carve it out of unity\" (W-pI.184.1:1-4). Jesus is addressing the decision-making mind outside time and space, as he always does in the Course. Yet, in that same lesson he makes it clear that he is not expecting us to go beyond all symbols; but he also cautions us not to be deceived by the symbols of the world: \"They do not stand for anything at all, and in your practicing it is this thought that will release you from them. They become but means by which you can communicate in ways the world can understand, but which you recognize is not the unity where true communication can be found\" (W-pI.184.9:4-5). \"Jesus,\" then, is a symbol, not of the world of separation, but of the real world of love and unity. As we identify more and more with the mind and less and less with the body, we will be better able to relate to this. In the meantime, we should go right on relating to him and ourselves as individuals as long as that is our experience, keeping in mind, however, what he is teaching in this lesson in particular. He is teaching us how to use the names of things in the world to get beyond them to the \"one Name, one meaning, and a single Source which unifies all things within Itself\" (11:3). Our starting point, which will take us a long way, is to ask help of Jesus or the Holy Spirit to see beyond the separate, competing interests that divide us to the common purpose we all share of restoring to our awareness our unity as God's one Son. This process of forgiveness is wonderfully described in the section in the text called \"Beyond All Symbols\" (T- 27.III). Also, Chapter 17 in Kenneth's book, Absence from Felicity, explains Helen Schuman's experience of Jesus on these two levels. It helps to resolve the confusion that practically all students run into when they begin to deal with this aspect of the Course."

    "output": "Aside from the specifications in the Introduction to the workbook, there are no instructions for studying A Course in Miracles. It is not necessary to reread the text to begin practicing the workbook lessons, although it usually takes more than one reading to understand the fundamental principles of the thought system the Course teaches. The only requirement for the workbook is clearly stated in the Introduction: \"Remember only this; you need not believe the ideas, you need not accept them, and you need not even welcome them. Some of them you may actively resist. None of this will matter, or decrease their efficacy. But do not allow yourself to make exceptions in applying the ideas the workbook contains, and whatever your reactions to the ideas may be, use them. Nothing more than that is required\" (W-in.9). It is important to focus on the content, rather than the form. What matters is making a sincere effort to follow the instructions as carefully as you can, without judging yourself when you fail. Since Jesus knows our resistance to the Course's message is quite strong, he leads us gently. What he tells us in the text aptly applies to our workbook practice: \"And if you find resistance strong and dedication weak, you are not ready. Do not fight yourself\" (T-30.I.1:6-7). We are asked for a little willingness, nothing more."

    "text_input": "Q #628: I feel kind of confused about prayer. I have understood that forgiveness means to see something that you desire to change as being something that has been made by the ego. You accept and recognize this as true. Then you ask the Holy Spirit for true perception regarding this thing. I understand that prayers of supplication are not answered by the Holy Spirit. Is not the very asking for true perception a type of prayer of supplication?",
    "output": "A Course in Miracles teaches that forgiveness is a process, whereby we recognize that any grievance we have against any person, event, or thing is the result of a projection of guilt. Guilt originates in the mind when a choice is made to be separate from God and from others. The mind seeks to free itself from this guilt by projecting it onto something external to itself. It then dissociates itself from responsibility for choosing separation, denies the guilt, and blames something or someone for causing its discomfort. The forgiveness process begins with the willingness to look at our grievances in the light of this teaching. Whenever we find ourselves blaming something or someone for our feelings of anger, victimization, abandonment, etc., we are asked to remember that the source of our feeling is the guilt in our minds for choosing separation, not the situation or person we are accusing. That is what the Course means when it tells us we \"...forgive the Son of God [our brother] for what he did not do\" (T-17.III.1:5). Because we have denied our identity as minds and have a strong attachment to our identity as bodies, this is not an easy process to practice. That is where \"prayer\" comes in. The Course does not tell us that the Holy Spirit does not answer prayers of supplication. All prayer begins with supplication. Because we perceive Jesus and the Holy Spirit as separate from us, our experience is that we ask them to help us. They represent the part of our minds that remembers our true Identity as God's innocent Son. The prayer is actually a way of reminding ourselves that we do have a mind with the power to choose \"another way\" of looking at any situation. The very fact of recognizing misperception as a mistaken choice is already another way of looking, and is in itself the answer to a prayer to see differently. It is not the whole story, but it is a good beginning. Once we have come this far in the process, we have the opportunity to accept that the Holy Spirit's perception is true, and we would be happier if we let it replace all the judgments about ourselves and others that we have used to keep ourselves rooted in the illusion of separation. This, too, is a prayer, in that it expresses our desire to remember this process each time we find ourselves judging, and becoming upset with the people and circumstances of our lives. Our prayer then, is to remember, and the answer is our remembering. This is how we join with the Holy Spirit in our minds, and allow Him to teach us to eventually remain there with Him. It is the prayer described in The Song of Prayer (supplement to A Course in Miracles), whereby we \"Ask ... to receive what is already given; to accept what is already there\" (S.1.I.1:7)."

I can't see anything in the world to be happy about although others perceive me as happy, kind, loving, etc.--a perception I do not share. I'm sure that if and when I ever learn what A Course in Miracles is teaching I will know what happiness is. But I need to see something that reflects love in the meantime. Help!",
    "output": "Within the illusory world of separation from God, the mind of God's Son is divided between the part that expresses the ego thought system (the \"wrong mind\") and the part that expresses the Holy Spirit's thought system (the \"right mind\"). This split mind is completed by a decision- making aspect that is always choosing between the two. What emanates from the right mind is truly loving in contrast to what emanates from the wrong mind, which has the appearance of love but is always some form of special love and therefore not really loving at all. The world reflects one or the other to us, since the world \"is the witness to your state of mind, the outside picture of an inward condition\" (T-21.in.1:5). The concept of cause and effect, specifically the idea that the inner is the cause of the outer is a major aspect of the mind-training dimension of this Course. Since that is the exact opposite of what the world teaches, it is a most difficult concept for us to grasp, let alone practice. The core message of the Course will be misunderstood if this aspect of its theory is passed by. That is why Jesus places such great emphasis on it throughout his course, but especially in the early part of the workbook, where he says again and again that our inner and outer worlds are the same (e.g., W-pI.32.2:1) When you look out from your right mind, you are looking with Jesus--what is known in the Course as vision, or true perception. With Jesus as your \"eyes,\" you would see only what is loving or what is calling for love, both in yourself and others. The process Jesus guides us through in his course is this kind of gradual, gentle transition-- from depending on what our physical senses perceive to tell us who we are and what the world is to turning more and more to him as our inner teacher to help us perceive truly."

    "text_input": "Q #630: I remember hearing Ken Wapnick, on a workshop recording, say that as the wrong mind splits the right mind also splits. Would you review these right-minded splits?",
    "output": "The right-minded splits are not splits per se but are simply the Holy Spirit's corrections for the deceptions of the ego's wrong-minded splits. Since we find ourselves self-identified as bodies in the world, at the end of the series of splits the ego has led us along to take us as far away as it possibly can from the truth of Who we are as spirit, the right-minded answer is simply the undoing of those splits, in reverse order. Briefly, the ego's first split is what seems to cast us out of the oneness of Heaven, beginning the dream of separation which seems to establish us as a separate mind that has consciousness and independence from its Source. At this point, our illusory independent existence is very vulnerable, very fragile, since it takes very little to remember our reality as God's only Son, perfectly joined with Him and perfectly at peace, which is what the Holy Spirit in our mind represents. And so to protect our individuality, the second split involves our choice to identify completely with the ego and split the Holy Spirit off from our awareness, thereby forgetting that the ego is a choice we have made and not our reality. The third ego split encompasses the ego's ingenious myth of sin, guilt and fear, in which we view the separation not only as real, but as a sinful attack on God, destroying Him as a consequence of having disrupted the perfect unity of Heaven in which God has His Being. The guilt over this sin is overwhelming and our only defense against it, if it is real, is to split the sin and guilt off, projecting them outside ourselves onto a made-up God, Who becomes the wrathful avenger, intent on vengeance against us for our sin against Him. But, as with each of the ego's splits, this leads to its own set of problems, requiring yet another defensive split. For if I exist in the mind with this maniacal God, bent on my destruction, I need to escape. And so the fourth and final split involves projecting my own identity out into a world of form and bodies, escaping my mind and hiding in the world. But what the ego has failed to tell me is that this solution involves the projection of all the contents of my wrong-mind into the world of form, so that I now live in a world of fear. For the sin and guilt are all still around me, but now external to me in the world and in all my relationships. And so the original vulnerability and fragility of the thought of separation in my mind is now the basis of my identity as a body in the world. Of course, the advantage of this final arrangement is that I am still an individual, but it seems that forces beyond my control have brought about my existence. And if I am the innocent victim of the sinful, guilty world, how can I be held accountable for that original attack on God. How could I possibly be that powerful? Just look at this pathetically weak self I am, despite my best efforts to strengthen and protect myself physically, psychologically and emotionally against a hostile world! And so it is here we find ourselves, as far removed from our true Identity as spirit as the ego could possibly entice us to go. And it is with this fourth split that the right-minded correction must begin. We are not asked to deny our experience of ourselves as bodies in the world--the result of the fourth split--but to be open to a different interpretation of that experience. Rather than focusing on differences as the ego has encouraged us to do--seeing my innocence as dependent on proving your guilt--A Course in Miracles is inviting us first to begin to recognize that we are all the same, struggling with our feelings of guilt by trying to project them on to everyone else. In other words, we all share the same guilt and the same need to be released from it. As we begin to accept this idea of shared interests, we will become more aware that we are a mind that is making choices to see the world and others in certain ways, rather than simply a victimized body, although we will almost certainly continue to experience ourselves as victims much of the time. And so we gradually begin to undo the final split. As we begin to see the world and our relationships differently, we will be more willing to look at the sin and guilt buried in our own mind, recognizing its real source in our identification with the ego, thereby beginning to reduce our investment in the third split. And the right-minded correction for this willingness to look honestly will be the recognition that there is an alternative in our mind to the sin, guilt, and fear that up until now we have felt the need to split off and project outside of ourselves. And that alternative is the Holy Spirit, the Reminder of the true innocence we share with everyone else, as we let go of the need to make differences real. And so the wall between the right mind and the wrong mind that we have attempted to make impenetrable with the second split begins to become more porous, allowing more of the light of the right mind to shine on the darkness of the wrong mind, revealing increasingly its illusory nature. The undoing of these three splits is the focus of the Course's teachings and it involves a process that will require great willingness on our part over time, for the self we are identified with in the world--the result of the fourth split--will lose its meaning and appeal to us over time as we practice the forgiveness that healing the splits requires. But along the way, that shift engenders tremendous fear so long as we still have an investment in the separation and in our separate, unique, individual self being real. At the end of the process, once we have allowed the barrier we have imposed between the right mind and the wrong mind to dissolve completely in the light of total forgiveness, we will be in the real world, still aware of the dream of separation but completely unaffected by it. And it is from this place of complete healing that we are ready for the undoing of the first split, accomplished by what the Course metaphorically refers to as God's last step (e.g., T-7.I), in which He lifts us up out of the illusion of duality and returns us to the absolute oneness of Heaven, which in reality we have never left. Although the process of undoing the splits is described here as if it were linear, in reality it is not, as the miracle, or the holy instant, which is involved in undoing the second, third, and fourth splits, occurs outside time and space. And so our experience will be that we will be moving back and forth between the various levels of the splits over and over again, over time. For example, the Holy Spirit may seem to be a part of our healing process almost from the beginning of our work with the Course, yet we will not really understand the nature of His reality until we have come to understand the nature of the split mind more fully. And despite our increasing recognition that our only real choice is made in the mind, we will continue to get caught in our victim scripts in the world and will need to remind ourselves that we are really the same as all our brothers and sisters. Those interested in a more in-depth exploration of the four splits may find the audio set, Separation and Forgiveness: The Four Splits and Their Undoing, and Volume I All Are Called from the two-volume book set, The Message of A Course in Miracles (both publications by Kenneth Wapnick) helpful."

Caring for my parents makes me question is forgiveness possible?",
    "output": "One of the big traps of the ego is to judge by form. Jesus pointedly reminds us, \"Nothing so blinding as perception of form\" (T-22.III.6:7). It is so difficult for us to accept that the mind is not the brain, and that all physical conditions are expressions of thoughts in the mind. Since we continually protect ourselves from recovering our awareness of ourselves as decision-making minds outside time and space, we depend almost entirely on our senses to tell us what is going on. That is the ego's goal--to keep our perception and judgments rooted entirely in the body and the world so that we would never return to our minds and discover that we can choose to see things differently. What would be helpful therefore is to go within and first realize that you are seeing through the ego's eyes, which blind you to anything other than form, and then ask for help to see through Jesus' eyes, which would help you get past the form to the content in the mind. Then you would know that forgiveness is not only possible but guaranteed: \"When you unite with me you are uniting without the ego, because I have renounced the ego in myself and therefore cannot unite with yours. Our union is therefore the way to renounce the ego in you. The truth in both of us is beyond the ego. Our success in transcending the ego is guaranteed by God, and I share this confidence for both of us and all of us\" (T-8.V.4:1-4)."

There appears to be a fear by many that we are losing our old-fashioned values, such as marriage, church, and God. Even in this dream we are living in, there are consequences for believing you hold the absolute truth and all others are wrong. Do you believe this could be the final stretch where fundamental Christianity in the U.S. finally takes its logic to cataclysmic results, and they will be forced to look deeper inside for the truth, as we are all trying to do, recognizing the ego's lies?",
    "output": "It is almost a truism that it is easier to see the egos in others than in ourselves, and what all too often follows is a sense of superiority for the greater understanding our recognition of others' foolish egos would seem to imply. But all this does is play into the ego's plan in our minds to keep the separation alive and real out there in the world. For it is the ego's goal that we see others' egos clearly so that we forget to look at our own, perhaps minimizing it or even denying its hold still on our own minds. Now this is not to deny the facts as you present them, in the world's terms. But possibly implicit in your question is the hope that others will use the probable effects of the seemingly disastrous choices we are making collectively as a nation as an eventual call to awaken. Perhaps that could be so, but still that would never be my concern in the present moment, when I have aligned myself with the only real Leader worth casting my vote for. For the choices the world seems to offer, no matter how different they appear to be, if I believe they really will make a difference, only mean that I continue to cast my lot with the ego. For there can be no hope in the world and to believe the outcome of any political election can make a difference in any real sense is to forget where the only real choice lies-- in the mind. The polarization or split between voters in the United States so frequently described in the media these days and alluded to in your question is only an external projection of the split within our own mind. And nothing needs to be done about the seemingly unbridgeable gap between voters in their values and beliefs about what is important in the world. But as students of A Course in Miracles, we do want to take an internal inventory of every value we continue to hold (T- 24.in.2), and question whether that value reinforces our belief in differences and separation, no matter how noble or seemingly inclusive the value may seem, if others are judged in any way for not sharing that value. So if there is one lesson that can be taken from the recent elections, it is that we can hold it up to our mind's eye as a mirror into the state of our own minds. For every reaction we have to something on the outside is in fact pointing to an area of hidden guilt within our own mind. And it is to those internal spots of seeming darkness that we can most fruitfully direct our attention, shining the shared light of forgiveness with the Holy Spirit, which allows us to recognize that we are truly the same as all our brothers and sisters, no matter what values we share or do not share."

    "text_input": "Q #633: Why do we keep creating multiple outer selves that seem to punish us?",
    "output": "Because we're insane but we don't yet really accept that we are! Your question suggests that you understand at some level that we create or, to be more accurate, miscreate the world and everyone in it, but that you can't make any sense out of just why we would do this, considering what our experience in the world and in our relationships seems to be. And A Course in Miracles' answer to your question is perhaps the major insight it offers that is not found in other spiritual teachings--its explanation of the purpose of the world. To understand that explanation, we need to be clear first of all that the miscreative \"power\" rests in the mind joined with the ego, outside of time and space, and not in the self in the world that we believe we are. For that self, along with the world and all the other \"outer selves,\" is a projection of the ego mind, made for a very specific purpose that the ego wants to keep from our awareness. We also need to be clear that the cause of everything we experience exists only in the mind and not in the world, contrary to what our experience seems to tell us. In fact, the world is an effect and not a cause. And more specifically, all the pain, guilt and fear, in whatever form we experience it--physical, emotional, psychological--is an effect of our choice for separation in the mind--the cause (T-28.II.7,11-12). If we really perceived that cause-effect connection in the mind, we'd soon choose against the thought of separation and the ego's days would be numbered. But the truth is we love the ego and its seeming gifts of individuality and specialness-- different words for the idea of separation--and are willing to pay almost any price to keep those \"gifts.\" And that price is a grand self-deception. We want to see the cause of all our pain, guilt and fear as outside ourselves rather than as a result of our own choice in the mind, so that we don't have to take responsibility for how we feel (T-26.X.4-5; T-27.I.1-4). And we avoid taking responsibility, not because of the guilt that the ego tells us this would force us to confront, but because our \"ignorance\" protects our concept of ourselves as separate, special individuals. To use this defense, however, we need a world and other bodies--external to a separate limited and weak self that we can believe we are--on which to pin the blame for how we feel. And so all of our relationships in the world ultimately have the purpose of shifting our focus away from the mind--essentially making us mindless-- and to the external world, so that we never uncover the true cause-effect relationship in the mind. And we still have our individuality and specialness, but any pain or guilt or fear associated with that is not our own fault. In other words, we need others \"to punish us\" so we can hold them responsible for our pain and never have to look inside to the real cause of the pain. It's insane, because essentially we are choosing to remain in pain and deny ourselves access to the only remedy for the pain. And we do not allow ourselves to remember what we are doing. But the hopeful news is that, once we can begin to realize, however dimly, what we in fact are doing to ourselves, we have made a choice for a different way. And that different way will involve now using each of our \"victim\" experiences as an opportunity to recognize that we have simply sided with the ego once again and made a choice for separation, and then have tried to deny responsibility for that choice and its consequences. The resistance to this acknowledgment is great, but as we practice looking honestly at what we are doing without judging ourselves, the defense will become increasingly transparent. We are making a choice to be unhappy that has nothing to do with anyone else, but we have become experts at finding someone else to hold responsible for how we feel so that we don't have to look any deeper. Over time, we will begin to see that, although we still may become angry and upset with others, it becomes more difficult to justify our feelings as we have in the past. And as this recognition grows, the investment in the anger and upset will recede. And we will see that all those other \"outer selves\" are really the same as we are, doing exactly what we have been doing, perhaps not in the same form but with the same content, calling desperately for love as they push it away."

    "text_input": "Q #634: When I have a conversation with family or friends, it may become a real discussion in which we give our opinion about a particular subject. Since I am a student of A Course in Miracles, I feel insecure about giving my opinion, especially when mine is different from others. I realize that the separation is there. I am aware that I don't need to convince my friend. Should I keep my mouth shut?",
    "output": "This situation could be a wonderful opportunity for you to practice what you have learned. As a Course student, you never want to forget to be normal, and normal people express opinions. So you can approach your conversations as a kind of laboratory in which you are going to learn how to disagree with someone without perceiving yourself as separate, without judging, and without the need to be right. This will happen if you show your ego the exit door, and choose Jesus or the Holy Spirit as your lab director instead. You would then look forward to these occasions, and there would be less and less tension or conflict because you would have chosen the right teacher and the right purpose. \"The Holy Spirit is the perfect Teacher ... The ego made the world as it perceives it, but the Holy Spirit, the reinterpreter of what the ego made, sees the world as a teaching device for bringing you home\" (T-5.III.10:1; 11:1)."

    "text_input": "Q #635: You wrote this reply to a previous question: \"As the Course reminds us clearly and repeatedly, our function is forgiveness. It is practiced by recognizing all the unloving thoughts and judgments we may have, asking for them to be transformed by the Holy Spirit. We then do what the Course invites us to do: 'Step gently aside, and let healing be done for you. Keep but one thought in mind and do not lose sight of it, however tempted you may be to judge any situation, and to determine your response by judging it. Focus your mind only on this: I am not alone, and I would not intrude the past upon my Guest. I have invited Him, and He is here. I need do nothing except not to interfere'\" (418).  For me the above paragraph completely summarizes the entire message of A Course in Miracles. My question/problem/dilemma is: How do we \"do nothing\" and \"not interfere\"? To say, as Ken does, that we should concentrate upon \"getting ourselves out of the way\" is meaningless without some idea as to how. I suspect that if the above instruction from Jesus could be mastered, salvation would rapidly result. There would be, quite simply, nothing left to do! I just do not know how, in \"practical\" terms, to go about \"doing nothing\" and \"not interfering.\"",
    "output": "Our own individual identity is so tied up in acting and doing with our body that we are likely to misinterpret what Jesus is asking of us here. He is not at all concerned with what our body may or may not do, since that is only ever an effect of thoughts in the mind. But he is very concerned with our mind (T-4.IV.2:9), for this is where all power to choose rests. And so the answer to getting ourselves out of the way is actually contained in the lines you have quoted above: \"It is practiced by recognizing all the unloving thoughts and judgments we may have, asking for them to be transformed by the Holy Spirit.\" This is our part--to recognize our ego thoughts, which always involve our own interpretation of situations, based on our perception of our personal needs and whether they are being met. This would encompass nearly every thought we have during our day! And so that is where the challenge lies--in recognizing those thoughts and then having the humility to acknowledge that we may be mistaken about what we need. For all of our thoughts of personal need are specific expressions of our decision to continue to make the past--the thought of separation--alive in our minds so that we believe that we are alone and lacking. Now obviously, so long as we identify ourselves with our bodies, we will have needs, and we're not being asked to deny them. But when we hold a thought that justifies anger, attack or upset when our needs are not met, or feelings of triumph and satisfaction when we get what we want, we are making an interpretation that actively interferes with the expression of the truth within us of Who we really are. So this is the kind of \"doing\" that Jesus is asking us to set aside within our minds, so that we can be open, unblocked channels for his love. When we have released all of our investment in the ego's interpretations of who we are and what we need, salvation will be ours. And only our own resistance to letting go will delay its arrival."

    "text_input": "Q #636: How many planes or levels of consciousness are there? All of us are familiar with the physical, since that's where we are focused, and many of us are also familiar with the astral plane, since it seems to be 'right next door,' and it appears that we just bounce back and forth between these two states. But what is the significance--within the illusion, of course--of the mental and causal planes (and even other planes of existence way beyond these) spoken about by so many metaphysicians? Is there a hierarchy--again, within the illusion--of consciousness? Is finding our way back to God like climbing Mount Everest, where we have to establish several base camps in each plane of consciousness that we sometimes have to return to before we can reach our final destination?",
    "output": "However many planes or levels of consciousness there may be is not the concern of A Course in Miracles: \"The structure of 'individual consciousness' is essentially irrelevant because it is a concept representing the 'original error' [separation] or the 'original sin' (C-in.1:4). The Course tells us our problem is that we believe the thought of separation that introduced consciousness (all levels and planes) in the first place (see T-3.IV.2) is real. The goal of the Holy Spirit's curriculum, as set forth in the Course, is to heal the mind of this thought. This healing is accomplished through the process of forgiveness, whereby the ego's perception is replaced by the Holy Spirit's. These principles are the foundation of the Course's teaching and provide us with the steps we are to take if we choose it as our path back to God. In studying the Course it is helpful to remember that whenever it refers to the body or the world it includes every aspect of each (including astral bodies, energy fields, consciousness, and planes of all types). They are all equally part of the illusion of separation, and are therefore not real. Jesus asks us some very unsettling questions in this regard: \"What if you recognized this world is an hallucination?\" (T-20.VIII.7:3) and \"Is it harder to dispel the belief of the insane in a larger hallucination as opposed to a smaller one? (M-8.5:2) This greatly simplifies things for us. However, we have great resistance to learning this important message of the Course, due to our attachment to identifying with the body. One way to make the separation and the world real is to establish a hierarchy of values, by which we measure the worth of all parts of the illusion. (See T-23.II.2:1-3.) The mind that is addressed in the Course is outside of time and space, beyond all levels of consciousness, mental planes, or astral bodies. It is the mind choosing to identify with the Holy Spirit, Who represents the memory of God that will enable us eventually to disidentify with every part of the hallucination. In this process it is not necessary to unravel, nor travel the winding \"circuitous routes\" of the ego's complexities: \"It is not necessary to follow fear through all the circuitous routes by which it burrows underground and hides in darkness, to emerge in forms quite different from what it is. Yet it is necessary to examine each one as long as you would retain the principle that governs all of them. When you are willing to regard them, not as separate, but as different manifestations of the same idea, and one you do not want, they go together\" (T-15.X.5:1-3). This passage contains not only the principles that respond to your question, but important information regarding the process of undoing the thought that put consciousness on the map, so to speak. The thought of separation has taken a multitude of forms. We are asked to become aware of how we use these many forms to disguise this single thought, so we can learn that they are all the same. We use them all to prove the world and the body are real. The Holy Spirit uses them to teach us they are nothing and will never give us what we truly want. Learning to identify more and more with the Holy Spirit in our minds instead of with the body is what leads us home. The only camp we need to set up is in our minds. That is where we find the light that will dispel the darkness of consciousness and the separation that gave it birth."

    "text_input": "Q #637: Can you address a couple of issues I'm having difficulty grasping about the Course?  The following answers are in response to different questions posed by the same person.  : A Course in Miracles claims that anger is simply a manifestation of the ego, based on fear. Yet scripture often talks about God's anger--e.g., the Great Flood, Sodom and Gomorra, the Israelites' idolatry in the desert. If God has no ego, how could He show anger? Or was it really something else? If it wasn't anger, what was it?",
    "output": "Your confusion about God is not surprising--many students new to the Course, coming from traditional Jewish or Christian backgrounds, share in it. But it can be easily addressed, although you'll have to decide for yourself on which side of the issue you'd like to settle. Quite simply, the God of the Bible is not the God of A Course in Miracles. The Course does describe and offer a correction for a \"God\" who gets angry, condemns and punishes, and demands sacrifice to appease His anger (e.g., T-3.I.1-4; T-9.V.3; T-23.II.4-8; W-pI.170; M-17.5-7). But according to the Course, this is the ego's made-up God, a major character in its elaborate myth, which asserts that the separation from God is real and actually happened, that it involved an attack on God, and that He is angry about that attack and is seeking retribution. None of this, according to the Course, is true, since the separation never happened in reality and God would no longer be God--perfect Love--if anger could be a part of Him. But this, the Course tells us, is what our ego wants us to believe, to assure its own survival. For the ego thrives on conflict--it literally is a thought of conflict--and it requires an enemy to maintain its own existence as something separate and apart. The real God of the Course is perfect Love and perfect Oneness, incapable of anger or condemnation, and completely unaffected by the Sonship's illusory thought of separation and attack. From these distinctions it follows that the God of the Bible can not be the same as the Course's true God, but rather bears a striking resemblance to the ego's made-up, angry, wrathful God. And there are many other differences between the Bible's God and the Course's God. In the Bible, God creates the physical world and everything that inhabits that world, including man and woman. He condemns and punishes Adam and Eve for their sin of disobedience against Him, and eventually sends His only Son to be sacrificed so that the otherwise irreversible effects of that sin that we all inherit can be atoned for. As you study the Course, it will become increasingly apparent that this God and the God of the Course share nothing in common. Jesus in the Course makes it clear that God did not create the world or bodies (e.g., T-4.I.11:6-7), has never been affected by our belief in separation and sin (e.g., T-30.III.10), and so could never demand sacrifice (e.g., T-3.I.4; T-11.VI.5). Furthermore, the Jesus of the Course is not God, but rather an aspect of the Sonship, equal to all his brothers and sisters, who has remembered the truth of Who he and all of us are as the one perfect Christ (T-1.II.3; C-5.2-5). Although each student should follow whatever path or paths he feels guided to, these differences in the nature of God are at the base of our position that the Course and traditional Christianity are mutually exclusive spiritual teachings that cannot be reconciled. #439, as well as the audio set, The Bible from the Perspective of A Course in Miracles, also address the issue of the relationship between the Course and biblical teachings. : I am beginning to realize that the Course deals only with thoughts, not behavior. Yet the age-old behavioral questions still remain. If we treat the traditional concept of \"sin\" as merely an illusion of the ego self, how does one determine right from wrong? If sin is not real then I can do anything I want without fear of punishment or disciplinary action. If the justice system was governed by the Course, does that mean that there would be no punishment because the \"attack\" was only an illusion of the ego acting through the body? Does the Course mean to imply that society's response to criminal acts should be to forgive the offender rather than punish or otherwise \"discipline\" them? How are we as a society supposed to function without agreed-upon rules of conduct and the means to enforce them? A: Out of context, it may seem that to say sin is not real means it does not matter what we do. And at an ultimate metaphysical level, this is true. But the problem is, all of us who believe we are here in the world must also believe in sin and its laws of pain and punishment, and so to think that we can behave in any way we want with no consequences to ourselves would be foolish at best and tragic at worst (T-5.VI.1:3-4). The Course is never making any statements about what is or is not acceptable behavior, and for most minds, not ready to accept the complete responsibility for our own experience that the Course teaches we must eventually learn to accept (T-21.II.2), rules governing external behavior are a practical necessity. There is nothing in the Course that says these should be ignored or eliminated. And it is possible to provide consequences for behavioral transgressions with the intent of restraining harmful and destructive behavior, but without the intention of punishing (you may wish to review Questions #371, #484, and #584 for further discussion of the issues around setting limits and making decisions within the illusion). However, behaving \"appropriately\" will not in itself lead to salvation. Change must occur at the level of mind, from which \"appropriate\" behavior will then follow. The Course, while not concerned with right and wrong behavior, does distinguish between right- and wrong-minded thinking or perception (T-3.IV.4), asserting that thought is the level at which the distinction needs to be made, since behavior is only ever an effect or result of the thoughts in the mind. Jesus makes this point several times early in the Course: \"You cannot behave appropriately unless you perceive correctly\" (T-1.III.6:5). \"I have said that you cannot change your mind by changing your behavior, but I have also said, and many times, that you can change your mind\" (T-4.IV.2:1). \"I have enjoined you to behave as I behaved, but we must respond to the same Mind to do this. This Mind is the Holy Spirit, Whose Will is for God always. He teaches you how to keep me as the model for your thought, and to behave like me as a result\" (T-5.II.12:1-3). \"We have learned that behavior is not the level for either teaching or learning, since you can act in accordance with what you do not believe\" (T-7.V.2:4). And later in the text, \"Seek not to change the world, but choose to change your mind about the world\" (T-21.in.1:7). In perhaps the clearest discussion of this point in the Course, Jesus says: \"You would not excuse insane behavior on your part by saying you could not help it. Why should you condone insane thinking? There is a confusion here that you would do well to look at clearly. You may believe that you are responsible for what you do, but not for what you think. The truth is that you are responsible for what you think, because it is only at this level that you can exercise choice. What you do comes from what you think ... It is pointless to believe that controlling the outcome of misthought can result in healing ... You must change your mind, not your behavior, and this is a matter of willingness. You do not need guidance except at the mind level. Correction belongs only at the level where change is possible. Change does not mean anything at the symptom [behavioral] level, where it cannot work\" (T-2.VI.2:2-7; 3:1,4-7). Wrong-minded, or ego-based, thinking is always predicated on the belief in separate interests, which must produce pain and guilt for the wrong-minded thinker, who is identifying with the ego. For in his own mind he is making sin --the separation--real, and the ego thought system has been set up in such a way that pain and guilt inevitably follow. So it would be self- destructive and self-defeating to believe that we can act any way we want with impunity. If we fully understood and appreciated the Course's teachings on the cause of our own pain and suffering, we would never consider using any of the Course's principles as justification for attacking anyone. The recognition that sin is not real is not simply an intellectual understanding. We will know that we truly have accepted sin's unreality when we are no longer identified with the physical self and personality we now we believe we are. Until then, since the world is literally a projection of our own guilty self, any seeming attack on the world outside ourselves must be an attack on ourselves, with all the painful consequences (e.g., W-pI.196). So whatever you may have been thinking of doing, don't do it!"

    "text_input": "Q #638: \"Let me perceive forgiveness as it is\" is a prayer from the student's workbook (W- pI.134). In the text we learn that forgiveness is a kind of selective remembering (T-17.III.1:3). This refers to the mind. In my opinion perception takes place on the material plane using our senses. Following this: How can we than perceive forgiveness in any way?",
    "output": "This is extremely difficult for us to comprehend, but the teachings of A Course in Miracles always pertain to the mind, because the body with its senses, along with the external world in which it seems to exist are nothing but the projection of thoughts in the mind: thoughts of separation and the sin, guilt, and fear associated with separation from God. The body is the embodiment of these thoughts, not something autonomous. This is the basis for some very radical--shocking, to many--statements in the Course, such as: \"Yet sights and sounds the body can perceive are meaningless. It cannot see or hear. It does not know what seeing is; what listening is for. It is as little able to perceive as it can judge or understand or know. Its eyes are blind; its ears are deaf ... They were made to look upon a world that is not there ...\" (T-28.V.4:4-8; 5:4). The Course uses the term false perception for this. So forgiveness is part of the process of replacing the ego's purpose for the body (to reinforce the belief in separation) with the Holy Spirit's purpose, which is to restore true perception to our minds, where we perceive everyone as the same, sharing the same goal of returning home to God. We thus learn how to remember only what reflects the truth of our oneness as God's Son, and forget all else, because all else is meaningless. This is the function of true perception, the correction for false perception (C.4)."

Is there some part of the Course I could read to help me with this issue? My wife and I have been to counseling, but I wanted to look at it through A Course in Miracles' view which is altogether different.",
    "output": "The Course says nothing about staying or leaving a relationship, since its message is not about behavior. It is only about the thought system and the teacher we have chosen in our minds. There does not have to be a conflict between marriage counseling and the Course approach to relationships, just as there need not be a conflict between practicing the Course's approach to healing and using traditional medicine for health problems at the same time. Jesus, as our kind, wise teacher, encourages us to use this compromise approach as we progress along our spiritual path with him. Eventually, we will not need the \"magic,\" but most of us are not that far along yet. There is nothing wrong in pursuing marriage counseling while you are studying the Course's view of relationships. In essence, the advice of the Course is that your decision to leave or stay be made in a state of peace within your mind. It never advocates \"sticking it out\" for the purpose of forgiveness even though you find the pain of staying unbearable. Whatever lesson is not learned can be learned in another relationship; we never have only one chance to learn forgiveness. The Course, above all, is a gentle path, and Jesus as our teacher, above all, is patient, as he knows time is unreal and in the end we are undoing something that never happened. Looking at relationships from the Course's view means asking for help to look within your mind at your thoughts of specialness, judgment, victimization, guilt, and fear, and then observing how these influence the way you relate to your spouse. If you are coming from your wrong mind (the ego thought system of separation), you will always experience your interests as conflicting with your spouse's in some way, and that in order to have your needs met, your spouse must sacrifice, and vice versa. In the ego thought system, it is always one or the other. That is the source of a great deal of the tension in relationships; and as long as the relationship is rooted in the ego thought system, that can never change. The good feelings usually are a result of having one's needs met. That is the core of the special love relationship, because all special love is based on the need to fill the emptiness and lack within that is a result of our having split off the love that is our true Identity. There is something missing, and we turn to someone outside us to make us complete. So special love involves taking something from someone and giving in return-- which supposedly makes it a \"happy\" relationship. True happiness, however, can be achieved only when the purpose of the relationship shifts from specialness (having one's needs fulfilled) to the holiness inspired by the Holy Spirit's or Jesus' purpose of forgiveness, which means that the value of the relationship is now seen to lie solely in its potential to be a means of learning that you and your spouse ultimately share the same interests: You share a wrong mind contaminated with the self-centered goal of specialness and separation, a right mind infused with the selfless goal of inclusiveness and unity, and a decision- making mind that always chooses one of these. So the question Jesus asks us to ask ourselves in relation to another person is \"Do I really wish to see him sinless?\" (T-20.VII.9:2). That forces us to look deep beneath the surface at the purpose of the relationship. If it is grounded in the one- or-the-other ego principle, the relationship would have as its purpose your maintaining your innocence at the expense of your spouse's sinfulness, so you would tend to put the blame for problems on your spouse. Fault-finding is very important to the ego! If it is grounded in the Holy Spirit's principle of oneness, the relationship would have as its purpose your willingness to look with Jesus at the interests you share in common with your spouse, so that you would wind up saying nothing about your spouse that you would not be willing to say about yourself. There would be a growing sense of the sameness you share, and the differences would decrease in importance. This holds for you, regardless of what is going on with your spouse. The readings we recommend are: \"The Healed Relationship\" and \"Setting the Goal\" (T- 17.V,VI)."

    "text_input": "Q #640: I have always had difficulty with special love relationships, searching for a partner who matched certain ego criteria such as intelligence, similar aesthetic sensibilities, and a sense of adventure. Needless to say, none of them lasted. Then three years ago I met someone who did not match my criteria, but I was struck by his kindness, and what appears to be the closest thing to unconditional love that I have found. Although I find my love for him to be very deep, it did not originate with the bells and \"GA GA I am so in love\" drama that I have experienced before. And I have had one foot in and one foot out for the duration, causing him much harm.

This is very short lived, and then I am right back where I started.",
    "output": "Ambivalence, or conflict, is the hallmark of the ego's special love relationship (T-4.III.4:6), as you've experienced with the romantic relationships you describe, including your current one. The real problem however is not in the relationship with the other person but in your relationship with yourself in your own mind. Your experience with your partner only symbolizes the conflict in your mind about accepting the love that you really want but that your choice to identify with your ego denies you. Your observations suggest you have some awareness of this dynamic, but let's elaborate on it. The desire to get something from the other must pervade our perception of romantic relationships, for the desire for any form of special love relationship means we are operating from the ego premise that something is missing in us that we need to seek outside ourselves to find (T-29.VII). This perception only reinforces the ambivalence, for in wanting something from others, we must at some level resent that we have to try to get it from them. And this is all part of the ego's setup to make certain that we are never happy. The fact is there is no one outside of ourselves who could ever fulfill our need for love--in reality there is no one outside of ourselves! All that we truly need is within, awaiting but our invitation. That you did not use your ego \"criteria\" to evaluate your current partner before deciding to enter into the relationship does not mean that those expectations are not still operating and reinforcing your ambivalence. For you have to resent that you are settling for something less than what you believe you really want and need. And your ego would have you believe that if those specific needs are not somehow being met, you are sacrificing something. But the external criteria are only the ego's diversionary tactics to make sure that you don't address the real ambivalence within. If we don't feel complete and fulfilled and loved and loving, it has nothing to do with the other person. We are continuing to refuse the love within that Jesus holds out to us in every moment, insisting instead that we must have it on our own terms, in a form we have defined as acceptable. And so we remain unhappy and empty--by our own choice. The real value of the special love relationship, under the Holy Spirit's guidance, is that it serves as a reminder of the choice within that we stubbornly keep making against love, which, when we acknowledge it, leaves the door open for a different choice and a different Voice. So you want continue to look at all the judgments and beliefs about the relationship and your partner and recognize that, whatever form they take, they all reflect the same recurring decision to identify with the ego and its dedication to lack. Whether we remain in any particular relationship or decide to leave it is, in the end, irrelevant to the solution. If the choice within remains for the ego and its belief in lack, each future relationship will be as fruitless and unsatisfying as the present one. But the opportunity to welcome a different inner Teacher is always available. We can delay as long as we want but, as Jesus implores, \"How soon will you be ready to come home? Perhaps today? There is no sin. Creation is unchanged. Would you still hold return to Heaven back? How long, O holy Son of God, how long?\" (W-pII.4.5:3-8). For more on the ego's ambivalence in special relationships, see Question #359."

    "text_input": "Q #641: Please explain \"The Healed Relationship\" and the subsequent sections in A Course in Miracles. This section states that when we turn a relationship over to the Holy Spirit that \"many relationships have been broken off at this point, and the pursuit of the old goal re-established in another relationship\" (T-17.V.3:8). Yet it continues that we must have faith in our brother and that eventually we will have peace in this relationship. I find these sections quite confusing especially if the relationship was broken off. How long must we wait to get peace in the relationship if we stay?",
    "output": "Turning a relationship over to the Holy Spirit means that you consciously decide that you will ask for help to use the relationship to undo the thoughts of separation in your mind. You get in touch with those thoughts by observing your reactions to your partner: the inner and the outer are the same, as Jesus teaches in several early lessons in the workbook. All of our relationships begin as special relationships--that is normal--so we would be expressing the ego thought system in our interactions. We thus would be using relationships to have our needs met (which leads to ritualistic gift-giving, celebrations, etc.), to get rid of our own guilt (feeling justified in pointing out faults in our partner), to validate our worth as individuals (what would I do without you?), and to reinforce our belief in the reality of victimization, sacrifice, and conflict. When the ego's purpose is replaced by the Holy Spirit's, your experience would change accordingly, as is obvious from the ego attributes just listed. What would it be like to have all of that shift to but one goal: to desire to perceive only what makes you one with your partner, with all else rendered meaningless? That scares many people off, as at that point the relationship seems \"disturbed, disjunctive and even quite distressing\" (T-17.V.3:3). Out of fear, then, many people would just turn to someone else with whom they could have a relationship the old way, with the old meaning. There is no way of knowing how long it would take to experience peace if you stay in the relationship once you begin to make the shift in purpose. All that Jesus says is that \"this is the time for faith\" (T-17.V.6:1), which means that you trust, with good reason, that his way is better than yours. You would not have asked for help if you were satisfied with the way things were going; so, like Helen and Bill, you must have concluded that there is a better way of relating than you are aware of. It is not easy to go through these stages of disorientation and distress, but there's no way around it because of our fear and resistance to what seems unfamiliar--even though we are really just reverting to our natural state of oneness, reflected in our seeing shared interests instead of separate interests. None of this should be taken to mean that you should not do things that normal people do in relationships, nor does it mean that you should stay in a relationship that has become intolerably painful. Peace is the goal, and that has nothing to do with what your body seems to be doing. It has to do only with which teacher you have chosen in your mind to teach you the meaning of your relationship. When you become concerned about how long the shift seems to be taking, you can be sure that you have turned to the ego, for Jesus is totally unconcerned with time and cares only about your trust in his unconditional love for you--a love that excludes no one."

    "text_input": "Q #642: I'm trying to understand exactly what is meant by looking at the ego without judgment. When I attempt to do this, two options seem to come up: (1) I feel I have to exert my will to do this, but then the non-judging feels forced and intellectual, or (2) I leave it to the Holy Spirit to show me how to look at the ego without judgment, but I'm not getting much help from that quarter; I feel as guilty and unhappy about what my ego does as I ever did. Am I misunderstanding something? Am I simply impatient? Am I doing it wrong?",
    "output": "Your experience is a very common one for students of A Course in Miracles. However unsuccessful we may seem to be, every effort to do as the Course teaches is an expression of a \"little willingness\" (T-26.VII.10:1), and is a step in the right direction. In fact, one of the ways to look at the ego without judgment is not to evaluate progress with the Course. As we are told in the text: \"Some of your greatest advances you have judged as failures, and some of your deepest retreats you have evaluated as success\" (T-18.V.1:6). Looking at the ego without judgment is a process that takes practice because it is not easy to do. The very life of the ego is based on a judgment; i.e., believing the separation is a real and serious sin, that has cost us our innocence and peace, and we will never get them back. The guilt and fear that follow this judgment give rise to all the antics of the ego, experienced in the world in a myriad of forms. When the ego's ploys are uncovered and projections are recognized for what they are, there is a tendency to feel more guilty and miserable: \"... as blame is withdrawn from without, there is a strong tendency to harbor it within. It is difficult at first to realize that this is exactly the same thing, for there is no distinction between within and without\" (T-11.IV.4.5-6). Just as light is initially painful to one who has been blind, uncovering the ego can be painful. Resistance to looking is an expression of the desire to be right about the ego's interpretation of who we are, in direct opposition to the Identity God gave us. The judgment, guilt, resistance, and insistence on being right are all made in defense of the choice to be separate. They are purposeful and accomplish their goal of making the separation real. It is not surprising this is difficult to look at. The Course does not ask us not to judge, but rather to recognize the judgments we do make, including the judgment against ourselves for judging. This recognition is an important step in the process of undoing the ego's defense strategy, so another choice can eventually be made. Willingness to see the ego in operation, and not call it by any other name, justify it, nor blame anyone else for it, is a way of not judging, as well as an invitation to the Holy Spirit to transform our perception. As the One Who represents the part of our minds that does not believe the ego's lie of separation, it is He Who actually looks without judgment. Recognizing our mistaken judgments about ourselves and the world, and being willing not to decide for ourselves what anything means, weakens the ego's defense and allows us to begin to hear the Holy Spirit's \"still, small Voice\" (T-21.V.1:6) telling us we are wrong about the \"sin\" of separation. This does not happen by anything external to ourselves, nor by any special work of the Holy Spirit, but by the choice in our minds to decide against the ego's interpretation. The Holy Spirit's perception then automatically replaces ours. Since we are undoing a belief in something that doesn't truly exist, we have no need to panic. Jesus tells us many times and in many ways that we should proceed gently in this process. He tells us in \"Rules for Decision Making\": \"Do not fight yourself\" (T-30.I.1:7), and in the manual: \"...God has sent His Judgment [the Holy Spirit] to answer yours. Gently His Judgment substitutes for yours\" (M-11.3:4-5) [italics ours]. Again, all that is required is a \"little willingness\" to recognize that what the Holy Spirit represents is true, while the insane judgments of the ego, no matter how vicious and hateful they may be, are not."

    "text_input": "Q #643: I am going through an extremely stressful period of my life and \"need\" to believe that God is helping me through it and will make sure I'm okay. Yet, I realize this is not what A Course in Miracles teaches, as God doesn't even know we exist; it says that we only need to see our circumstances differently so we will feel at peace. I am finding that difficult to be at peace with whatever comes of my situation and want to believe that God is helping. How do I find comfort that all will work out? I guess I need to know that I am not alone in solving my issues and facing challenges each day.",
    "output": "First, there are probably very few Course students who do not feel this way at some point as they go through trying circumstances. It is perfectly normal to want the assurance that things are going to work out, and to want to be comforted during periods of extreme stress. It would be a little strange if you did not have such feelings and expectations. In fact, you would not need the Course if you did not react that way. Near the beginning of The Song of Prayer pamphlet, Jesus talks about prayer as a ladder, the bottom rungs representing the stages in our lives when, for whatever reason, we are focused on our physical and psychological needs as a body in the world. And he never says this is wrong or spiritually harmful. We need only be honest in acknowledging that we are spiritual children and are not at the top of the ladder yet. Thus we will experience God's Love in a form that suits our need. It is not the fullness of love because of our fear of accepting the fullness of our Identity beyond the body. But that does not mean that we cannot experience the comforting and reassuring presence of Heaven's reflection in our right minds: the Holy Spirit or Jesus. Jesus makes it clear throughout the Course that he knows what we are going through, and that his (and the Holy Spirit's) guidance and comfort are ever-present. Your confidence that God is all-loving and would never seek to punish or attack His creations is a significant step forward--which leads to the further reassurance that all will work out because His unchanging Love is our only reality. It is a very advanced state to be completely without investment in how things work out in our lives. We just need to accept where we are on our spiritual journey and not judge ourselves because we have not fully integrated into our experience what we know to be the truth intellectually. That is a gradual process that gently unfolds over a period of time as our fear of accepting Jesus' answer without compromise lessens more and more. Thus, journeying along our spiritual path we need but recall his loving assurance, \"You do not walk alone. God's angels hover near and all about. His Love surrounds you, and of this be sure; that I will never leave you comfortless\" (W-ep.6:6-8). See #538 for some additional commentary."

    "text_input": "Q #644: Could you comment on psychic powers? If someone says they are asking for guidance from the Holy Spirit, are they always right or can what they predict be changed? How can someone predict something years prior to it happening? And can what they predict be changed? For example: a psychic predicts that your child would become ill, or your marriage will end or even on a positive note, you will finally meet your dream person and get married. I have friends that really believe in what these people say because what they say comes true. How can I become my own reliable source to questions I refer to the Holy Spirit?",
    "output": "A good rule of thumb to follow is that when you receive specific answers, such as the ones in your example, you should be suspicious. In general, the Holy Spirit does not answer in specifics, primarily because He is trying to help us move beyond the specifics of the ego's world to the contents in our mind. Our decision to believe that the contents in our wrong mind (separation, sin, guilt, fear) are the truth, is the real problem. Our personal problems in the world are all smokescreens intended to keep us away from our mind so we will remain forever wedded to the ego thought system, without ever knowing that that ongoing decision is the real source of our unhappiness and lack of peace. So your asking for help of the Holy Spirit should be in the context of your desire to look at the contents in your mind that are the cause of all your seeming problems in the world. \"The Holy Spirit takes you gently by the hand, and retraces with you your mad journey outside yourself, leading you gently back to the truth and safety within. He brings all your insane projections ... that you have placed outside you to the truth. Thus He reverses the course of insanity and restores you to reason\" (T-18.I.8:3-5). A very helpful explanation of the roles of Jesus and the Holy Spirit can be found in chapters 4 and 5 in Few Choose to Listen, Volume Two of Kenneth's book, The Message of A Course in Miracles. We can provide only a brief response to your question about psychic phenomena. The topic of time raises complex issues, which have been addressed at length in some of our publications-- especially Kenneth's book, A Vast Illusion: Time According to A Course in Miracles. Briefly, then, within our dream of separation, Jesus tells us that time is not linear, even though that is how we experience it, owing to the ego's strategy of convincing us of the reality of sin (the past), guilt (the present), and fear (the future). Every conceivable form of separation already exists, as if in a video library, to use one of the analogies in Kenneth's book. We (our decision-making mind outside time and space) have access to all of them all the time (pardon the pun). So \"prediction\" amounts simply to the mind's choice to view a particular video. This is understandable, again, only if time is viewed as holographic, not linear. Now, the contents of the videos do not change; but there exists another library, the Holy Spirit's corrected version of the ego's script, to which we also have unlimited access. Thus, to choose one of these videos is to choose His interpretation of the events in our lives. That is what can change, not the ego's script. In other words, guilt demands punishment, and so many things would happen in our lives that express (by our own choice) our belief that we deserve to be punished for our sinfulness and that we are unworthy of a peaceful, happy life. If, however, we call that belief into question and choose Jesus or the Holy Spirit as our Teacher, then our choice of video would be from the \"corrected script\" of the Holy Spirit. The need to experience victimization would have changed, and we would then not have victimization experiences at all, or we would go through them peacefully, knowing that our true self is not defined or affected by what goes on in the body or the world. Jesus is our model for that shift: he did not perceive or experience himself as a persecuted victim even though his body had been nailed to a cross. What would help the most is to keep in mind is that it is not the psychic ability per se that is important, but rather the purpose that it serves. Jesus reminds us again and again that we have but one purpose, and that is forgiveness, or undoing the blocks to our awareness of love's presence in our minds. If you can keep that as your primary objective, you will recognize and then not be led astray by the ego's use of psychic ability, which is always to reinforce our sense of specialness and to make the world of time and space real."

    "text_input": "Q #645: Are there any elements of the physical resurrection of Jesus as depicted in the Bible and popular movies that are consistent with A Course in Miracles?",
    "output": "The Course does not give any account of the physical resurrection of Jesus. What it refers to in speaking of Jesus' and our resurrection is awakening from the dream, by making a choice in the mind to identify with the mind of the Sonship as it was created by God. Jesus knew, as we all know in some part of our minds, that he was God's innocent Son. The difference between him and us is that is all he knew. He did not identify with the body. If he did in fact appear in bodily form to his disciples after his crucifixion, it would have been no different from his manifestation in form prior to the crucifixion. In other words, he was not a body before nor after his death and resurrection. The Course, therefore, clearly differs with biblical teaching. In fact, the fundamental principles of traditional Christianity and A Course in Miracles are mutually exclusive. While belief in the world, the body, and sin are essential to Christian theology, the Course tells us they do not exist. (See: W-pI.132.6:2; W-pI.167.6; T-26.VII.10:5.) These essential differences are the foundation of the Course's reinterpretation of Christian biblical teaching. There is no accurate historical evidence of the events of Jesus' life 2,000 years ago. Scripture scholars agree that the gospels are unreliable reports, and so we cannot be sure that anything about the crucifixion or resurrection stories is true. We can be certain of the content of Jesus' message in the Course. Since there is no sin, there are no grounds for the guilt that is the bedrock of belief in victimization through crucifixion. Jesus tells us in the text: \"The message the crucifixion was intended to teach was that it is not necessary to perceive any form of assault in persecution, because you cannot be persecuted\" (T-6.I.4:6). The innocent cannot perceive persecution, and the Course is teaching us we are innocent, because the separation (for which we feel guilty) never happened. (M-2.2:7-8) Our resurrection is our acceptance of innocence: \"That [the resurrection] is the symbol of the release from guilt by guiltlessness\" (T-14.V.10:3). This is what is meant by accepting the Atonement (T-2.V.5:1). Simply put, the crucifixion of God's Son occurs when a choice is made in the mind to identify with the body by believing that separation from God is real, and the resurrection is a choice in the mind to accept that He is innocent, because the separation never happened. This is the \"tiny change of mind by which the crucifixion is changed to resurrection\" (T-21.II.1:2)."

    "text_input": "Q #646: If I were to perceive someone as a \"blissninny,\" would that be an ego projection/ judgment on my part? Is perceiving someone as a \"blissninny\" a value judgment on my part as a way to see myself as more spiritually advanced, or is there a healing aspect to this perception?",
    "output": "Seeing someone as a blissninny because they see the positive aspect of all things and deny the dark side of the ego, could be a simple observation. However, if a judgment is made that because they are blissninnies they are inferior beings, or \"Course sinners\" who should be cleansed of their sinful, blissy ways, then certainly this is the ego projecting guilt by standing in condemnation of a brother. The ego's motive could be to perceive yourself as more spiritually advanced, as you suggest, which only means being as fearful as the blissninny. A blissninny is not a sinner because of blissninniness, any more than anyone is a sinner for projecting and judging. In different form they are the same mistake. The blissninny says: \"I fear I am such a miserable sinner that I must deny the darkness within, and cover it over with sugar and spice.\" The \"spiritually advanced\" person says: \"I am such a miserable sinner, that I must find others who are bigger sinners so they will be punished instead of me.\" The healing aspect of this perception is that it uncovers the error so it can be healed through forgiveness. It is important to remember that the practice of forgiveness has nothing to do with changing anyone's behavior, including one's own. It means recognizing that the projection and judgment occur as the result of guilt in the mind for having chosen to believe the separation is real. This belief is the sin we accuse ourselves of and feel guilty about. We then become fearful that we will be found out and punished by God. Once we embark on this insane spiral of the ego's logic, we are compelled to seek and find other \"bigger\" sinners to take the rap for us. The ego is particularly fond of \"spiritual\" sinners like blissninnies, whom we accuse of the grievous sin of misinterpreting and misusing the Course. This is an example of the ego's trick of disguising itself in spiritual specialness to justify attack on \"lesser\" beings. Many such attacks have been \"excused\" by students with the claim: \"At least I know what I'm doing,\" or \"At least I'm not in denial.\" The simple solution is a return to the practice of forgiveness. If, in fact, I do know what I'm doing, and am not in denial, then, if I choose to, I can see that I have identified with the ego, and projected the guilt for doing so on this unsuspecting \"happy\" person. The next step is to ask for help to make another choice. Healing is now possible because the guilt and fear, judgment and attack, have been uncovered, and recognized for what they are. Therefore, they no longer need to be projected outward. Any judgment about ourselves or others can he transformed by the Holy Spirit through this process of forgiveness. Only the willingness to give Him every mistaken perception is required: \"The Holy Spirit asks of you but this; bring to Him every secret [judgment] you have locked away from Him. Open every door to Him, and bid Him enter the darkness and lighten it away\" (T-14.VII.6:1-2)."

    "text_input": "Q #647: As I have moved through the material in A Course in Miracles, I feel that I have gained insight into others' behavior more and more, and their specialness motives are more and more transparent to me. It makes me depressed sometimes when I see people whom I used to respect and admire coming from a space of specialness; and what I used to regard as their \"kindness\" and \"thoughtfulness\" are seen for what they are: manipulation. Can you comment on this? Is this just me letting idols go and becoming disillusioned?",
    "output": "There are two ways of looking at specialness: through the harsh, judgmental eyes of the ego, or the gentle, forgiving eyes of Jesus or the Holy Spirit. If you choose the ego, you would see specialness primarily in others, condemn it there rather than in yourself so you would not have to deal with the guilt, and then justify feeling even more separate from these formerly nice people than you were before. The ego thus would have snared you and achieved its objective of making separation and sinfulness real, binding you to itself through depression and disillusionment. If you choose to look with forgiving eyes, however, you would be joined with Jesus in realizing, first, that everyone is involved in the same self-deception for the same reason, and that everyone shares the same solution in their right minds and the same ability to choose it. Second, you would also realize that the ego has no power over love, and so there would be no reason to react negatively to the specialness that is the mark of ego identification. It is just part of the tiny, mad idea that it is possible to change the eternal Oneness of God's Being into separated fragments, and to replace Love that extends Itself eternally without limits with a pseudo-love that involves limitations, competition, sacrifice, and loss. Jesus advises us that we ought only to laugh at such a ridiculous thought. Thus, specialness is spawned by an idea that the impossible is possible. So you would judge and get depressed over specialness only if you think it is real in some way. Then, too, as you suggest, the special love relationships you have formed with those you have admired for their kindness, thoughtfulness, etc., have been substitutes for the only real relationship, which is with God or with His reflection in your mind, Jesus. When you begin to see the falsity of special love, it comes as a disillusioning shock because you were not aware of the role it played in covering your guilt for having separated from your Source. But if you now perceive it with the forgiving eyes of Jesus, you will see only a silly mistake that has had no effect on truth and reality. By not judging others for indulging in specialness, you will be releasing yourself from a damning self-accusation that has been kept in concealment. And by seeing past the choice for specialness in others to the fear that motivated that choice, and past that to the love the fear is hiding, you will finally reach the place within where you perceive your oneness with everyone else. Judgment then is replaced by compassion and peace."

    "text_input": "Q #648: Ken is very diligent about reminding us of A Course in Miracles' teaching regarding bringing the darkness to the light. That being the case, what do you say about: \" ... I am ... alert to the revelation-readiness of my brothers. I can thus bring down to them more than they can draw down to themselves\" [T-1.II.5:1-2]. Also, \"I have said already that I can reach up and bring the Holy Spirit down to you ... \" [T-5.I.3:2].",
    "output": "Bringing the darkness to the light means bringing all the thoughts of guilt in our mind to the light of Jesus' or the Holy Spirit's true forgiveness, where they can be released back into the nothingness that is their source. In contrast, bringing the light to the darkness means trying to bring Jesus or the Holy Spirit (the light) into the world (the darkness) to solve our problems here, as we have defined them and believe they exist. Since the problems of the world are only ever projections of the guilt in our mind, our approach is doomed to failure because we are never addressing the underlying problem of the guilt, falling instead for the ego's smokescreen in the world, in our external relationships. But if we can begin to recognize that those external problems are simply symbols of the guilt in our mind, we can reverse the process and return our attention to the underlying problem, the choice for guilt in the mind. However, the temptation will remain very strong to see our problems as outside of ourselves--hence the need for great diligence on our part. The lines you quote, which come early in the Course, when the language was a little less precise and the style somewhat affected by Helen's fear, are not inconsistent with this. The bringing down that Jesus refers to does not mean bringing the Holy Spirit or God into the world, but must be understood in light of the distinction Jesus makes, in the previous paragraph in the first section you cite, between the horizontal axis (in time, which is illusory) and the vertical axis (in the mind). Jesus is making clear here that on our own, we can not bridge the vertical distance in our mind between the limited self we believe we are and our perfect and limitless reality as God's Son. And so we need a help, symbolized specifically by Jesus in our mind, to cover that otherwise uncrossable gap, who can bring a qualitatively different kind of experience to our mind if we are willing to join with him. These references have nothing to do with anything in the world and are speaking only of an experience of complete and total oneness that can barely be sustained while we cling to an identity rooted in the world of time and space."

    "text_input": "Q #649: I am new to A Course in Miracles and totally fascinated with its concepts. I've been trying to do the lessons one per day as the Course instructs. Sometimes it is not possible for me to do the 3 to 4 times daily exercises of each applicable idea and I find myself going back to the previous lessons to make sure \"I got them right.\" Today, for example, I went back to lessons 1 through 8, and I found in them things I did not notice before. It elated me for a while, but now I feel kind of depressed. Am I doing something wrong? Am I overdoing? Can you explain?",
    "output": "It is not at all necessary to do the lessons over because you realized you missed important aspects of them the first time. It is quite normal to miss things--even after the third or fourth reading. There are layers of meaning, and you will comprehend only what you are ready for at any given moment. Your continued study and practice of the Course will prepare you to go more deeply into the teachings; but it is important to remember always that this is a process that will extend over many, many years. So you need not be concerned that missing something now will seriously affect your spiritual progress. We assure you that you will meet up with it again later. The ego would have you view the process as strictly linear, whereas the more you turn away from the ego and toward Jesus or the Holy Spirit to help you, the more gentle and kind you will be with yourself, as you will realize that the process is not restricted by time at all. The whole purpose of the workbook exercises is to reduce your guilt and eventually enable you to let it go entirely, so if you are feeling any sense of guilt or pressure, you know that the ego has sneaked in and is attempting to steer you back in its direction. Just smile gently when you become aware of that ploy and remind yourself that Jesus' way is the way of gentleness and calmness--never any pressure. Other students have had similar concerns and so you might benefit from reading our answers to #64, #92, and #230. We refer in these answers to Lesson 95, where Jesus tells his students what to do when they become aware that they have been remiss in their practice of the lessons. His discussion of this concern is quite important and helpful."

    "text_input": "Q #650: I would like to encourage my study group to address the metaphysics of A Course in Miracles. I thought one way to introduce it would be to find the references for the \"observer\" or the \"decision maker\" in the text. Could you give me perhaps five places in the text to study that would allow my group members to begin the process of watching their minds?",
    "output": "In a sense, the whole Course is about learning to recognize our ego, stepping back from it and observing it, and growing in understanding of what the consequences are of choosing it, so that we can make a different choice, for and with the Holy Spirit or Jesus (T-11.V.1-2). And it is only the mind that chooses to deny and hide or to look and release. Jesus in the Course is always addressing our minds as the decision maker, encouraging us to choose differently--against the ego. Nevertheless, there are some sections and passages that perhaps make this important aspect of the Course's teaching even clearer, and here are a few of them: Very early in the Course, in the section \"This Need Not Be\" (T-4.IV.1-8), Jesus tells us that our state of mind-- our attitudes, our feelings, and our behavior--reflect a choice we are making. And we can recognize that we are choosing the ego whenever we are not joyous, when we are sad, depressed, anxious, guilty. And yet, Jesus reassures us, for each ego feeling, this need not be, if we are vigilant in watching our mind \"for the temptations of the ego\" (T-4.IV.6:1). For our mind joined with Jesus' mind can shine the ego away. The prayer in the closing paragraph of Chapter 5 makes this same point very clearly again (T-5.VII.6). In \"Looking Within\" (T-12.VII.5-15), Jesus further elaborates on the nature of the choice we are always making within our own minds that determines how we see the world and seem to be affected by it. He also addresses the fear that looking within arouses within us because of the guilt we believe is there. Later in the text, in \"The Responsibility for Sight\" (T-21.II), Jesus again emphasizes the power of our minds in determining what we see and experience. Although at a deeper metaphysical level, Jesus is telling us that our own thoughts are literally the cause of everything we see, at a more practical, day-to-day level, we can understand this section as helping us to see that it is our choice how to see or interpret events in our world that determines our reactions to the events, and not the events themselves (T-21.in.1). In \"The Dreamer of the Dream\" (T-27.VII), Jesus first describes how we see ourselves as innocent victims of the world. He then shows us that we can escape our suffering simply by looking upon the problem as it is--a choice we have made in our own mind for sin and guilt-- and not as we have set it up, so that it appears that we are not a mind but a body at the mercy of a world outside itself. Towards the end of the section, Jesus asserts, \"You are the dreamer of the world of dreams. No other cause it has, nor ever will\" (T-27.VII.13:1-2). He is encouraging us to understand that our perceptions of victimization are a deliberate attempt to see ourselves as a body rather than a mind, so that the decision in our mind behind our experiences remains forever obscure and therefore beyond examination or change. The subsequent section, \"The 'Hero' of the Dream\" (T-27.VIII), further elaborates on this self-imposed, self-deceiving ruse, while disclosing that \"the secret of salvation is but this: that you are doing this unto yourself\" (T- 27.VIII.10:1). This invitation to look honestly at what we are really up to with our ego requires often painful self-observation of our own internalized guilt, which we wish to see in everyone and everything but ourselves. \"Dream Roles\" (T-29.IV) continues with the helpful metaphor of the dream, asking us to look at how our anger at others always reflects our judgment that they have failed to fulfill the role we have assigned them in our dreams--meeting our own needs. And yet, at a deeper level, they have fulfilled the role we have given them, for they are now clearly the \"cause\" of our pain and unhappiness, rather than any choice we have made within our own mind for sin and guilt. The ego's existence is thereby safeguarded. Again, the honest self-examination that recognizing these motivations within ourselves requires can be very painful, especially as we first begin to uncover them. Near the end of the text, \"The Savior's Vision\" (T-31.VII) asks us to look at the concepts we have made of both ourselves and of our brothers, including our belief that we are bodies that can hurt and be hurt and die. As we become willing to see that we and our brothers are the same and not different, we will no longer be invested in seeing ourselves as good and others as bad, attempting to purchase our own innocence at the cost of everyone else's guilt. And the buried concept of a sinful and evil self that we hold of ourselves can then be exchanged for a self concept of gentleness and forgiveness, as we give the guilty self concept, which we have made on our own, to One Who is not deceived by the ego's lies."

    "text_input": "Q #651: One of the most prominent ways my ego defends itself against the Love of God is through obsessing about past relationships. As I've continued to study A Course in Miracles and viewed this situation as my specific forgiveness classroom, the viciousness of the ego thought system has increasingly come to light. While jogging yesterday, I had a visceral image of attacking and killing my ex-girlfriend, feeling that \"she betrayed me\" by moving on to another relationship and, therefore, will never give me what I want--my innocence, which I believe she stole from me. I recognize that the thoughts about this relationship are a reflection of the  ontological moment when I thought I killed God for what he would not give me. That being said, the intensity of the thought system still terrifies me.  I've looked at Question #377, which provides an outline of how I should practice forgiveness in the relationship. Would you comment on the dynamics of this special relationship and my fear of looking at it in terms of the metaphysics of the Course, and thereby how this relates to my relationship with God? Do you have any readings that specifically address the dynamics of special relationships you think would be helpful?",
    "output": "It no doubt can be unsettling, but nevertheless very helpful, to get in touch with the thought of murder at the foundation of every special relationship (T-23.IV.1:10-11). The thought is not so apparent in the earlier stages of the special love relationship when we believe we are getting what we want. But when our needs change, or our partners no longer seem to be interested in meeting our needs in order to have their own needs met in return, our \"true\" feelings can surface from the darker recesses of our mind. They have always been there, covered over with a facade of special \"love\" and \"concern\" and \"care,\" as we want to hold on to the relationship, using the specialness in order to keep a lid on our own feelings of guilt and unworthiness (T-16.IV.3-4). What a burden of responsibility we place on our special love partners, to keep the vicious hounds of guilt at bay! Eventually, they have to fail us in some way, and then we get what our ego really wants--our relationship partner becomes a victimizer whom we can now hold responsible for our pain and fear (T-16.V.1). You've conveniently assigned your current ex-girlfriend that role for the present moment. As long as we continue under the direction of the ego, there will always be others to give the part of cruel betrayer, deserving only of death! The hope is that, once we begin to recognize the ego-reinforcing pattern of our relationships and the painful consequences to ourselves, we will be open to accepting a different Director for our relationships, Who will assign a different role to both ourselves and our partners, other than victim and victimizer (T- 27.I). It is not necessary to get in touch specifically with that thought of murderous assault on God for not giving us what we want, choosing then to seize it from Him and destroying Him in the process, which is the foundation of the ego's thought system. Our brothers and sisters are more than satisfactory stand-ins for experiencing the same underlying content, which is all that matters. The rest is merely differences in symbols and our concern is only with the underlying source of those symbols--the belief in sin and guilt. Our special relationships with each other were made to reflect the same dynamic as that original special relationship, but in a seemingly more manageable form. For the outcome, according to the ego's story line, of our seeming attack on God is not His final demise but rather His return from the dead, hell-bent on retribution for our sinful choice against Him. The terror associated with that is overwhelming. And so the world and all of our relationships here are the defense against that terror. The defense includes holding others responsible for our pain and loss and fear, rather than looking within our own minds to uncover the choice we believe we made against love. When we understand the underlying content that the special relationship is intended to defend against, it is not at all surprising that the resistance to looking honestly will be great. And that is why we do not want to look by ourselves alone but to remember to invite Jesus to be a part of the looking process with us. In fact, we really want to be able to look through his eyes or we will scare ourselves unnecessarily. If we attempt the undoing process on our own, we will believe there actually is something terrible--the ego and its thoughts of attack and murder--to be undone. Jesus knows better, not confusing illusion with truth, and that is why the looking process with him is so gentle. But we do first want to look at what we believe about ourselves so that, with Jesus, we can make a different choice about who we really are (T-11.V.1-4). Some sections in the Course on special relationships, especially relevant to the issues you raise, include \"The Illusion and the Reality of Love\" (T-16.IV), \"The Choice for Completion\" (T- 16.V), \"Shadows of the Past\" (T-17.III), \"The Christ in You\" (T-24.V), and \"The Picture of Crucifixion\" (T-27.I). These are not the easiest sections in the Course to read and personally reflect on so, again, be sure to invite Jesus to be a part of your reviewing process. See also #71, #108, #213, #471."

    "text_input": "Q #652: From my study, I have come to learn that we must look within, at our thoughts. I have also come to learn that what we see as external is really a projection of what was first internal, and that our brothers can be seen as mirrors of ourselves. Is it necessary that we analyze the thoughts or do we just surrender them? For example, if I am envious of another, do I just look at the thought and \"hand it over,\" or do I question it? E.g., Why am I envious? What is this a projection of? What does envy really mean? Have I given this to \"someone\" else because I feel unworthy? And so on.",
    "output": "A Course in Miracles does not ask that we analyze our thoughts (See: T-15.X.5), but that we look at them carefully and question them. They show us the specific ways we are defending the ego's choice for separation, and are choosing purposefully to make the world and the body real in our awareness. Looking at them honestly, therefore, provides us with very important information about the beliefs we hold about ourselves, others, and most importantly, God. Since one of the ego's most effective dynamics is denial, being willing to look at its thought system is an important part of its undoing. That is why we are asked in the text to: \"Bring ... all [our] dark and secret thoughts to [the Holy Spirit], and look upon them with Him. He holds the light, and you the darkness. They cannot coexist when both of You together look on them\" (T-14.VII.6:8- 10). Looking with the Holy Spirit means looking beyond the thought to the purpose it serves. Hiding behind each thought is a decision to identify with the ego. Our thoughts show us everything the Course tells us about the ego's strategy: its dynamics, its goals, its \"laws,\" and its painful effects. The questions you pose to yourself in the example of being envious are precisely what we are asked to do: \"To learn this course requires willingness to question every value that you hold. Not one can be kept hidden and obscure but it will jeopardize your learning. No belief is neutral\" (T- 24.in.2:1-3). Again, the important thing is to look and question with the Holy Spirit, which means looking with willingness to have the thoughts and judgments healed, rather than to prove that you are a miserable sinner. As the early workbook lessons tell us, our thoughts do not mean anything in themselves (W-pI.10). It is the importance we give to them by judging them as sinful and keeping them hidden which gives them power over us. In reality they have none. As you look closely at your judgments and feelings, such as envy, you will see the hidden beliefs you hold about yourself as unworthy of God's Love. Every judgment projected on to others has its source in the deeply felt unworthiness that follows this mistaken judgment of ourselves. As we look, the revelations can be surprising and often painful, but until we are willing to look at every obstacle we have interposed between ourselves and God's Love so they can be healed, we will not see the truth about ourselves nor our brothers. It is important to remember that Jesus invites us to proceed gently in this process: \"We are ready to look more closely at the ego's thought system because together we have the lamp that will dispel it, and since you realize you do not want it, you must be ready. Let us be very calm in doing this, for we are merely looking honestly for truth\" (T-11.V.1:3-4, italics ours)."

    "text_input": "Q #653: I live in the ego world and I know there is an internal light within that connects me to God. Yet in this ego world I always choose to listen to the ego from which there is no escape using the ways of the ego world. How did I ever find the light and how did A Course in Miracles come into my consciousness if my thoughts are always edited by the ego?",
    "output": "The Course could not have come into your life if you had not chosen against the ego. There is no other explanation. The part of your mind that is aware that you have chosen the ego is the decision-making part, which, as you know, can also choose to listen to the Voice in your right mind that reminds you that this world is not your home. It is unlikely that you have never had a truly loving thought, wouldn't you agree? Jesus assures us that we are not totally insane, which means we always have access to the sane part of our minds. The problem is that, because of the dynamics of denial and projection, we have no direct awareness of what is going on in our minds, and therefore we have to reason backwards, as it were. For example, \"I must have decided wrongly, because I am not at peace\" (T-5.VII.6:7). We are not aware of deciding wrongly, but Jesus is saying that that is the only reason we are not at peace, and, as that series of important statements continues, he teaches that we can \"decide otherwise,\" and that feeling guilty because of the wrong decision is not justified. Thus, the fact that the Course is in your life means that, in one instant at least, you \"decided otherwise.\" You must have been willing to listen to the Voice of Love in your mind, however surrounded by shadows that willingness may have been (T-18.IV.2). The internal light is always there, as you state, for there is a limit on our ability to miscreate (T-2.III.3:3), which means the ego can never entirely drown out that Voice of Love in our minds. The clarity will come as you trust the process more and more. The key is to remember that you always have a choice. That is Jesus' plea in the closing pages of the text, and his gentle encouragement to Helen Schucman: \"'Choose once again' is still your only hope. Darkness cannot conceal the gifts of God unless you want it so\" (The Gifts of God, p. 117). So you must have decided that you want the light, or the Course would not be helping you."

    "text_input": "Q #654: I recently spent six weeks with a man who describes himself as an enlightened being. I saw in him a vacillation between littleness--the desire for the worldly, power, property and prestige--and grandiosity--he believed his almost constant image-enhancing repetitive words about himself as to what it was like to be enlightened. I have since done some soul-searching about whether I had a responsibility to help the others there see what looked to me like a very effective enlistment activity for building a cult. But possibly I was helpful merely by holding consistently to the view that both he and I are simply equally valuable human beings.  After this adventure, I came upon a prayer of Thomas Merton's that begins \"I cannot know, Father, if I am doing your will.\" My joy is tentative and rests on the possibility that, in just being myself, in being authentic, the consistency of the Holy Spirit has been demonstrated--the truth being the equal value of all of us--and I have done my Father's Will and have been of help. As I look back, I can see that if my ego had become involved at all in trying to help, in a willful way, that my actions would have been more like a misguided attempt at rescuing. I never argued against the magical I saw around me, but simply recognized that people caught up in this type of thought system cannot make sense.",
    "output": "Perhaps one of the most difficult lessons Jesus attempts to teach us in his Course is that he is not at all concerned with our words and actions--or anyone else's--but only with our thoughts (see #637ii for an in-depth discussion of this important issue), and this is where he wants our focus to be as well. It is a wonderful ego device to have us deliberate over whether our action or inaction in any particular situation has been ego-based or guided by the Holy Spirit. Now it does sound as if you deported yourself admirably in difficult and challenging circumstances. A Course in Miracles, however, always invites us to focus on how well we are able to recognize external circumstances as a screen for the projection of any unhealed thoughts of separation and guilt within our own minds--thoughts and feelings of judgment, irritation, annoyance, defensiveness, anger, etc., regardless of whether we act upon them. And one of the measures of whether we have been successful in recognizing and releasing our own ego thoughts is that we will come to a recognition of shared rather than separate interests with all our brothers and sisters, despite all the differences in form. In the end, this means recognizing our equality with each other, not as human beings-- for we are very different from each other in many different ways as human beings, with different talents and skills and limitations--but as minds that are all ensnared in ego illusion, sharing the same need to be released from the pain of belief in separation and to awaken. This is not to make any judgment, one way or another, about the validity of your observations of what you perceived as cult-like activity, or to justify anything that anyone else may have been doing. It is just that Jesus cautions us that \"analyzing the motives of others is hazardous to you\" (T-12.I.1:6) because it is \"never without your own ego involvement. The whole process represents a clear-cut attempt to demonstrate your own ability to understand what you perceive\" (T-12.I.2:1-2). And so the only way we can be certain that we are doing the Father's Will is to be willing to look at our own ego judgments and reactions, bringing them to the healing light of the Holy Spirit, Who can then teach us that there are only calls for love and extensions of love--and that our own reactions are our own calls for love (T-12.I.3,6-8). Recognizing whether a brother is extending love or giving a call for love is not a distinction we can make on our own, for on our own we will only succeed in making separation and differences real. But if we succeed in releasing our own ego blocks, then whatever comes through us will simply be a reflection of the love that is shining within our mind--and everyone else's."

    "text_input": "Q #655: I have discovered that my form of attacking the Sonship is overeating. I felt that I was ready through reducing what I eat to look at the guilt and hopefully reduce the fear of God's Love and not use that particular form of attack any more. What I have found is that it is INCREDIBLY difficult to do this, even though I know exactly what purpose my overeating serves: to attack God's Son and keep God's Love away, or to reinforce separation.  I was hoping you could help me with this process. When I reduce what I eat, there is a very strong feeling of \"hunger\" that overwhelms me. I think at that point I want to turn to the Holy Spirit and \"look\" at the guilt in my mind so that I can see that it is not real. When I do this I am not getting any clear thoughts about how to do this. The strong thought is the hunger and need to eat a bunch of junk so the feeling will go away. What does it mean to \"look at the guilt\"? Do you have any suggestions for how I can get past this block that I have to the awareness of love's presence? What are some of the \"truths\" I can use to help me become less afraid and get past this form of attack?",
    "output": "You've got part of it right, but there's an important aspect of your current approach to food that you may want to reconsider, in light of the teachings of A Course in Miracles. There's nothing wrong with trying to get a guilt-based, addictive behavior, such as overeating--or drinking, or gambling, etc.--under control, and that can sometimes be a very helpful first step. But if that is your primary goal, even if you acknowledge that it is a form or symbol for your attack on the Sonship, you've put the cart before the horse, from the Course's perspective! That puts you in good company, since most students want to try to change their behavior rather than their minds. And this is only a \"natural\" desire, while we are more identified with the body in time and space than with the mind outside of time and space. But it's playing right into the ego's grand design of keeping our attention focused on effect (the body) and relegating cause (the mind) to a secondary role. An alternative approach, which reflects the Course's emphasis on thought rather than behavior, would be to shift your goal from reducing your food intake to merely watching the thoughts that accompany your cravings and your eating binges. We believe the problem is our destructive behavior, but Jesus says that the behavior is only ever a symptom of the underlying destructive thought of guilt in the mind (T-2.VI.3). The behavior helps us recognize that the guilt is there in the mind, but our purpose, believe it or not, is not to change either the behavior or the guilt, but merely to acknowledge the guilt and ask for help in seeing ourselves differently. You see, the overeating in itself is not the attack. The thought that motivates the overeating is the attack--and that thought is not real. And if our goal is to change either, we are saying both the thought and its effect--the overeating--are real. Obviously, since both feel very real to us, we cannot be the ones to undo them. The thought of guilt may be experienced as anxiety, fear, neediness, scarcity, inadequacy, self- loathing, etc. The ego wants us to make the specific interpretation--that we are hungry and craving food and the way to address the problem is to eat. The Course invites us to dissociate the thought from the specific context and recognize that the underlying thought is really a statement we are making about ourselves, that we are empty and missing something inside--the love we unconsciously believe we have thrown away (T-30.III.1-3). And this thought is the source of our guilt. Whether we eat something or not is irrelevant as we allow ourselves to get in touch with the underlying thought, which may bring up both fear and pain. We don't want to minimize this step, but we also don't want to stop with it. And so the Course process of looking with the Holy Spirit or Jesus means that we take what seems very real and powerful to us--our guilt, in whatever form it seems real for us--and look at it with Their gentle, nonjudgmental presence beside us. If we are successful in joining with Their love in this process of looking, we will experience some level of reduction in the intensity of our guilt-based feelings. Our continuing investment in the ego and the self we think we are, which are protected by the guilt, will determine how willing we are to release the guilt in any particular moment. So we do not want to judge ourselves if the feelings do not seem to diminish, but just continue to look as honestly as we can and ask for the help to see ourselves in a different light. For what we believe about ourselves--that we are sinful, guilty, weak, limited creatures--is an ego-based lie. And the presence of Jesus and the Holy Spirit in our minds is proof that it is a lie, for our minds could not be home to Their gentle presence if we were the limited selves we have up until now insisted we are. This process of looking at and releasing our guilt is likely to take time so it is important that we be patient with ourselves. Over time, the need to use food to push away those unpleasant, even terrifying thoughts, may also diminish, and food itself will recede in importance as a focus of concern. A more in-depth discussion of this process and these issues can be found in \"Overeating: A Dialogue\" (published in both a small book and a CD format), which presents a discussion Ken Wapnick held with three students around issues of food addiction and preoccupation with weight."

    "text_input": "Q #656: In one answer you wrote, \"A Course in Miracles teaches us that the body was made to attack and replace our true Identity, and to limit love (T-18.VIII.1).\" If that's the case, what on  earth are we doing here then? That seems like an incredibly cynical view of humanity. If being incarnate means that we are inherently attacking each other, why do we even come here?  While I think the Course has a lot of great points and insights, I think, like all spiritual texts, it can be interpreted so literally that it becomes fundamentalist and basically useless to individual people and where they are in life. For years I have stayed in bad relationships with different people while I tried to see their \"innocence\" and to see our oneness. Recently, I have decided to just stay away from people who hurt me (I no longer care if it's an illusion or not) and I have to say I feel a tremendous amount of power in myself and forgiveness for them. If the Course assumes that we have common sense, it's sadly mistaken. Many of us born into insane, addicted families have no common sense, and for people like me, using texts like this can be dangerous. If Jesus really meant to heal us with this text why didn't he take into account those who literally can not differentiate between joy and pain, guilt and love, let alone realize that the pain is an illusion. For years I honestly thought that guilt was love. How do you explain the Course to someone who believes that?",
    "output": "The Course, like any written teaching, is certainly open to misunderstanding, misinterpretation and misapplication. And since its purpose is to completely reverse, undo, and replace our whole thought system, it is even more likely to be misunderstood--for we all have a strong investment in not understanding it. Its passages are all too easily taken out of context if we do not understand the teaching as a whole, which will be most students' experience as they begin to study the Course and attempt to put its principles into practice. And while the Course says nothing about common sense specifically, it is clear that Jesus does not overestimate our ability to understand and make sense of our experiences (T-18.IV.7:5-6; 8:1), for he repeatedly describes us as insane (e.g., T-4.III.10:3-4; T-10.V.10:4, T-13.in.1:7; T-14.I.2:6-7; T-14.XI.2:2; W-pI.53)! He knows and describes in great detail the confusion we all share between pain and joy (e.g., T- 7.X), imprisonment and freedom (T-8.II), and guilt and love (e.g., T-15.V.2-5; T-15.VII.2,7-10; T-15.X.5-6; T-15.XI.4; T-16.IV.3). And he knows his challenge as our teacher is to help us recognize our own confusion--he is very aware that we have great resistance to accepting the truth of what he says (e.g., T-7.X.3-5; W-pI.44.5; M-5.II.1). One of the more common mistakes students make with the Course is thinking that it is advising them how to act and behave. And so your belief that the Course is asking you to remain in abusive relationships and see the other's innocence and your oneness with them is, unfortunately, one of the more common misinterpretations of its teachings. Jesus' primary goal is to help us look at our own ego thoughts, and our relationships are merely the means for helping us identify those thoughts, which we can do whether we physically remain in the relationship with another or not. The relationship in the mind goes on regardless, and that's where Jesus wants us to focus. The Course's teachings on the ego's purpose for making the world and the body, central to understanding what it means by forgiveness, are, as you remark, quite challenging and uncompromising. And yet the Course also offers us another purpose for our \"coming here.\" With the Holy Spirit as our Teacher, the world and our bodies can become the classroom in which we learn our lessons of forgiveness, in the context of all of our special relationships, so that what we made to harm can now be used by the Holy Spirit to heal (T-25.VI.4:1). Nevertheless, not everyone will be drawn to this particular expression of \"the universal course\"--it is but one path among many thousands (M-1.4:1-2). And if you can not accept the Course's teachings on this pivotal point, rest assured there will be another path to lead you back home that you may experience as a gentler road to travel. That is a decision each of us can make only with our own internal Teacher, Who knows what we each truly need to heal the thought of separation and pain in our minds. So please, be gentle with yourself. The last thing Jesus is intending for any of us is to reinforce our pain and guilt. His goal is only to help us make the choice, in a form that we can find most comforting, that will truly alleviate our pain."

I get headaches, depression, all sorts of signs of extreme tension. How do I go from the ego to the Holy Spirit? How can I more easily experience these times of choosing the ego?",
    "output": "At the beginning of Chapter 18 in A Course in Miracles, Jesus talks about our mistake of choosing to be separate from God, and how the world became the screen on which we projected that mistake (T-18.I.6). He tells us that truth remains within our minds \"in quiet\" and is not part of \"the mad projection by which this world was made.\" Then he tells us how to respond to the insanity of the ego world: \"Call it not sin but madness, for such it was and so it still remains. Invest it not with guilt, for guilt implies it was accomplished in reality. And above all, be not afraid of it.\" That is how you can make the process easier for yourself. Whenever you become aware that you have chosen the ego, try to remember Jesus' advice: \"Be not afraid of it.\" Try to be nonchalant about it: \"Oh, there you are again.\" The only power the ego has is what we give it. That is what Jesus is trying to get across to us, and obviously by being afraid of it or fighting against it we are acting as if it had tremendous power over us. Then just be patient. Let the process take as long as it needs, and know that the seeming passage of time has no effect on Jesus' caring love for you. Jesus knows the ego is nothing, and by your being nonchalant about its appearances, you will be joining with him above the ego's battleground. Over a period of time then it will have less and less an effect on you. Finally, if the physical/emotional symptoms persist, it would be a good idea to have them checked out by a doctor or therapist. Combining attention to your body with attention to the thought system in your mind is the most effective way of practicing the gentle message of this Course as we make our way up the ladder of healing."

    "text_input": "Q #658: I have a sibling whom I loved dearly for many years and considered the epitome of truth and honesty. Now that we live near each other and I see her often, the pedestal I kept her on for so many years has been steadily eroding. Mostly, her demeaning attitude towards our elderly father often sends me into a blind rage. Knowing what I know now about projection, perception, forgiveness and so on, I've been trying to see it differently. To my surprise and dismay, the negative feelings became even worse. Can you tell me why?",
    "output": "If you try to \"see it differently\" when you are in a rage, you are fighting against yourself, and that is never helpful. It is far more helpful to just watch yourself being angry or not being able to let go of your negative feelings, and then not judge yourself. It is part of the healing process to become aware of the part of you that does not want to see it differently. One way of defining right-mindedness is: looking at wrong-mindedness without judgment. That in fact is the first stage of learning to \"see it differently,\" which many students tend to skip because they think that hatred is sinful and they therefore want to get rid of it right away. Looking at the hatred without judgment, and then realizing that you cannot hate and be at peace at the same time is what will eventually spark the shift. So when you ask for help to see the situation differently, all of that comes into play. Patience and gentleness with yourself is extremely important. Specialness has deep roots, and it takes a while to work through all the layers to the love underneath. Special love (the pedestal) is deceptive, we are taught in A Course in Miracles, because it always conceals hatred. That is why it is harder to work with than the more up-front, blatant special hate relationship. If you had your sister on a pedestal, you must have been feeling separate from her the whole time; and, given the ego dynamics involved in comparisons, you must also have been secretly accusing her of having stolen her saintliness from you! These are not conscious dynamics, but they help explain the worsening of your negative feelings, because the hatred that was hidden inside the pedestal of special love has been exposed now that the pedestal has been shattered. \"In looking at the special relationship, it is necessary at first to realize that it involves a great amount of pain. Anxiety, despair, guilt and attack all enter into it, broken into by periods in which they seem to be gone\" (T-16.V.1:1-2). It is not unusual at all for things to get worse before they get better when specialness is involved, as special love is a defense, and a defense is needed only if there is fear--intense fear! So when the defense of special love is threatened, you would have to feel tremendously threatened because a crucial layer of self-protection has been weakened, if not destroyed. Until you realize that you do not need a defense at all, you will react to the threat, which results in increased agitation--the attack-defense-attack cycle. Perhaps, too, realizing that the saintliness of your sister is not the truth about her (in your mind) is reminding you of the same thing about yourself. This would intensify your anger toward her. The first half of \"The Two Pictures\" section in the text (T-17.IV) describes the purpose of special relationships in relation to our determination to keep ourselves separate from God; it is particularly clear about our need for special relationships as a means of self-preservation."

    "text_input": "Q #659: A Course in Miracles is a self-study course by its own definition. What would be your view about Course-based psychotherapy?",
    "output": "Although the Course has been written as a self-study course, there would be nothing in its teachings that would preclude seeking out therapy for help along the way. Every relationship provides the opportunity to practice forgiveness and the therapist-patient relationship is no exception. Now it is true that nearly all the world's forms of psychotherapy are concerned only with helping us make better ego-based adjustments to our life circumstances (P-2.in.I). And some may reinforce the belief in the dynamic of victim and victimizer, as experiences of abuse from the past may be uncovered or focused on. Nevertheless, therapy with a non-judgmental, accepting therapist can provide a useful context for identifying ego patterns and feelings that may be difficult to recognize on one's own. That Jesus is not opposed to psychotherapy as a supplement and support for his teachings is apparent from the pamphlet, Psychotherapy: Purpose, Process, and Practice, scribed by Helen Schucman from Jesus in a manner similar to how she took down the Course. However, a study of the pamphlet also makes it clear that, as a form of therapy, there is really no such thing as Course-based therapy. Jesus' focus is only on the thoughts and attitudes in the mind of the therapist in relationship to the patient. He never makes any specific suggestions or recommendations about what the therapist should say or do with the patient--that is not his concern for that is not what brings about true healing. Healing only occurs when the therapist releases every judgment being held about the patient, recognizing that the two of them are really the same, walking together on the same path back home, with the same problem and the same need, to release the insane belief in the reality of separation. For more extensive discussion of these issues, please look at #45 and #102."

    "text_input": "Q #660: I have this ongoing pattern in my life that I was hoping you could comment on. If you asked two different friends to define their relationship in separate rooms they would probably describe the relationship the same way--\"We are good friends or acquaintances, etc.\" But I have this pattern of seeing my relationships with other people differently from how they do. It seems that I think that I am better friends with people than they see me to them. Can you comment on this?",
    "output": "Without knowing more about how you experience these differences between yourself and others in perceiving your relationships, we can only offer you some general points to consider. From the Course's perspective, the only question we need ask of anything is, \"What is it for?\" (T-24.VII.6:1-3). So for the pattern you have identified, you need only ask yourself what purpose it is serving in your life. And to answer that, you will want to look honestly at how these differences between yourself and others in valuing the relationships seem to make you feel. Now if you don't have much reaction one way or another, then you can just chalk it up as further support for the ego's first law of chaos, \"that the truth is different for everyone\" (T-23.II.2:1). In this world of differences we all see through our own special set of filters and so differences in perception are inevitable and unavoidable. However, since the pattern has gained your attention sufficiently that you are inquiring about its significance, it seems more likely that you are having some reaction to the difference. We can suggest a few possible reactions and their implications, but you will have to decide for yourself what is going on for you. You may feel disappointed, perhaps even taken advantage of, that your feelings are not being returned. Jesus speaks of the \"'laws' of friendship, of 'good' relationships and reciprocity\" (W- pI.76.8:3) that we believe must be obeyed, which are all part of the ego's deliberate plan to keep us looking outside ourselves to have our needs met and find happiness through our special love bargains (e.g., T-7.I.4, T-21.III.1). And these rules also allow us to gather the ammunition we need to demonstrate that we are victims of others' lack of appreciation and care and concern. Of course, these defenses are merely the smokescreens that keep us from looking within ourselves to the guilt that is the real cause of all of our feelings of unhappiness and lack. Or perhaps you feel that you are just not good enough and that, despite your best efforts, others will simply not be interested in getting to know you better. This may seem to be a step closer to acknowledging the guilt within yourself than the previous reaction, which blames the other. But so long as we are still harboring blame against anyone, including ourselves, Jesus tells us (T- 11.IV.4-5), we are still trapped in the throes of the ego thought system. For it is not the self in the world that we each believe we are that is the problem, but the mind that thinks it needs this self as a defense against the guilt it is holding onto. On the other hand, you could perhaps feel a certain sense of superiority because you are more open to experiencing intimacy and are not afraid of getting more involved and caring more deeply about others than they do towards you. If this is your reaction, it would be helpful to acknowledge the specialness that necessarily underlies this feeling. And then to recognize that this too is a defense against the guilt in your own mind for choosing against the loving Intimacy that we have all turned away from when we sought to be on our own, independent and autonomous, not needing Anyone else. For we always accuse others of what we have first accused ourselves (T-31.III.1-2). Now there may be other reactions you are having to this pattern in your relationships, but perhaps it is clear from the three examples just described that the path will always bring us back to our own guilt, if we're willing to take it where it leads. And while the ego purpose for all of our relationships is to reinforce unconsciously our own guilt while trying to see it outside of ourselves, our relationships can all be given another purpose when we are willing to recognize them as the vehicles for getting in touch with our belief in our own guilt. For it is only when we can acknowledge that guilt within our own mind that we can make a different choice about it, with the Holy Spirit or Jesus as our Guide for looking rather than the ego. For further discussion on issues related to reciprocity in relationships, see #66 and #398."

    "text_input": "Q #661: Could you please comment on the recent tsunami in Southeast Asia? As a Course student, how should I view it?",
    "output": "The short answer is, with the Holy Spirit. But let's explore what that means. A Course in Miracles teaches us that everything we go through is something we have scripted. If life is our dream and we are the dreamer, then it is our mind that has chosen what to dream about. Shared events like a tsunami are ones that collectively we have chosen to experience. In terms of why something happens, or where it comes from, we don't need to go any further than that. It isn't the dream figure, or individual self we're identified with that made the choice. So we don't need to feel personally responsible (in fact, doing so would only serve the ego's purpose of reinforcing our guilt). What we do need to do is use our reaction to an event such as this to help us awaken and return to the part of our mind that can make a different choice. Remember that the entire purpose of the Course is to remind us that we can change teachers and change thought systems. We can shift our focus from the voice of the ego (that tells us the world is real and we are its victim) to the Voice of the Holy Spirit (that tells us this is all made up and we are still at home in the safety of God's Love). Once you know that's true, you can say, as Jesus does in the Course \"There is no order of difficulty in miracles. One is not 'harder' or 'bigger' than another\" (T-1.I.1:1-2). Jesus can make a statement like that because he is coming from outside of time and space--from outside the dream in which all the events of the world seem to be happening. So from his perspective, a tsunami, a war, or a holocaust is no more important or serious than a schoolyard fight, an unkind thought, or a stubbed toe. To him, they are all the same. Of course, for us (who think we're bodies) to pretend we share his perspective would be ludicrous. But what we can do is realize that, on the level of the mind, the process of dealing with any of these situations (in other words, getting to the point where we can experience the miracle--the change from the ego's view to the Holy Spirit's) is the same. As Course students, in whatever situation we're confronted with, we need to ask Jesus or the Holy Spirit to help us honestly look at all the thoughts and feelings we're experiencing. That means observing our own reactions in the nonjudgmental light of compassion that recognizes our underlying guilt and fear. The world is truly a blank screen onto which we project everything we don't want to see in ourselves. So looking at our reactions to the events of our lives and the world is the only way to take back our projections and eventually see that they are simply covers obscuring God's Love in our mind. From that perspective, a dramatic event such as the recent tsunami offers us an excellent opportunity. Virtually anyone learning of an event that has claimed over 150,000 lives would have a strong reaction. Generally our reactions will be some sort of affirmation of the belief that we are victims. Perhaps (despite being Course students) we wonder if this catastrophic event is punishment from God. Maybe it scares us to be reminded that we live in an unpredictable world in which our body, or the bodies of loved ones could be struck down at any moment. We might feel guilty that others are suffering and dying while we remain physically unaffected. Or possibly we feel angered by the thought that more should have been done before or after the event to help its victims. But when we take the Holy Spirit's Hand and truly look, we'll see that, tragic as this event was on the level of form, ultimately what it's bringing up is simply a variation of what we feel about everything--again, an affirmation that we are bodies being victimized by external sources. The Holy Spirit's Voice will teach us that the exact opposite is true; that external sources cannot hurt us because, regardless of what happens in our personal or collective worlds, nothing can take the peace of God away from us. Once we've really learned that lesson, our thoughts, words, and actions will automatically reflect the love it inspires. Then in any situation, we'll know how to respond lovingly to our brothers-- whether they look like victims or villains, and whether they're half a world away in an actual tsunami, or standing right in front of us."

    "text_input": "Q #662: Would you comment on the idea \"all thinking produces form on some level\" (T- 2.VI.9:14)? Maybe give a couple of examples and how it may relate to working with A Course in Miracles.",
    "output": "The meaning of this important statement is that thinking and its effects are simultaneous, as Jesus repeats in Lesson 19: \"Thinking and its results are really simultaneous, for cause and effect are never separate\" (W-pI.19.1:4). As the preceding sentences in the paragraph indicate, Jesus was trying to teach Helen, and all of us, that we deal with our fear of our mind's power by believing that we can have \"ineffectual\" or \"idle\" thoughts. So Jesus is correcting that by saying that all our thoughts have effects. He emphasizes this same teaching in Lessons 16 and 17 in the workbook. Most of us are accustomed to thinking that our thoughts have no effect if we do not share them or act on them. That is because we do not believe we are minds, or if we do believe we are minds, we believe the mind is in the body and so if the body does not act on a thought, the thought has had no effect. Jesus is saying that our thoughts always have effects. A thought of hatred, for example, even if kept totally \"private,\" has an effect in the mind of the person who has the thought, because it is a thought of separation and that thought banishes peace because it banishes the truth. This does not mean, however, that if you have thoughts of anger toward someone and that person has a heart attack that your thoughts caused the heart attack. No one can choose for another, as Jesus explains in Lesson 152, \"The power of decision is my own\" (W- pI.152). Taken on the metaphysical level, the statement means that every thought is expressed in the dream in terms of a \"script,\" analogous to a video library, where the expression of each thought would be represented by a video. Portions of Lessons 158 and 169 refer to this notion of \"script\" (W-pI.158,169). Our book A Vast Illusion: Time According to A Course in Miracles also discusses in detail these as well as other aspects of time found in the Course."

  {
    "text_input": "Q #663: I would like some clarification on the decision maker. Is there one for each of us or is there just one? Can I contact the decision maker through my thoughts? What will happen to the decision maker once I (we) am (are) healed?",
    "output": "Before answering your specific questions, it is important to understand that when we say anything about the split mind, we are talking about illusion And that means we are operating within the symbols of the ego thought system of separation and duality. And while we can not avoid using symbols in our present state of mind, we do have a choice about the purpose they will serve--they can be used either to maintain and reinforce our belief in separation and guilt or to lead us beyond that belief. In A Course in Miracles, Jesus tells us that, in the whole Mind in Heaven, our only function as God's Son, the Christ, is to create, or extend, the Love that we are (T-9.III.8:4). But once we seemed to entertain the thought of differences and separation, we forgot our function or power to create (T-7.IX.3), replacing it instead with the power to choose (T-12.VII.9:1). And the choice is simply whether to continue to listen to the ego, the voice for maintaining the separation, or to the Holy Spirit, the Voice for healing the separation. This basic power of the split mind to choose between these two alternatives is what, for ease of discussion, we have referred to in our teaching at the Foundation as the \"decision maker.\" In other words, there is no separate entity that exists that is the decision maker--it is the fundamental power or function of our own mind in its seemingly separated state, where differences and alternatives seem real and therefore choice between the alternatives seems real as well. The decision maker, as such, is an illusory symbol, but it can be a helpful one to use in our process of undoing the thought of separation, serving as a powerful alternative identity to the victimized self the ego holds out to us. It is not in the best interests of the ego that we remember that basic function of the split mind to choose, for it makes the ego very vulnerable to the power of our mind to make a simple choice against it. And so the ego has concocted a complex list of other imagined powers and functions to distract us with, and a world and a body to become identified with, so that we forget our initial choice for the ego and separation, no longer remembering that it was our mind's own choice that has brought us to our current condition and circumstances in the world. The Course's primary purpose is to help us remember that one basic function of the split mind-- to choose (T-31.VIII). But to understand what this basic choice is all about, we need to learn that all the seemingly different choices we make and functions we have in the world are nothing more than different forms of the same one choice for the ego (T-31.IV). We don't believe that yet, believing instead that that the choices we make here in the world will make a difference in whether we are happy or not. So we have not really forgotten the power of our mind to choose, but we have forgotten the only real choice in the split mind--the Holy Spirit and His function of forgiveness. Now part of the ego's diversionary tactic to distract us from this single, unitary choice is the seeming fragmentation of the split mind into all the billions of seemingly separate individual minds, each with its own body and identity. But all the fragments remain a part of the one split mind, which never loses its power to choose between the ego and the Holy Spirit. And so returning now to your questions: Each of us maintains our own capacity to choose while we each continue to think that we exist separate from one another, although we share that same function to choose as part of the one mind. In that sense, we each have our own separate decision maker. The decision maker is not a separate entity to be contacted, but a function each of us needs to remember. And it's not really that we need to remember that our minds have the power to choose. We need to remember what the only real choice is about, which we recall in any moment when we recognize our ego and know that we are not our ego. When we have released all of our fear over losing our ego identity and have made the choice, once and for all, for the Holy Spirit, we will no longer need the power to choose, for we will know with certainty that only one of the alternatives is real. We will be just one step away from Heaven and return to our one true function as God's Son--sharing in creating. And so with nothing to choose between, the power of choice will disappear and the decision maker will no longer seem to exist, its function and purpose completed."

    "text_input": "Q #664: I know that the goal of A Course in Miracles is to realize that all the world we see is an illusion and to eventually give up our ego to be in the reality of union with God. My question is has anyone ever reached the goal and actually done it? If so how did they describe the experience? Are there signposts along the way that the illusion is nearly dismissed or have I missed the point and there is another goal?",
    "output": "Your question is a version of the \"famous question\" of how the separation could have ever happened if we were happy and at peace in God. It implies that the separation is real and the question can then only be answered in some form that supports this belief. The truth is that we have all \"done it,\" because we have not \"undone it\" (see T-6.II.10:7-8). However, we believe we have accomplished the impossibility of separating from God and are in need of help to learn that we are mistaken. We have chosen to believe the dream of separation and have identified with the ego. This mistake includes identifying with the body, and makes the world real in our experience. We then seem to experience a learning process whereby we gradually accept the Holy Spirit's truth and learn to identify with the part of the mind that holds the memory of God's Love, rather than with the body. It is the healing process of forgiveness that provides glimpses of the Love that has been forgotten, described in the Course as holy instants. Gradually we learn that the peace of the holy instant is preferable to the pain of clinging to the ego, and begin to choose it more frequently and easily, until it is the only thing we choose. That is how the \"goal\" is accomplished. Jesus represents for us one who has chosen to identify only with the Love in his mind, and has thus reached the goal. His \"experience\" is expressed throughout A Course in Miracles, and is, in fact, its source. The important thing to remember is that it is also our experience. As he tells us in the text: \"Believe in the resurrection [the \"goal\"] because it has been accomplished, and it has been accomplished in you. This is as true now as it will ever be ... For we ascend unto the Father together, as it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be, for such is the nature of God's Son as his Father created him\" (T-11.VI.4:6-7,9). The signposts along the way need not be earth-shattering experiences. They are simple moments like the sense of relief when we finally let go of a grievance, or realize that we do not have to be right, letting someone else have the final word. A moment of peace, however fleeting, points the way to the lasting peace we seek. It is important to recognize these little signs, rather than to expect lightening bolts to flash into our lives. Being true glimpses of the final goal, they lead us more surely to its realization. We return always to the practice of the forgiveness the Course teaches as the sure guide to our own awakening. \"The necessary condition for the holy instant does not require that you have no thoughts that are not pure. But it does require that you have none that you would keep\" (T-15.IV.9:1-2). So our goal is only to do our part in looking at all our judgments, which are the blocks that prevent our awareness of God's Love. As the blocks are removed, the truth of our oneness with His Love, which seemed to have been forgotten, will be remembered."

  {
    "text_input": "Q #665: What does A Course in Miracles mean by \"form\" and \"content?\" How does one know that one is experiencing Christ's Love or the Holy Spirit's Answer? I have been working with the Course for 10 years and am a bit frustrated with the lack of progress. I simply cannot think of anyone or anything to forgive. I truly believe I am holy and I \"see\" the illusion in which I dwell.  Yet, Heaven eludes me. Must one die a physical death in order to dwell in the promised Heaven? I am really curious to hear how others are experiencing Love.",
    "output": "The first thing we need to understand about form and content is that they are part of the Son of God's dream, and do not exist in reality. While the Son sleeps he appears to have a mind separate from God's. This mind has only two possible \"contents\" or thoughts: the thought of separation, or the memory of oneness with God. It has only one activity: the power to choose between these two thoughts. Once the mind chooses one of these two thoughts, the thought takes form. The form may be a specific behavior, a \"thought\" or a judgment that expresses the original thought. As the Course tells us early in the text: \"All thinking produces form at some level\" (T- 2.VI.9:14). When the content of the mind is the choice for the Holy Spirit, Who represents the memory of God's Love in the mind, whatever is done or not done in form will be a reflection of that Love. The Love/content is communicated in some form because it has been chosen. If the content of the mind is the choice for separation, it is governed by the ego. Therefore, no matter how sweet and loving the form may appear to be, it will be an attack because it expresses the ego's denial of God. If Heaven eludes us, we are not at peace, and if we are not at peace there is room for forgiveness. As Jesus tells us in the text: \"Whenever you are not wholly joyous, it is because you have reacted with a lack of love to one of God's creations\" (T-5.VII.5:1). The initial \"lack of love\" occurs in the mind when we choose to identify with the ego, rather than with the part of the mind that remembers who we truly are (God's innocent Son). This is what the Course teaches is unloving toward oneself, as well as all our brothers who are God's one Son, and it is what needs to be forgiven. The goal of the Course is to teach us to become aware of the content of our minds so that it can be healed of the thought of separation, and we can make another choice. Meanwhile, because our minds are unhealed, we are not the ones to judge whether we are truly experiencing or expressing the loving content of the Holy Spirit. We also are not qualified to evaluate our progress. When we are discouraged about our progress it is helpful to call to mind the passage at the end of the text: \"I do not know the thing I am, and therefore do not know what I am doing, where I am, or how to look upon the world or on myself\" (T-31.V.17:7). Jesus also tells us \"Some of your greatest advances you have judged as failures, and some of your deepest retreats you have evaluated as success\" (T-18.V.1:6). This may not seem like good news on a \"good\" day when we're having a \"good time,\" but it does free us of the burden of evaluating ourselves. Ultimately it is very good news because we are not the miserable sinners we thought we were. We need not know anything, we need only to be willing to do our part by paying careful attention to any judgments that are not loving, so they can be healed, then \" ... What you are will tell you of Itself\" (T-31.V.17:9) and that will be our final experience. Attachment to our ego is what keeps us from the awareness that we are home with God in Heaven. This block to our awareness is not removed by death, it is undone through healing the thought of separation. Since the Course itself is a reflection of the part of the mind that holds the memory of God's Love, the forgiveness it teaches is also an experience of love: \"Forgiveness [choosing the Holy Spirit] is the healing of the perception of separation. Certain it is that all distress does not appear to be but unforgiveness [choosing separation]. Yet that is the content underneath the form. It is this sameness which makes learning sure, because the lesson is so simple that it cannot be rejected in the end\" (W-pI.193.4:1-3). Though not the final experience, the small glimpses of Love's reflection when we let go of judgments against ourselves and others will lead us to it. As we are promised in the text: \"I am leading you to a new kind of experience that you will become less and less willing to deny\" (T- 11.VI.3:6). We have great resistance to this healing, which is why the study of A Course in Miracles is a lifetime process. Our patient, persistent and gentle practice of forgiveness will lead us home."

    "text_input": "Q #666: After reading some of your answers I've got a picture that there is some mind outside time, space and partly consciousness that creates situations, conditions, even determines place and time of birth, and gets you to particular places and people--all this according to the content of that mind. Is this impression true?",
    "output": "Yes, it is. The mind of the Sonship that has chosen separation is asleep; dreaming of a world where it is in charge, and making all things in this world reflect its choice for separation from God. It is outside of the time and space it fabricates because the mind is thought not form, and cannot \"be outside itself.\" As A Course in Miracles teaches, its thoughts can be projected into form, but do not leave the mind: \"Ideas leave not their source, and their effects but seem to be apart from them. Ideas are of the mind. What is projected out, and seems to be external to the mind, is not outside at all, but an effect of what is in, and has not left its source\" (T-26.VII.4:7- 9). God shares His creative power with His Son who is one with Him, and when the mind chooses separation the son projects the guilt for making this choice, which is a misuse of this power. This projected guilt is the origin of the circumstances of our lives that you refer to. They are effects of the mind's choice to separate. Their purpose is to prove to the mind that it is right in believing that the separation is real and has had real effects. The strategy works, because when we choose separation we do in fact experience ourselves in bodies having all kinds of relationships, and finding ourselves in situations that seem to be out of our control. The immediate specifics that occur, such as plumbing breakdowns or car accidents, are inevitable effects of the mind's choice to identify with the ego thought system. All kinds of breakdowns are built in to this system because it is founded on an important ego rule: \"Seek and do not find\" (T-12.V.7:1). We can be certain that whatever circumstances occur, or whatever experiences we have in the world, they will never satisfy us nor meet our real need. We will not find what we seek; the world will always fail us. We can also be certain that life in the world will always succeed in fulfilling the ego's goal to make us feel victimized by forces beyond our control. Denial is one of the important tricks the mind plays on itself to make its plan work. Once the mind chooses separation it denies that it has made the choice and dissociates itself from its creative power. This does not mean that there is a power external to ourselves that is manipulating events, like the Wizard of Oz behind the curtain. It means that the mind agrees to subject itself to the ego's laws by identifying with the body, thus believing that life begins with birth and ends with death. The laws of God are thereby denied, and an insane reversal of these laws seems to make us victims of things beyond our control. That is precisely what the mind intends for us to believe in order to support its claim that the separation is real. In choosing separation the collective mind of the Sonship has filled the world with accidents and an endless barrage of events. This is not the work of the individual mind. When the individual mind chooses victimization, we can be sure some \"accident\" will happen to \"make us feel victimized.\" This does not mean that we put a truck in our path to hit us, it means we were looking for a truck to hit us, actually hoping one would come along to hit us, to give form to our chosen (and cherished) victimization theme. The limits that time and space impose are \"real\" in our experience of them: the body will in fact die, and we cannot stop the sun from rising. Since we are asleep and believe our dream is real, we are not asked to disbelieve these occurrences, but to question our interpretation of them. We interpret them according to the ego or the Holy Spirit. The ego sees these occurrences as proof that the world is real and we are powerless victims of its whims. The Holy Spirit, Who represents the part of the mind that knows it is a mind, teaches that they prove that we have a mind, with power that can be misused by making a physical world where God can be excluded so we can carry on with our separation scripts. Those are the two possible thoughts/content that the mind chooses between. Although the specific form involved in any situation may be the same, it can be used for the ego's purpose (the separation/world is real) or the Holy Spirit's (separation is impossible/the world is an illusion)."

    "text_input": "Q #667: A Course in Miracles says, \"Heaven is not a place nor a condition. It is merely an awareness of perfect Oneness, and the knowledge that there is nothing else; nothing outside this Oneness, and nothing else within\" (T-18.VI.1:5-6). Regarding this, I read in the book, The Disappearance of the Universe: \"If there is nothing else, then there are no obstacles, and no friction to impede your extension.\" What does that mean? If there is only oneness who are we extending to? Would you talk about extension?",
    "output": "Jesus uses the term extension in two ways. First, he uses it to describe the ongoing process of creation in Heaven, wherein spirit extends itself: God creating Christ. Since Heaven is beyond time and space, extension cannot be understood as a temporal or a spatial process. Therefore, there is no \"from\" and \"to.\" Jesus also uses the term in reference to the Holy Spirit's or Christ's vision being extended in the form of forgiveness or peace. Forgiveness and peace extend naturally, just as love naturally extends itself. Our part in that process has only to do with removing the blocks to that extension; and the blocks are mainly our insistence on seeing our interests as separate from others, rather than the same. Thus we exclude others (in our minds) from the all-inclusive embrace of forgiveness and peace. In this second sense of extension, Jesus is contrasting the Holy Spirit's use of the law of mind with the ego's use, which is always projection. Since ideas leave not their source, what is extended remains in the mind, where it is reflected in the world of illusion. This is difficult for us to understand because we are so identified with our physical experience in a world of time and space that we think is real. Extension is always of the mind and is never between two separate entities."

    "text_input": "Q #669: I have been drawn to dowsing Bach flower remedies, which are said to work energetically, with helpful results for friends, myself, my son, and my cat. I recently had an experience in which the remedies I offered another were perfect for me. And once I had realized this, it seemed then that none of the specific remedies were needed any more by either of us. I felt a rush of gratitude that, while I was dowsing for others, I also was benefiting energetically from the remedies. My sense is that I have glimpsed the difference between the healed healer and the unhealed healer, which now makes a lot of sense. I cannot heal anyone other than myself.  If any further remedy dowsing is to be done by me, rather than my offering my ego-invested services to others, I guess it'll be because someone else has come to me as my healer. That is, so I can gratefully receive the message of whatever remedies come up for them for myself too. Perhaps this explains why two different people dowsing for remedies for a third person could come up with different remedies? It doesn't make dowsing inaccurate--it, along with everything (and everyone!), is simply here as a messenger for/of love. In a word, we are each others' healers, and knowing that helps us to laugh at the ego-concept of ourselves, helps us to recall that there is no threat. Can you comment?",
    "output": "It sounds as if you've had a genuinely helpful experience around healing, coming in the specific context of Bach flower remedies. To clarify further the nature of your experience, it can be helpful to remember that everything (and everyone) is actually a symbol within our mind. And their meaning--as either a messenger of love or a messenger of guilt and fear (T-19.IV- A.i)--depends, not on anything about them, but on which teacher we have chosen to view them with. The healing A Course in Miracles is speaking about happens when we recognize that our interests are the same as our brother's or sister's--we are all looking for a way out of the painful, fearful, guilt-ridden thought system we have been embracing and operating within all of our lives. With that recognition, we will then experience the healing in some specific form that will have a special meaning for us--the Bach flower remedies, for example, in the situation you describe. But again, the specific form is nothing but a symbol of the underlying content in the mind. As you observe, if you were to be identified with your ego, you would see yourself as having a special gift with the Bach flowers that you give to others who are separate and different from you, with their own special needs, different from your own--you would be acting as the unhealed healer (T-7.V.7:1-4, S-3.III). And so the same form or symbol can be used as either an instrument for separating or an instrument for healing, depending on our choice of teachers. And when we recognize that, it becomes clear, as you note, that the specific forms or remedies become secondary, or irrelevant, to the real healing in the mind."

    "text_input": "Q #670: My question is about miracles. Lesson 345 in the workbook of A Course in Miracles says, \"I offer only miracles today, For I would have them be returned to me\" (W-pII.345). When I am offering a miracle, am I offering love and forgiveness? Jesus says, \"Ask me which miracles you should perform. This spares you needless effort ... \" (T-1.III.4:3-4) What does that mean?",
    "output": "Lesson 345, like all the lessons in part II of the workbook, is a beautiful prayer to ourselves to remember the important teachings of the text and first part of the workbook, and to apply them in our lives all through the day. In this specific lesson we are reminded to see everything that happens as an opportunity to have the hateful judgments of the ego transformed to the miracle of forgiveness. The miracle occurs when we remember that nothing external to the mind has any effect. This means that nothing others do or say, nor anything that happens can take our peace away. Our loss of peace is caused only by a choice in the mind to believe the separation is real, instead of joining with the Holy Spirit, Who represents the part of the mind that remembers we are one with our Father. Offering miracles then, means not blaming anyone or anything for the lack of peace we experience, and remembering that it is the effect of the choice we made in the mind. We thus forgive others by releasing them of responsibility for our state of mind and for our experience in the dream. That is how we learn to \" ... forgive the Son of God for what he did not do\" (T-17.III.1:5). We are not asked to deny that others may do hurtful things to us, but we are asked to accept responsibility for the choice in our minds that causes the feelings of hurt and betrayal that seem to come from others' behavior toward us. The recognition that we are responsible for the choice we make in our minds is the most loving thing we can do for ourselves and for others. Acknowledging that everyone has a mind, and that we are all the same in the power we share to choose to listen to the ego's lie of separation or to the Holy Spirit's message that we are one with our Father, is the miracle we offer and receive. When we are willing to practice forgiveness in this way, we invite the Holy Spirit to respond with love through us. It is He Who is in charge of extending love. That is what is meant by the lines you quote (T-1.III.4:3-4). Jesus tells us to ask him for guidance because he, along with the Holy Spirit, represents the part of our minds that remembers our oneness with God. Because we have dissociated ourselves from that part of our minds, it is helpful for us to have a symbol such as Jesus or the Holy Spirit to serve as guides to the right minded perception that does not see the distortions of the ego. Turning to them for guidance reflects our willingness to let go of our judgments and to see as they see, and is the heart of the forgiveness process whereby the blocks of our judgment are removed. Asking which miracles to perform means not deciding on our own how to perceive any situation, nor how to respond to anyone, because we do not know. This requires that we first be willing to see the judgments we make with the ego and then, with willingness to let them go, ask for a new perception. This clears the way for the extension of love, which is effortless because it is natural: \"Learning of Christ is easy, for to perceive with Him involves no strain at all. His perceptions are your natural awareness, and it is only the distortions you introduce that tire you\" (T-11.VI.3:7-8). The only \"effort\" we are asked to put forth is a \"little willingness\" to question our interpretation of our identity and our experiences. It is enough to introduce a slight suspicion that we may be wrong in our belief that we are separate from our Source and from each other: \"Salvation, perfect and complete, asks but a little wish that what is true be true; a little willingness to overlook what is not there; a little sigh that speaks for Heaven as a preference to this world that death and desolation seem to rule\" (T-26.VII.10:1). Each time we make this little effort, our belief in the ego's thought system lessens and our fear of the Holy Spirit's loving perception diminishes. This is the miracle we offer to ourselves and to the entire Sonship."

    "text_input": "Q #671: Ghosts? Prevalent belief in the world, indeed. Consider the parallels--the lost soul, living in a dream world, no physical presence, refusing to realize the death of the body, and not wanting to leave the world they know. It seems like there's something to that idea of ghosts--a widely held belief made up by the ego to explain away our remembering reality and the separation?",
    "output": "One of the more common deceitful tricks of the ego is to take an aspect of its thought system and give it a more circumscribed definition within our experience so that we don't see it as a pervasive part of our \"reality\" under its malevolent reign. And so it requires someone outside of this thought system, or at least not completely identified with it, to see beyond the veils of deception and confusion that have been interposed between this false \"reality\" and our true Identity. So, for example, we seem to experience differentiated states of sleeping and waking, with dreaming apparently an accompaniment of the sleeping state. And so we believe we know the difference between sleeping and waking, and dreams and reality. We never question whether the various states of mind we experience in the world might not be meaningless shifts within a single continuous dream, while we sleep on and on. Because we think there is a difference between our waking state and our dreaming state, we never question our assumption that we know what it is to be awake. But Jesus does (e.g., T-10.I.2-3; T-18.II.5). We also have definitions of insanity and mental illness that apply only to some people, but not to others, believing that we know and experience sanity within this world. And so, because we think we know what insanity is, we never even consider the possibility that all of our thinking here is insane. But Jesus knows otherwise (e.g., T-9.VII.6; T-10.V.10; T-23.II.14). And then we believe we know the difference between life and death, which to us are obviously mutually exclusive states of the body. We know we are alive and we can identify by very objective criteria who is dead. And so we never question whether our entire existence may not be a form of death predicated on the belief that we can separate ourselves from Life. But Jesus can lead us to a different conclusion (e.g., T-23.II.19; W-pI.167). And of course, we think we can tell the difference between love and hate, because we believe we can recognize the forms of each so easily. And so we never question whether what we call love may not simply be a disguised form of hatred. But Jesus is not fooled (e.g., T-16.VII.5; T- 23.II.17; T-23.III.1-2; T-29.I.6-7). And so, yes, ghosts become another distraction of the ego--are they real, is there individual life after death?-- hiding a deeper truth. After all, ghosts, were they to exist, we know would be something other than what we are-- alive and solid and real. And so we never consider whether in fact the self we think we are is nothing but a shadowy ghost of our real Self. And again, Jesus knows otherwise, and he tries to help us see the ghastly nature of this ghostly existence we call life. And so he notes the consequences of our choice for the ego, against our true Self: \"Deny your own Identity, and you will not escape the madness which induced this weird, unnatural and ghostly thought that mocks creation and that laughs at God. Deny your own Identity, and you assail the universe alone, without a friend, a tiny particle of dust against the legions of your enemies. Deny your own Identity, and look on evil, sin and death, and watch despair snatch from your fingers every scrap of hope, leaving you nothing but the wish to die\" (W-pI.191.3, italics added). Yet Jesus does not leave us caught in that ego trap, but recognizing how like small children we are, he reassures us: \"Children perceive frightening ghosts and monsters and dragons, and they are terrified. Yet if they ask someone they trust for the meaning of what they perceive, and are willing to let their own interpretations go in favor of reality, their fear goes with them. When a child is helped to translate his \"ghost\" into a curtain, his \"monster\" into a shadow, and his \"dragon\" into a dream he is no longer afraid, and laughs happily at his own fear. \"You, my child, are afraid of your brothers and of your Father and of yourself. But you are merely deceived in them. Ask what they are of the Teacher of reality, and hearing His answer, you too will laugh at your fears and replace them with peace. For fear lies not in reality, but in the minds of children who do not understand reality. It is only their lack of understanding that frightens them, and when they learn to perceive truly they are not afraid. And because of this they will ask for truth again when they are frightened. It is not the reality of your brothers or your Father or yourself that frightens you. You do not know what they are, and so you perceive them as ghosts and monsters and dragons. Ask what their reality is from the One Who knows it, and He will tell you what they are. For you do not understand them, and because you are deceived by what you see you need reality to dispel your fears. \"Would you not exchange your fears for truth, if the exchange is yours for the asking? For if God is not deceived in you, you can be deceived only in yourself. Yet you can learn the truth about yourself from the Holy Spirit, Who will teach you that, as part of God, deceit in you is impossible\" (T-11.VIII.13-15)."

    "text_input": "Q #672: A Course in Miracles teaches that the Holy Spirit does not speak to us and does not interfere with the things of the world. It teaches that the Holy Spirit does not guide or direct us, but sometimes it feels like I am being guided and directed. Where do hunches and intuition come from? Are these messages of the ego? Are we totally alone here to make our own decisions? When we free ourselves from guilt and judgments are we more open to receive ideas and thoughts that are more loving and more helpful on our journey here on earth? Where do these thoughts come from?",
    "output": "The fact that the Holy Spirit does not intervene in the world does not mean that He is not present in our minds as a Guide and Teacher. The entire Course really is about learning how to correct our original choice to be guided by the ego rather than the Holy Spirit. Unfortunately, we have identified with the ego thought system to such an extent that we no longer experience ourselves as being directed by it, and for the most part never experience the other part of our minds (the Holy Spirit) that contains the memory of what we were and where we came from before we made that foolish choice to hear only the voice that speaks for separation. So Jesus is teaching us throughout the Course that we are always choosing to be guided, and that the guide we have chosen is insane (the ego), but there is another Voice in our minds that we can choose to listen to: the Voice of sanity (the Holy Spirit). Hunches and intuitions therefore can come from either of these two thought systems in our minds. In light of this, you are correct in saying that as we let go of guilt and judgments through the practice of forgiveness, we are more open to the truly loving and helpful thoughts and ideas coming from our right minds. It is so important to remember, though, that we are always choosing to be guided by either the ego or the Holy Spirit. Moreover, the loving and helpful thoughts and ideas inspired by the Holy Spirit are not directed at making our lives in the world work better. Rather, by choosing against the ego, we are removing the interferences to our awareness of love's presence (T-in.1:7), which means that our perception of ourselves and the world will shift from a self-centered/separate interests orientation to one in which there is a growing realization that we all share the same interests, and ultimately the same Identity. It is also true that we would tend to function better in the world--that is, make fewer self-destructive choices--when we are not motivated by the unconscious need to project our guilt and to be special, but that does not necessarily mean we will be more successful in the world (as the world typically views success). Jesus urges us to turn to the Holy Spirit as frequently as we can, not for help to improve our lives in the world, but to be \"absolved of guilt ... [for] following the Holy Spirit's guidance ... is the way out of hell ...\" (M-29.3:3,10-11). We must first realize that our lives in this world are \"hell\" because of our selfish choice to leave our true home and take on a false identity, which has burdened us with unending needs, limitations, and problems. The only meaningful help, consequently, would be what would lead us home and restore to us our true Identity as God created us. Jesus instructs us that \"the Holy Spirit knows the truth about you. The image you made does not ... To ask the Holy Spirit to decide for you is simply to accept your true inheritance\" (M-29.4:6-7; 5:4). Thus, our natural state as we journey home is to be joined with the Holy Spirit, meaning we are never alone. Indeed, thinking that we are on our own and need to make decisions our own is the fundamental error that Jesus is helping us to recognize and correct, as the concluding section of the manual stresses. Unfortunately, because of the many tangled layers of self-deception resulting from our choice to substitute illusion for reality, and then blot that decision from our awareness, it is not readily apparent to us most of the time whether we have chosen the ego or the Holy Spirit as our teacher. In fact, that is the topic of one of the most frequently asked questions since the publication of the Course, and one we have addressed in our book The Most Commonly Asked Questions about A Course in Miracles (#43). In general, it seems that only after a great deal of experience and feedback from trusted friends or family members can we begin to trust our own discernment. \"The Test of Truth\" section in Chapter 14 of the text offers guidelines that will help in this process. Most important is focusing on asking Jesus' or the Holy Spirit's help in setting aside the ego thought system, rather than asking for help with things in the world. By denying the validity of the ego thought system we affirm the truth of the Holy Spirit's thought system of Atonement."

    "text_input": "Q #673: No one has satisfactorily explained the need to sleep and dream. The phenomenon of night dreaming is common and it is the one aspect of our experience that can question the reality of our world. We know the sayings of the Chinese philosopher Chuang Tzu about his dream of being the butterfly. Also, hallucinating is very rare and thought to be abnormal. Did the ego make a mistake? Or on the contrary, are sleeping dreams an intervention of the right mind to give us a hint about the unreality of our world? Or perhaps an expression of compromise between them?",
    "output": "Everything of the body--physical and psychological--is part of the ego's plan and strategy to keep the separation from God real. A Course in Miracles does not explain the bodily phenomena of sleeping dreams and hallucinations; rather it points out their value in teaching us about the power our minds have to distort reality to suit our own purposes. This is the central point in \"The Basis of the Dream\" in Chapter 18 of the text (T-18.II), where Jesus describes some of the characteristics of our dreams; for example: \"Dreams are chaotic because they are governed by your conflicting wishes, and therefore they have no concern with what is true. They are the best example you could have of how perception can be utilized to substitute illusions for truth ... They provide striking examples, both of the ego's inability to tolerate reality, and of your willingness to change reality on its behalf ... Dreams show you that you have the power to make a world as you would have it be, and that because you want it you see it. And while you see it you do not doubt that it is real. Yet here is a world, clearly within your mind, that seems to be outside\" (T-18.II.2:1-2,5; 5:1-3). Since we all can relate to what Jesus is saying about our dreams, he can then use these examples to teach us about the dynamics going on in our minds all the time, but that we are not aware of. Thus while sleeping and dreaming are aspects of the ego's miscreations, they can be used to help us let go of our belief in the ego thought system: \"The Holy Spirit has another use for all the illusions you have made, and therefore He sees another purpose in them. To the Holy Spirit, the world is a place where you learn to forgive yourself what you think of as your sins\" (W- pI.64.2:2-3). The point that Jesus stresses is that there is no difference between our waking dreams and our sleeping dreams; they are different forms of the same dream of separation, and therefore they can be either right-minded expressions or wrong-minded expressions. \"All your time is spent in dreaming. Your sleeping and waking dreams have different forms, and that is all. Their content is the same\" (T-18.II.5:12-14)."

    "text_input": "Q #674: What advice would you have for a teacher of God whose own healing depends on the change of mind of the patient. My mom was given a miracle through me, but it is waiting on her acceptance of it. This miracle will heal me just the same. The healing is not of an illness but rather of a lack of abundance. I feel healed because of revelation, but the continuation of symptoms is hard to ignore at times. I turn to the Holy Spirit as much as I can, and He helps me remember that I have an agreement with God, and that God does not change His Mind. Still, what is my role here? Can I do anything to speed up her change of mind? So far I have simply watched her progress and gave her the word of God when I felt she needed to hear it. Is there anything else I can do?",
    "output": "If we believe that our own healing depends on someone else's change of mind, what we really need is a change of mind ourselves! Your intentions around your mother's accepting the healing seem well-meaning enough, but Jesus cautions, \"Trust not your good intentions. They are not enough (T-18.IV.2:1-2). For while you remain concerned about her acceptance of the miracle, or feel a need to help her progress in her acceptance of it, your mind is also not accepting it! Hard as this may be to believe, Jesus makes this point in the most uncompromising terms, in the section \"Should Healing Be Repeated?\" in the manual for teachers: \"One of the most difficult temptations to recognize is that to doubt a healing because of the appearance of continuing symptoms is a mistake in the form of lack of trust. As such it is an attack. Usually it seems to be just the opposite. It does appear unreasonable at first to be told that continued concern is attack. It has all the appearances of love. Yet love without trust is impossible, and doubt and trust cannot coexist. And hate must be the opposite of love, regardless of the form it takes. Doubt not the gift and it is impossible to doubt its result. This is the certainty that gives God's teachers the power to be miracle workers, for they have put their trust in Him\" (M-7.4). Specifically, what does it mean that her symptoms are hard for you to ignore at times? Her continued symptoms are reminding you, at least unconsciously, of unhealed places within your own mind, and that is where Jesus would ask you to direct your attention, rather than to your mother's continuing resistance. For if we are affected by someone else's inability to accept a miracle, we are making the error of their thinking real in our own mind, believing that the ego is a real problem rather than merely a mistaken perspective based on an illusory belief in separation. Believing the ego is real is the only problem we need to address. And while we believe that someone else is in any way responsible for our lack of peace, we are missing the opportunity to heal our own misperception. For if we could really be affected by another's choice, then we could be victimized by forces beyond our control. Yet Jesus makes it very clear, early in the workbook, that we are not victims of the world we see (W-pI.31). In the same section in the manual for teachers cited above, Jesus goes on to say: \"The real basis for doubt about the outcome of any problem that has been given to God's Teacher for resolution is always self-doubt. And that necessarily implies that trust has been placed in an illusory self, for only such a self can be doubted ... Conflict about what you are has entered your mind, and you have become deceived about yourself. And you are deceived about yourself because you have denied the Source of your creation. If you are offering only healing, you cannot doubt. If you really want the problem solved, you cannot doubt. If you are certain what the problem is, you cannot doubt. Doubt is the result of conflicting wishes. Be sure of what you want, and doubt becomes impossible.\" (M-7.5:1-2; 6:3-8). The illusory self is one that believes it is separate not only from others but from God and His All-encompassing Love. That is the misperception that needs to be healed within our own mind before we can be of genuine help to anyone else. Now this does not mean that you will not offer support to your mother in her process of healing, but it will not be done out of any sense of need that she change. Your only role or responsibility as a teacher of God, which Jesus emphasizes in many places in A Course in Miracles, including this section, is to accept the Atonement for yourself (e.g., T-2.V.5:1; M-7.3:2). And he further elaborates: \"The teacher of God is a miracle worker because he gives the gifts he has received. Yet he must first accept them. He need do no more, nor is there more that he could do. By accepting healing he can give it. If he doubts this, let him remember Who gave the gift and Who received it. Thus is his doubt corrected. He thought the gifts of God could be withdrawn. That was a mistake, but hardly one to stay with. And so the teacher of God can only recognize it for what it is, and let it be corrected for him\" (M-7.3:3-11; italics added)."

    "text_input": "Q #675: What does A Course in Miracles say about a person who has tried to be loving, kind, and giving to someone, and trying to use the Course's principle of seeing the Christ in them, and having that person treat you with anger, rudeness, unkindness, and just plain nastiness? I know that this is not who he truly is; but his darkness has affected our relationship and his toxic behavior has gotten the best of me. I have reacted in unkind ways myself. I feel as if I have failed the lessons the Holy Spirit has presented me. How many times do I have to forgive myself? How can I justify someone's poor behavior? I want to see this person as a loving brother, and I want to be seen as a loving brother in return. How can a miracle happen when there is so much separation?",
    "output": "You may be trying too hard! You just have to monitor your ego reactions and bring them to the non-judgmental love of Jesus in your mind, and do nothing else. You do not have to work at seeing the Christ in this other person. When you have let go of your judgments and specialness needs, you will automatically perceive the Christ in him and yourself as well. That is the meaning of the powerful statement in the text, \"If he speaks not of Christ to you, you spoke not of Christ to him. You hear but your own voice, and if Christ speaks through you, you will hear Him\" (T-11.V.18:6-7). For most of us, the process of getting to this level develops gradually over a period of time because of our resistance to being permanently without judgment and specialness needs. That is why your focus should be on not judging yourself for getting angry and being judgmental, rather than on trying to stop yourself from getting angry and being judgmental. There's a big difference between the two approaches to forgiveness. When you tire of forgiving yourself, you can be sure that the ego has snuck into the process and therefore self- condemnation and guilt have crept in as well, for you could never tire of turning to the gentle love of Jesus that sees the complete meaningless of your ego and invites you to remain forever in that quiet center in your mind instead of the ego's turbulent prison of perpetual conflict. Your inner peace, as you are already aware, does not depend on whether your friend is kind to you or not, or whether you maintain the friendship or not (in form). Perhaps associating with one another is not in either of your best interests--you cannot see the entirety of your or your friend's Atonement path. Leaving a relationship can be a right-minded decision or a wrong- minded decision, just as the decision to stay in a relationship can be right- or wrong-minded. The content in your mind is the only important factor. It is normal to expect a friend to be respectful and kind to you, but that should not be a condition of your love for him, reflecting the unconditional love of God for His Son. The behavior of not continuing the relationship may still be bound to the content of love in your mind, in which case you would only feel peace. While forgiveness never condones or justifies unloving behavior, it does perceive its roots in overwhelming fear and guilt, which is why condemnation is never an appropriate response. Yet, forgiveness never requires that a person stay in an abusive relationship simply to learn lessons. The ego, of course, would encourage that, for then you would always have a reason for feeling separate and not at peace: \"I tried, but my friend's toxicity infected me. It wasn't my fault.\" Our unconscious and overwhelming fear of love is typically defended against through that kind of ego dynamic. That is why trying to stop your reaction will never be successful for long. Not judging yourself for your ego reactions will be successful in the long run, though, as you allow yourself to see what it is costing you to hold on to your judgments."

  {
    "text_input": "Q #676: The process of forgiveness of in A Course in Miracles is to remember, each time an unpleasant thought comes to awareness, that the anger, worry, fear or other troubling thought originated in the mind and was projected out to the seemingly external situation. However, often I find myself going a step further. I picture myself as the \"decision maker\" actually choosing the situation. So, for example, if I think I'm angry because I believe someone cheated me, I picture myself actually inventing the entire situation out of whole cloth. This immediately defuses the situation in my mind and removes any anger or feeling of being put upon by someone else. While this is certainly in keeping with the Course's metaphysics, it implies that each of us, as seeming individuals, is responsible for the bad acts of others. However, I find the process more useful in reestablishing peace in my mind than the other process of just thinking that the feeling originated in my mind and not the entire situation.",
    "output": "One of the most important teachings of the Course is that we are minds with the power to choose. It also tells us clearly that our choice is always between the ego's thought that the separation is real and the Holy Spirit's thought that it is not real. It is very important to remember that the \"decision maker\" only chooses between the ego and the Holy Spirit, not among specific circumstances in the world of form. \"The power of decision is all that is yours. What you can decide between is fixed, because there are no alternatives except truth and illusion\" (T-14.III.4:3-4). The process you describe (seeing the specific circumstances as made up) may not be helpful because it obscures the real choice that was made in the mind and, most importantly, its purpose. Everything (good and bad, positive and negative) in the world was made to keep us focused on our identity as bodies in direct attack on the Identity God gave us as minds. Our goal is to get in touch with the mind that is actively choosing the ego instead of the Holy Spirit, and to take responsibility for that choice. If we are going to learn to make another choice, we cannot skip this step. Diffusing the negative effects of the choice by using mental imagery will not get us to the heart of the matter. It may bring temporary relief, but it will not lead us back home. The goal of the Course is to awaken from the dream of separation, not to have a more pleasant dream. The process of forgiveness, which leads us to awakening, requires that we become more and more sensitive to our negative reactions (and positive ones, for that matter). They are the important clues to the activity of our minds. We are asked to shift our focus from the circumstances of the situation entirely, and to focus on the thoughts in our minds. In this practice it does not matter that the situation was made up and ultimately means nothing. The important thing is to recognize that it means something now in the experience of it. If you find this exercise helps you begin the process, it is a very good way to get started. Jesus does tell us the world is all made up. It is also important to recognize the actual \"chain of events\" in the mind as the Course explains them, so as not to short circuit the process. The Holy Spirit needs us to give Him all our twisted misperceptions in the specific form that we have made them up. \"All things you made have use to Him [the Holy Spirit], for His most holy purpose. He knows you are not separate from God, but He perceives much in your mind that lets you think you are\" (T-14.VI.5:3-4). He needs our mistakes and we need His help. Our feelings, reactions, and perceptions are useful to the Holy Spirit because they make up the classroom where He teaches us the forgiveness that leads to true healing. Only then will the effects of the belief in separation be dispelled along with the thought of separation which gave rise to them: \"When the thought of separation has been changed to one of true forgiveness, will the world be seen in quite another light; and one which leads to truth, where all the world must disappear and all its errors vanish. Now its source has gone, and its effects are gone as well\" (W-pII.3.1:4-5). When we have learned through forgiveness that we are, in fact, as God created us, and no longer fear this truth, we will know that the world and our experience of it is made up. Then we will not react at all to its insanity. That is the true peace we seek."

    "text_input": "Q #677: Would you kindly assist me in understanding the section of Chapter 27, titled \"The 'Hero' of the Dream,\" in particular, the meaning of the following quote:  \"Though the dream itself takes many forms, and seems to show a great variety of places and events wherein its 'hero' finds itself, the dream has but one purpose, taught in many ways. This single lesson does it try to teach again, and still again, and yet once more; that it is cause and not effect. And you are its effect, and cannot be its cause\" (T-27.VIII.3:3-4).",
    "output": "This passage is saying that the ego's purpose for the dream is to deceive us into believing that we are each a single, lonely figure in the dream of the world, each with our own separate interests and needs, rather than the dreamer of the dream of the world and all the figures in it. If we are a figure--a body--in the dream, then we are the dream's effect and the dream is our cause. But if we are the dreamer, we are the cause and the dream/world is the effect. To help understand this passage further, consider what is really happening in the split mind and what the ego wants us to believe, described in the sentences you quote. The \"you\" Jesus is addressing and is always referring to in A Course in Miracles is our mind, outside of time and space and outside the dream. It is the split mind of the Son of God, after we have seemingly fallen asleep and begun to dream of separation. Much like what we experience in our nighttime dreams, we do not remember that we are the dreamer but think instead that we are one of the figures in the dream, a body, the \"hero\" of the dream. So we have accepted the body as our identity and believe that all of the rest of the dream--the world--is outside of ourselves, beyond our control, exerting its influence on us against our will. And yet all along, we, as the dreaming mind, are making the whole thing up. But this confusion about our identity is exactly what the ego wants us to believe in order to achieve its purpose--to keep us asleep and dreaming the dream of separation, without ever realizing that it is our dream. So the world we seem to be experiencing outside of our physical selves, which includes our parents and their parents, etc., seems to be the cause of the self we think we are--the body. In other words, the ego has convinced us that we, as a body which contains a brain which reacts and thinks and feels, are the effect of the world, and how we feel is a result of our interactions with that outside world and all the people in it. So we never consider the possibility that we, as a mind, are not the effect but rather the cause of the world, of the dream. And this subterfuge serves a very deliberate purpose, for now the cause of all of our unhappiness and pain and loss seems to be the world/the dream, rather than the decision we are making within our mind to see ourselves as separate from love. If we really knew our own choice is the cause, we would not remain asleep and dreaming much longer, and the ego--the thought of separation --would then simply disappear. Think again of your dreams at night. We may have all kinds of experiences in the dream that we attribute to the other figures and the \"outer world\" of our dream while we are still asleep and dreaming. But upon awakening, we recognize that all those feelings were not caused by anything in the dream itself but rather by our mind that was dreaming the entire contents of the dream, including both the dream figure we thought we were and everything seemingly separate from it. The dream is one, single, unitary illusion that continues to fool us about reality while we remain asleep. So one of Jesus' primary objectives with the Course is to help us understand the real nature of cause and effect, so we can undo our confusion and eventually remember Who we truly are, beyond even the illusory split mind. In a lovely passage early in the text, Jesus calls to us: \"Hear, then, the one answer of the Holy Spirit to all the questions the ego raises: You are a child of God, a priceless part of His Kingdom, which He created as part of Him. Nothing else exists and only this is real. You have chosen a sleep in which you have had bad dreams, but the sleep is not real and God calls you to awake. There will be nothing left of your dream when you hear Him, because you will awaken. Your dreams contain many of the ego's symbols and they have confused you. Yet that was only because you were asleep and did not know. When you wake you will see the truth around you and in you, and you will no longer believe in dreams because they will have no reality for you. Yet the Kingdom and all that you have created there will have great reality for you, because they are beautiful and true\" (T-6.IV.6)."

    "text_input": "Q #678: Can you please explain paragraphs 3 to 8 in the section \"Looking Within\" in Chapter 12 of A Course in Miracles (T-12.VII).",
    "output": "We are not able to comment on these paragraphs line by line because of space limitations, so we will highlight the main ideas. In paragraphs 3 and 4, Jesus builds on the first two paragraphs in the section, teaching us that the Holy Spirit is not a physical or tangible presence as a person, but that miracles witness to His Presence and to where and what He is. This is because miracles transcend \"every law of time and space, of magnitude and mass\" (T-12.VII.3:3), and therefore the source of miracles must be the mind, which is outside time and space, and specifically, the part of our mind that contains the correction for all the errors of separation. Prior to these two paragraphs, Jesus referred to the process of generalizing and learning thereby that \"there is no order of difficulty in miracles\" (T-12.VII.1:2-3). Miracles, thus, are not bound by any of the laws that operate in the world--they cut across all of time and space, magnitude and mass. The Holy Spirit, as the source of miracles in our minds therefore transcends the world and its laws in every way. Paragraph 5 is extremely important and is at the heart of what Jesus is teaching us throughout his course. It overturns completely what we usually think perception is all about; namely, that it begins with external stimuli affecting our senses. Quite to the contrary, Jesus instructs us, perception is a result of a choice our minds have made to manifest an internal thought system we have identify with: \"You see what you expect, and you expect what you invite. Your perception is the result of your invitation, coming to you as you sent for it ... Two ways of looking at the world are in your mind, and your perception will reflect the guidance you have chosen\" (T-12.VII.5:1-2,6). This foreshadows the important principle: projection makes perception. We first look within, decide whether hate or love is real and then we project out what we have made real inside. Thus we expect to find hatred outside because we put it there; importantly, this does not mean that our decision is responsible for what other people do. This is solely about our internal experience. In that sense, we (as decision-making minds) invite either the ego or the Holy Spirit to direct our thinking. We will know which choice we have made by looking at what we are perceiving outside, because, again, what we perceive and make real outside is coming from what we first made real inside. The manifestation of forgiveness will be our growing perception that we all share the same interests, and so we will be less and less attracted to the one-or-the-other/kill-or- be-killed mentality: competition, comparisons, sacrifice, getting what we want at someone else's expense. The manifestations of the rule of guilt in our minds will be perceptions of victimization, clashing interests and goals, insatiable needs, accompanied by feelings of anger, fear, triumph, etc. Note again that this is not about the objective forms in the world, but about our perception or interpretation of them. That is why Jesus says there are \"two ways of looking\"--we can look at (perceive) the same form in two different ways, depending on the \"guidance\" we have chosen. This is the basis for what next appears in paragraphs 6 through 8. In addition to reinforcing the principles of perception in paragraph 5, Jesus addresses the conflict in our mind's seeking and its maladaptive solution to that conflict. The conflict arises from our decision to maintain our separation and our individuality (with all the guilt and self-hatred connected with that) and seek for love at the same time. But the two are mutually exclusive (love and specialness). So we attempt to be loving without sacrificing specialness, thus keeping the split, but suppressing it by appearing to have one goal, \"the illusion of integrity\" (T-12.VII.7:9): love. This internal split between the wrong mind (the thought system of hatred) and the right mind (the thought system of love), if not resolved in the mind, must get projected out, meaning that the good and bad will be seen outside, not within one's own mind, where we always have the opportunity to accept the illusory nature of the wrong mind. The world, both personal and collective, will then be perceived as a battleground with ceaseless conflict between opposing forces. Thus, \"good\" people will seek to destroy those they think are evil, and feel justified, even divinely sanctioned in doing so. How many examples have there been throughout the centuries of condemnation and death conferred in the name of love?--out of their love for God and Jesus, people have judged and killed others, the slaying of pagans and heretics by Christians being but one prominent expression. Martyrdom and sacrifice witness to the same projection: the pure and innocent suffer and die at the hands of the evil and wicked. The split within the mind is thus seen and dealt with outside the mind. Religions give voice to this in their teaching that suffering and death are both demanded and blessed by God. This is the love born of the mind that has chosen to keep separation real and seek for love at the same time. Separate, conflicting interests prevail. When the conflict of wanting both specialness and love remains unresolved in the mind, our seeking after love will always be contaminated by our desire for specialness, which unfortunately means that more often than not we will think we are coming from love, when we are really driven by the selfishness of special love, as the examples above well affirm. That is the purpose of Jesus' teaching: to help us recognize what we are doing so that we can heal the split in our minds, not continue to project it. Thus, in paragraph 8 he tells us, \"when you want only love you will see nothing else\" (T-12.VII.8:1). Nothing in the world may have changed, but when we have looked within our minds and have chosen against the ego, we will then perceive only love: shared interests, extensions of love or calls for love, without exception. Again, if you want to know which teacher you have chosen, pay attention to how you perceive what appears to be outside you--how you react to it. Perception is interpretation. Do you see evil and sin all around you calling out for the ego's version of justice (punishment and vengeance)?--or do you see frightened calls for love? Which you see will be determined by which teacher you chose inside."

    "text_input": "Q #679: I have always enjoyed the whole idea that the journey, A Course in Miracles, the return to God, is not an if but a when. The journey is sure because once the idea of separation entered our minds, time \"rolled out\" and then the journey to return began with time \"rolling up\" along a path that takes us nowhere but back to our Father (ultimately, though the path is wide and offers room to wander). However, in the Epilogue (C-ep) I see for the first time in the Course an element of uncertainty; namely, \"Our new beginning has the certainty the journey lacked till now.\" Further, the Epilogue hints strongly that we started this journey before and got lost ... that it is an \"ancient journey\" leading to an \"ancient door\" that is held open by the \"Holy of Holies.\" But for some reason, our path was not sure. I'm confused about this; can you please shed some light on this?",
    "output": "Take heart! It is still when not if. Jesus is speaking (singing, really) from where he is outside time and space, his vision encompassing the entire Atonement path. Symbolically, metaphorically, and with the use of biblical imagery, Jesus is telling Helen (and all of us) that in truth, nothing happened and we never truly separated from God: \"Not one note in Heaven's song was missed\" (T-26.V.5:4), and so we have no cause to fear God; hatred has not triumphed over love; we are not guilty of unforgiveable sin. We may have tried different paths in other lifetimes, but our decision finally to accept his love (in the form of A Course in Miracles) will resolve our ambivalence completely, meaning we have at last accepted that \"what is false is false, and what is true has never changed\" (W-pII.10.1:1). The references to reincarnation are unmistakable, but from Jesus' perspective, what appears to us as a linear process, a journey with multiple roads, paths, and detours, is really not that: it is all one to him. How impossible it is to use words to convey what transcends words and physical existence entirely! To us, it is a process in which we switch back and forth between the ego and Jesus, between judgment and forgiveness, but with the confidence that we cannot fail to reach our goal of peace (W-pI.131). Until we recognized his message (\"God's Son is guiltless, and in his innocence is his salvation\" [M-1.3:5]), we had followed the ego's compromise approach: truth and illusion; love and fear; sin and innocence; spirit and body. The \"new beginning,\" thus, is the commitment to awaken from the dream of separation and duality by resigning as our own teacher (T-12.V.8:3), gladly accepting that we have been wrong about everything, and gratefully allowing ourselves to be taught by our new teacher. That is what Jesus means by this journey, which may seem new, but is not, because we are simply denying our denial of the truth (T-12.II.1:5), and therefore accepting ourselves as God created us. We lost our way by substituting a false identity for our true Identity and wandering into a world of separation and individuality. Therefore, \"the journey to God is merely the reawakening of the knowledge of where you are always, and what you are forever. It is a journey without distance to a goal that has never changed\" (T-8.VI.9:6-7). In this sense, there is neither when nor if, because there is no temporal journey. We are \"at home in God, dreaming of exile\" (T-10.2:1). With this clarity of purpose, uncertainty is nothing more than a defense that will weaken and then dissolve completely."

    "text_input": "Q #680: Jesus often says in A Course in Miracles that I am only to trust in my willingness. At various times I thought I couldn't have been more willing, but instead it seems I took the route of choosing a more vicious ego. I have understood since then, with your helpful service, that references like these refer to my mind (outside time/space). The same goes for Jesus' comment about the Course not offering practical advice--what could be more straightforward than being told to ask for help. So again, since I thought I had asked for help before reading that, the only calm way I can understand it is that it is referring to metaphysical me. I need clarification, though, that waiting in faith that the answers will come is not ego-based itself. I have tried to make it in the world while having faith that my trying would come to be replaced with following the Holy Spirit. Obviously I wasn't willing enough, and now I can't even make it in the world. I have tried professional help, but it seems I would need Guidance to make that worldly decision now too as much as any other decision. To ask here is difficult, too, because the answers I know are simply to observe myself and to see what smokescreen my ego dynamics are serving and to turn them over. Your service has been helpfully calming, though, so I ask, Do I (try to) try again in my own way (I would probably pick somewhere to volunteer), or would this be interfering (and lead to another \"failure\")?",
    "output": "Jesus is always talking about the decision maker in the mind. This is not the Mind (capital M) of Christ, though, if that is what you mean by the \"metaphysical me.\" It is the part of the split mind that can decide for or against the ego. Our experience is the direct result of that choice, which is why Jesus is always addressing the decision maker; there is no independent self in the world apart from the mind. That self is simply the projection of the decision maker; Jesus would not be talking to a projection. The \"little willingness\" that he asks of us is the willingness to be proven wrong--that our experience of separation, attack, and separate interests--even our self-concepts--are really misperceptions. When we side with the ego, we are saying: I am not as God created me! We do that by identifying with a self that is limited, imperfect, and always struggling to survive in a world of victims and victimizers. So Jesus tells us that \"to learn this course requires willingness to question every value that you hold\" (T-24.in.2:1). We need to bring our misperceptions to his truth, our darkness to his light, where they can be replaced with true perception. But we must first be willing to acknowledge that we have been wrong in how we have been perceiving everything. Then authentic change can occur. The change, though, would be in our choice of teachers in our mind, not necessarily in circumstances in the world. And that willingness need not be perfect, he assures us: \" ... be not disturbed that shadows surround it. That is why you came. If you could come without them you would not need the holy instant\" (T-18.IV.2:4-6). In view of this, how your life is going in the world cannot be used as a measure of your willingness to be led by the Holy Spirit or Jesus. The content of one's mind cannot be judged by the form of one's life. Jesus' life in the world did not go all that well in the world's terms; yet he tells us that his internal experience of peace never changed, and he asks that we follow his example in the trying circumstances of our own lives (T-6.I). Our lives, then, become classrooms in which Jesus as our chosen teacher can help us use all relationships and circumstances to get in touch with the blocks to that peace in our minds. They mirror back to us the thought system or teacher we have chosen in our minds, not by what is going on, but by how we perceive what is going on--our internal reactions. Thus, as you commented, problems in our bodies and the world are \"smokescreens\" concealing the real conflict in our minds. They are a means of proving that we are right about ourselves and reality. That is what we must get in touch with, and why Jesus places so much emphasis on purpose. That is what he helps us with. Professional help can be supportive of the process of letting go of your ego. A kind therapist could help you get in touch with some of the specific expressions in your life of the ego's dynamics of separation, even though that vocabulary may never be used. It is not an easy process because of the layers of defenses we usually all have, and so a skilled therapist can be quite helpful in that regard. Finally, do whatever you feel you would like to do; if assisting as a volunteer is appealing to you, then why not follow that? That is not the central issue. Your focus should be internal--your willingness to be proven wrong about your self-perception, so that the truth about you can emerge from concealment. When you are joined with Jesus or the Holy Spirit in your mind, any situation or interaction (regardless of the form) can be a joyful one in terms of its purpose: another opportunity to release the pain of separation and accept the peace of an identity of love shared by us all. As that remains your focus more and more, you will depend less and less on things going well externally in order to be happy and peaceful. And that in turn means that your (your mind's) identification with the body will lessen as well--even as you continue to attend responsibly and maturely to its normal needs."

    "text_input": "Q #681: I frequently ask the Holy Spirit to guide my life and purpose, which seems to have coincided with offers to work as a \"Healer\" (hands-on or touch therapy). My aversion to participate in these forms of \"healing\" is that as a student of A Course in Miracles, I understand that only the mind needs healing and that the body, and sickness for that matter, are illusions. I also understand that I cannot offer healing to/for others. However, in my quest for answers I came upon the manual for teachers and its references to the \"patient\" of the teachers of God (M- 5,6). What does this mean? Is it really just as simple as accepting healing for my own mind and then just knowing that that has transferred to all of my brothers? If so, why the word \"patient,\" as if there is someone outside myself to focus healing upon?",
    "output": "It really is as simple as you describe, as Jesus explains in Lesson 161: \"One brother is all brothers. Every mind contains all minds, for every mind is one. Such is the truth.\" But he continues: \"Yet do these thoughts make clear the meaning of creation? Do these words bring perfect clarity with them to you? What can they seem to be but empty sounds; pretty, perhaps, correct in sentiment, yet fundamentally not understood nor understandable. The mind that taught itself to think specifically can no longer grasp abstraction in the sense that it is all-encompassing. We need to see a little, that we learn a lot\" (W-pI.161.4). Therefore Jesus must use our language and our experience of duality and specifics as the starting point of a process that will end with our sharing his vision of oneness. Our experience is that we live in a world with other people, relating to them in various ways. We all find ourselves at some time or other in the presence of someone who is sick or suffering; so Jesus is teaching us how to approach these situations in a truly helpful way. In the Psychotherapy pamphlet, he does this in the specific context of the therapist-patient relationship. The heart of this process is our learning to focus more and more on the purpose of what we do, and that there is no hierarchy of illusions--there are no degrees of truth among them (T-23.II.2- 3). This means that there is nothing unholy in the world, and certainly nothing holy either. Thus, \"hands-on\" or \"touch\" therapy is no different from anything else in the world. The purpose for which it is used is all that is important for one's spiritual progress. The Holy Spirit can use anything we made (all forms of individuality and special relationships) to help us unlearn what the ego taught us and learn His lessons instead: that we all share the same interests and in that sense we are not different in any meaningful sense. That objective can be achieved in any role in the world: parent, healer, patient, attorney, musician, fire fighter, astronaut, etc. A very liberating approach! An aversion to a specific form of the illusion means that you believe some illusions are worse than others--a favorite means of the ego to validate separation and keep us away from the content in our minds. So, yes, you are correct about the nature of the healing process according to the Course; but remember that because you still think you are specific, healing must take place in a specific context. The specifics of your life are the classroom in which you learn to undo your belief in separation. \"The Special Function\" is an especially helpful section to read in this regard (T- 25.VI). Don't lose sight of the form-content distinction. It is not what you do that matters, but the purpose for which you do it. If you were to engage in touch therapy, for example, you could use that form to learn the content that you and your patient are not separate and that you both believe you left Heaven; you both have the same wrong mind, the same right mind, and the ability to choose between them; you both long to return to God but are afraid that you will not be welcomed back and will be punished instead. In this sense, you would not be there to give your patient something you have that he lacks, which is how the ego would have you think of your purpose, and how others and your patient might see it. All that is important is what is going on in your mind, because that is where both the mistake and the correction are, as well as the Help."

    "text_input": "Q #682: What is Jesus referring to in A Course in Miracles when he talks about \"abilities\"? In Chapter 7 in \"Healing as the Recognition of Truth\" and in \"Healing and the Changelessness of Mind\" abilities are mentioned several times, and also in the teachers' manual #25: \"Are Psychic Powers Desirable?\"",
    "output": "The Course tells us that the only meaningful ability is the mind's ability to choose between the insanity of the ego (separation) and the Holy Spirit's healing (undoing separation). Jesus tells us in the text: \"Healing is the one ability everyone can develop and must develop if he is to be healed\" (T-7.V.3:1). In the curriculum of the Course, this healing is accomplished through forgiveness. Forgiveness, therefore, is the only ability we truly need to develop and practice, practice, practice. It won't get us to Carnegie Hall, but it will eventually get us to our home where we belong, and never truly left. When the mind chooses the ego and identifies with the body, it misuses the power it shares with God by projecting it into a variety of \"abilities\" that mimic the mind's true function. The ego thus develops its own logic with \"abilities\" that serve its goal of separation. What appear to be the use of reason, e.g. thinking, learning, imagination, memory, are actually functions of the body's brain. They serve the ego well by using the logic of its \"reason\" to support and defend the belief that the separation is real and life outside of Heaven is possible. In the section \"Healing as the Recognition of Truth\" (T-7.IV), as in many sections of the Course (T-9.III.8; T-14.VI.5; T- 21.III.6; W-pI.64), we are told that the Holy Spirit can use everything the ego has made for His purpose of healing. Indeed, the study of the Course requires many intellectual abilities. It is, in itself, an example of how the Holy Spirit uses the ego's abilities for the purpose of learning His curriculum. He uses the ego's distortion of the mind's power to return it to its only meaningful ability, which is to choose, then guides it in learning to make the only real choice, which is to accept the Identity God gave us as His innocent Son. We are not asked to deny that we think we are bodies with specific abilities. In fact, a very important part of the learning process is seeing how impressive and important we think our abilities are. But Jesus tells us in the text: \"The body is merely part of your experience in the physical world. Its abilities can be and frequently are overevaluated\" (T-2.IV.3:8-9). \"Overevaluated\" is an understatement, considering Jesus tells us elsewhere in the text: \"At no single instant does the body exist at all\" (T-18.VII.3:1). It is only our belief in it and its abilities that requires the Holy Spirit's help and the curriculum the Course sets forth to show us the way out of the ego's thought system, using the specifics it made. And so we are told: \"Abilities must be developed before you can use them. This is not true of anything that God created, but it is the kindest solution possible for what you made. In an impossible situation [belief in the separation], you can develop your abilities to the point where they can get you out of it. You have a Guide to how to develop them, but you have no commander except yourself\" (T-6.IV.9:1-4). In other words, only we can decide whether our \"abilities\" will be used by the ego or the Holy Spirit. Awareness of abilities may be heightened as they are given to the Holy Spirit for His purpose of healing. This explains why a person may seem to have new psychic ability as fear of the mind's power is diminished: \"Those who have developed \"psychic\" powers have simply let some of the limitations they laid upon their minds be lifted\" (M-25.6:7). The ability has always been there and is the same for everyone. Once it is discovered, like any ability, it can be used to strengthen belief in the ego or the Holy Spirit. It is important to remember that the ability is nothing in itself. It is the purpose it serves that is extremely important: \"Only two purposes are possible. And one is sin (separation), the other holiness (undoing separation). Nothing is in between ... \" (T-20.VIII.9:1-3). However impressive they may be, these abilities are only shadows of the mind's ability to remember \"the glorious surprise\" of Who we are (M-25.1:5). Our concern remains, as always, to apply every ability we may have to the process of forgiveness (healing) that it may serve ultimately to undo our belief in the body and all its \"abilities.\""

    "text_input": "Q #683: I am working as a Hospice Nurse, since I began living the Course I am finding it difficult to \"help people die.\" In A Course in Miracles it says that by believing in sickness and in death, I am denying God, since He did not create these illusions, and that by believing in these illusions I have created another god. I do not believe in what I am doing, however I am unable to change vocations due to money issues. How can I live by the truth and still be involved with \"magic\" and illusion?",
    "output": "The Course teaches that \"there is no death\" (T-3.VII.5:11) because \"there is no life outside of Heaven\" (T-23.II.19:1). This truth applies to our reality as minds. However, when a choice is made to believe that the separation is real, identity with the ego and the body follows. In this choice is God denied, and sickness and death become part of the illusory experience that is the effect of this choice. The goal of the Course is to teach us that we are minds with the power to choose between truth and illusion. What we choose then determines our experience in the dream. We are not asked to try to change the beliefs that make up the thought system of the ego, nor to deny that we do believe them. Doing so makes them real, thereby giving them power over us. We are asked to pay attention to our beliefs and judgments, because they show us the choice made in the mind that has been denied and forgotten, so we can choose again. Though in truth sickness and death are not real, and thus have no effect, to bodies they seem to be real indeed. Their purpose is to make the body real, and to keep us rooted in the belief that the separation actually occurred. Belief in sickness and death is relinquished as the mind is healed of the thought of separation. This is not something we can do by trying to convince ourselves that what we see and experience is not real. In fact, Jesus tells us gently, but clearly that we should not deny our belief in the body: \"The body is merely part of your experience in the physical world. Its abilities [including sickness and death] can be and frequently are overevaluated. However, it is almost impossible to deny its existence in this world. Those who do so are engaging in a particularly unworthy form of denial\" (T-2.IV.3:8-11). What we are asked to do is recognize that we do believe we are bodies in the world, that we get sick and die. The very fact that we experience ourselves as bodies in a dream of death is a magic trick. It occurs when the mind that chooses separation projects the guilt for this choice outward on to the body and world. The hope that Jesus' loving message in the Course offers is that all the magic we believe in can be transformed by the Holy Spirit through forgiveness. \"The body was not made by love. Yet love does not condemn it and can use it lovingly, respecting what the Son of God has made and using it to save him from illusions\" (T-18.VI.4:7-8). Fortunately for us, this applies to every illusion we experience in the dream, including sickness, death, jobs, and magic. Learning to forgive ourselves for our mistaken beliefs helps us bring more compassion and understanding to all our relationships, since everyone shares these beliefs. This is how any job, as well as every aspect of our lives, become a classroom for applying the Course's teaching of forgiveness. Seeing that nothing external in our lives needs to change, because it is part of our classroom, corrects the ego's first law of chaos that there is a \"hierarchy of illusions\" (T- 23.II.2:3). In our interactions with people at work or in our personal lives, all our thoughts and judgments based on differences show us the choice for separation we have made in our minds. Being willing to recognize that whatever we experience is the result of a choice taking place in the mind, rather than the circumstances of our lives, is the first, and very important, step in the transformation from magic to miracle. It is a process of bringing illusion to truth, and is the way to \"live by truth\" while being \"involved with 'magic.'\""

    "text_input": "Q #684: I am new to A Course in Miracles and I would like to ask about remaining in the present moment. If I remain present, is that when I will feel the peace of mind that I am seeking? I have experienced brief moments of inner peace and calm when I remain present with the Holy Spirit. I just don't know how to remain present for longer than five minutes.",
    "output": "Until the mind is fully healed, the experience of peace is limited to our willingness to choose it. Meanwhile, the mind is split, and in conflict between two mutually exclusive \"realities\": belief in the separation (ego) and the memory of Oneness (Holy Spirit). Early in the text we are told: \"The separation is merely another term for a split mind. The ego is the symbol of separation, just as the Holy Spirit is the symbol of peace\" (T-5.III.9:3-4). The unhealed, split mind experiences itself in the dream, in conflict with itself. While seeking peace, it fears that total peace will mean the disappearance of the specialness of being a body with a unique personality. This split in the mind causes us to have divided goals: \"The ego's goal is as unified as the Holy Spirit's, and it is because of this that their goals can never be reconciled in any way or to any extent. The ego always seeks to divide and separate. The Holy Spirit always seeks to unify and heal\" (T-7.IV.5:1-3). Choosing the Holy Spirit and the holy instant results in the moment's peace you refer to, while the choice to cling to separation brings this peace to an end. How little time we spend in peace shows us the degree to which we are attached to our identity with the ego and afraid of peace. Healing the mind of this split is the goal of the Course. It happens gradually through the process of forgiveness, which begins with the recognition that the separation is a choice made in the mind, and everything we experience in the dream is an effect of that choice. Denial is key to the ego's success in convincing us of the reality of separation. The mind forgets/denies its choice in order to defend it. It is then possible to believe the ego's story that we are not minds, but bodies vulnerable to attack by external forces beyond our control. That explains why it seems that peace comes and goes, and we are at the mercy of its whims. The Course tells us that we are anything but victims, and that we can learn to recognize the mind's choice by paying attention to our feelings and judgments in the dream. Loss of peace in its myriad forms (anger, depression, anxiety, irritation, excitement ... ) makes us aware of the choice the mind has made. Paying attention/looking is the key to undoing denial, which is the beginning of salvation, because it tunes us in to the fact that we have a mind with the power to choose. Only by recognizing the painful effects of choosing to identify with the ego will we be motivated to make another choice. Otherwise, we remain unaware of the mind's activity, puzzled by the feelings that seem to come upon us from \"nowhere.\" Though they may be of short duration, moments of peace are very important to the Holy Spirit's curriculum, which makes good use of contrast for teaching and learning. It becomes increasingly obvious that feeling truly peaceful is preferable to the turmoil of unforgiveness. What is difficult is learning to associate the lack of peace with the judgments that we are engaged in constantly. Peace just seems to disappear for no reason. What actually occurs is that our minds have chosen to identify with the ego and our specialness. Guilt follows that choice, and is inevitably projected in some form of judgment against ourselves and others. This happens very quickly and, thanks to denial, imperceptibly. In the Course, Jesus is asking us to pay very careful attention to our thoughts, to become aware of the judgments. They show us the choice for separation we have made and have forgotten. Both the peace and lack of it are useful experiences. One shows us how it feels to be free of judgment, the other the pain of choosing the ego. The important thing is to remember that when we are not at peace, it is for no other reason than our choice to be separate. We have chosen to identify with the ego rather than with the Holy Spirit, and preferred guilt to peace. We now have the opportunity to consider the cost of our mistaken choice and choose again. This mindfulness is how we remain in the present, and how not being peaceful becomes a useful tool to lead us back to peace. We also need to remember not to judge ourselves for long periods of forgetfulness and short periods of peace. Allowing the Holy Spirit to heal our minds of the thought of separation is a process. Our function is to be mindful of every judgment so it can be forgiven. Gradually the balance will shift to longer experiences of peace, until that becomes our only choice."

    "text_input": "Q #685: In the workbook of A Course in Miracles, I was engaged with Lesson 122, and a very beautiful lesson it is, when a word in paragraph 10 caught my attention: \"We are close indeed to the appointed ending of the dream\" (W-pI.122.10:4). Could you please elaborate on \"appointed\"?",
    "output": "In this context, the ending of the dream is \"appointed\" because it is certain, and in reality it is already accomplished, because \"... the separation never occurred\" (T-6.II.10:7). Everyone will come to this realization in his/her own time, and will awaken from the dream: \"Forget not once this journey is begun the end is certain. Doubt along the way will come and go and go to come again. Yet is the ending sure. No one can fail to do what God appointed him to do\" [i.e., accept the Identity God has given to His Son] (C-ep.1:1-4). The \"appointed\" moment does not refer to a specific time in the dream, but refers to a decision in the mind that is outside of time and space. However, Jesus knows that we believe we are actually separate from God, living in time and space, and so he speaks to us on the level of our experience in the dream. He tells us throughout the Course that to end the dream all that is required is for us to remember the truth that we have denied, to forget everything else, and in an instant we would awaken. That is why the ending is \"close\"; it is always only an instant away. While we continue to choose separation, however, we use time as a delay mechanism to defend our choice: \"Delay is of the ego, because time is its concept\" (T-5.III.5:1). Time is one of the ego's best defenses for its tale of sin, guilt, and fear. Only in time can we defend our belief in the punishment from God we think is our due for the terrible \"sin\" of choosing against Him in the past. The ego insists that one of these days God will get us. We also use our concept of time to project salvation outside of ourselves to a distant moment in the future, because we are afraid of accepting it in the present. Thus, contrary to the popular saying \"time waits for no man,\" time is actually under the command of the ego. For its purpose of refusing to accept our oneness with God, which would end the dream, we have all the time in the world. Time will indeed wait for us to choose again, because we made it up explicitly to serve our delay tactics. That is why, in our experience, the dream seems to be lasting eons. In the insanity of our split minds, we both fear it will last forever, and hope it will. In his kindness, Jesus assures us it will end, but not abruptly: \"Fear not that you will be abruptly lifted up and hurled into reality. Time is kind, and if you use it on behalf of reality, it will keep gentle pace with you in your transition\" (T-16.VI.8:1-2). The \"appointed\" end of the dream, therefore, is as certain as the Holy Spirit tells us it is, and only as close as we want it to be. In the text, we are told \"Time is your friend, if you leave it to the Holy Spirit to use. He needs but very little to restore God's whole power to you. He Who transcends time for you understands what time is for\" (T-15.I.15:1-3).The dream's concept of time serves the Holy Spirit's purpose when we use it to heal our minds of the thought of separation, seeing each moment as an opportunity to choose forgiveness rather than judgment in the present. Thus the past \"sin\" and future punishment are released of their power to delay us on our journey, bringing the truth closer to our awareness."

    "text_input": "Q #686: In the end of the text, Jesus says that all walk the world \"uncertain, lonely, and in constant fear\" (T31.VIII.7:1). I know that this may seem silly, but I just don't believe that sometimes. I look at someone like Donald Trump; rich, secure, seemingly happy, and it doesn't seem that he feels the way Jesus describes. I know enough now that this question probably reflects my fear that A Course in Miracles is asking sacrifice of me, but some people seem so happy without the Course.",
    "output": "It is important to remember that in the Course Jesus is addressing our minds; more specifically, the part of our minds that remembers the truth of who we really are (the right mind). However, since we have dissociated from our minds and identified with the ego, and thus with the body, we hear his words as applying to the body. He is not speaking to our bodies. It is the mind that identifies with the ego/body that walks the world \"uncertain, lonely, and in constant fear.\" Though they may not be apparent, the loneliness, uncertainty and fear that underlie everyone's existence in the world are the motivation for everything that we seek: money, power, friends, and family. Having believed we are separate from our Source, we feel bankrupt and therefore compelled to fill our physical, psychological, and emotional warehouses to the brim with wealth, health and \"happiness.\" The ego is ingenious in making up its interpretation of \"happiness,\" \"success,\" \"achievement,\" even \"love,\" based on the deep sense of loss that inevitably accompanies the choice for separation. The world offers the illusion of happiness, and on its terms it seems to \"work\" for some people. They seem to \"have it all.\" It is possible to experience the satisfaction of getting what we want, or what we think we want, and it is this that the world calls happiness. However, as it turns out, it is never enough, not even the \"perfect life\" here in the world, and so we seek for more. No doubt Donald Trump, along with many other wealthy, and successful people, would admit that there are more fortunes and more power to be had: \"You never can be too rich or too thin.\" Jesus tells us in the Course, that in choosing to identify with the body and seeking everything the world has to offer, we have short-changed ourselves. \"To identify with the ego is to attack yourself and make yourself poor. That is why everyone who identifies with the ego feels deprived. What he experiences then is depression or anger, because what he did was to exchange Self-love for self-hate, making him afraid of himself. He does not realize this. Even if he is fully aware of anxiety he does not perceive its source as his own ego identification, and he always tries to handle it by making some sort of insane 'arrangement' with the world\" (T-12.III.6:1-5, italics ours). The insane arrangements are all the things we do to avoid feeling the self-hatred; this is what compels us to seek outside of ourselves for comfort and fulfillment. Every value the world holds has its source in the pervasive feeling of emptiness that is the effect of choosing the ego instead of God. Yet nothing ever fills that void. Jesus tells the Donald Trump in all of us that the world/ego is a bad investment: \"The ego is trying to teach you how to gain the whole world and lose your own soul. The Holy Spirit teaches that you cannot lose your soul and there is no gain in the world, for of itself it profits nothing. To invest without profit is surely to impoverish yourself, and the overhead is high. Not only is there no profit in the investment, but the cost to you is enormous. For this investment costs you the world's reality by denying yours, and gives you nothing in return\" (T- 12.VI.1:1-5). A close look at the satisfactions and \"happiness\" the world offer reveals that they are short spent and do not last. Every enjoyment is shadowed by the knowledge that it will end, not to mention that it is nothing but an illusion: \"Illusions will not last. Their death is sure and this alone is certain in their world. It is the ego's world because of this\" (C-2.1:1-3). We cannot effectively extinguish the gnawing sense that everything we seek and achieve has an end, including this \"life\" in a body, and thus we become imprisoned by the relentless pursuit of pleasure, comfort, and meaning in the world. This often extends to the search for meaningful religious experience and fulfillment, in an attempt to calm our fear that we are, in fact, wrong about who we are, and wrong about everything we believe is true and meaningful. As the very first lesson in the workbook tells us: \"Nothing I see ... means anything\" (W-pI.1). How, then, can what is meaningless bring us happiness, comfort, or peace? Not only is it meaningless, everything the world offers is actually a defense against recognizing what is meaningful, since it is the place made by the ego, \"where God could enter not, and where His Son could be apart from Him\" (W- pII.3.2:4). There is no need to worry that we will have to sacrifice or be deprived of anything we think we need as long as we think we need it: \"Only the Holy Spirit knows what you need. For He will give you all things that do not block the way to light. And what else could you need? In time, He gives you all the things that you need have, and will renew them as long as you have need of them. He will take nothing from you as long as you have any need of it. And yet He knows that everything you need is temporary, and will but last until you step aside from all your needs and realize that all of them have been fulfilled\" (T-13.VII.12:1-6). Let's not be fooled by anything else."

    "text_input": "Q #687: I have been a student of A Course in Miracles now for a year and a half. I do a great deal of study of other religions, in an effort to understand others better, seek common ground and connectedness, and to find what feels most \"right\" for me. I have come to realize that there are a number of metaphysical based religions, such as Christian Science, New Thought, Unity, and Religious Science. I am wondering what organized religion do you see as being most closely identified with the teachings of the Course? I feel my purpose, or calling, is toward ministry, but not in the traditional sense. Can you offer any suggestion for direction?  Also, I am a reader of various authors who write from the perspective of the Course, and I have varying reactions to their teachings. How can one be certain that a teacher, who proclaims to understand the Course, has the correct interpretation, given that so many have interpreted the Bible in opposing ways?",
    "output": "Although, as you observe, the Course shares some principles in common with other religious teachings, it really has its own unique contribution to make to facilitating achievement of the objective of any true spiritual teaching--to lead us along the path to egolessness. And so we would suggest that it may be more helpful to understand how it differs from other teachings--so one can make an informed choice about whether this is the path to embrace for oneself--than to identify its similarities with them. So, while the Course, for example, shares an emphasis on forgiveness with many other teachings, including Christianity and the metaphysical religions you mention, it defines forgiveness and its practice in a unique way, based on the metaphysical principles that the world and the self we think we are are illusory projected symbols of guilt (W-pII.1). And although it shares with other paths an underlying assumption about the primacy of mind, its purpose in understanding the \"power\" of the mind to manifest in form is not to access that power in order to control it but rather to demonstrate how painful the results ultimately are if the power is guided by a belief in need and limitation. And while the Course shares the basic premise that the world is an illusion with other spiritualities, including some Eastern religions and New Age teachings, it attributes no divine purpose to the illusion and offers a unique explanation for the world's origin--that it is the result of an ego-based conspiracy promulgated in opposition to God, including a seeming attack on love in order to exclude it from the mind and the mind from it (W-pII.3). The Course is also unique among the world's spiritualities in its blending of the practical and the sublime, in a beautifully integrated whole that never lets us forget where we are heading, at the same time not asking us to deny where we believe we are. It does this through its use of a sophisticated psychodynamic understanding of the ego thought system--drawing on the insights of Freudian psychology with its analysis of guilt, denial and projection as they play out in our special relationships--presented within the uncompromising framework of its non-dualistic metaphysics, which holds that the thought of separation, as well as all its seeming consequences, is an illusion. In response to your feeling of being called toward non-traditional ministry, the Course offers a relatively unique perspective on that as well (M-in.1). It would never advocate any specific role for any of us in the world, but rather would ask us whether we are demonstrating its principles of forgiveness in how we live our lives, whatever we may be doing. And this demonstration has nothing to do with our words and actions, and everything to do with our underlying thoughts and attitude. Are we choosing to remember in each moment that genuine happiness and peace come only from a recognition of our shared interest with all our brothers and sisters, rather than from a belief in separate, competing interests based on meeting our own personal needs? And the way we remember is to become vigilant for all of our ego motivations, so that we can recognize them and then choose a different teacher--the Holy Spirit--to guide us in our thinking. And that is the most powerful ministry we can embrace, for it will serve as a reminder to all our brothers and sisters that the same choice for peace lies within their own minds as well. Jesus invites us to be a part of his ministry by sharing in his peace. In his own words, \"Teach not that I died in vain. Teach rather that I did not die by demonstrating that I live in you\" (T- 11.VI.7:3-4). And we demonstrate this by recognizing that our only responsibility is to choose forgiveness. The extension of the peace that follows from this choice is not our concern (T- 16.II.1:3-5). We are not the ones who extend peace or persuade others to change their minds. The Holy Spirit does that through us, when we are His willing instruments. And again, we become his channels by getting ourselves out of the way, through practicing forgiveness. As for discerning genuine teachers of the Course, it is always the underlying content that defines the real teacher, regardless of the specific form they present. Just as we have described the nature of a real ministry being defined, not by the externals, but by the underlying thought of forgiveness, so any authentic teacher of the Course will be committed to a consistency across every level of thinking, with a willingness to step aside from the ego in every moment and let the love and gentle wisdom of the Holy Spirit flow through. This may not be easy for us to discern since, so long as we remain identified with our own egos, our own projections of guilt will interfere. But so long as we maintain a willingness to recognize our own ego, we can trust that our ability to discern the help we really need will become increasingly accessible to us (e.g., T- 11.V). The true teacher will be one who always directs us to our inner Teacher, with no interest in establishing himself or herself as our teacher."

    "text_input": "Q #688: In your response to #457, you say that it is a trap to believe the Holy Spirit's answer to our calls for help would be a change in the external situation. Yet you quote from \"The 'Hero' of the Dream:\" \"You judge effects, but He has judged their cause. And by His judgment are effects removed\" (T-27.VIII.9:4-5). This has confused me much of the time in my last eleven years of working with A Course in Miracles.  Further in the same answer you advise: \"And that does not mean that you should not do everything you possibly can to rectify the financial situation--consulting a financial advisor, etc.\" Does this mean you split up the situation and ask the Holy Spirit for help with finding peace and seek out a financial advisor to solve your money problem? Didn't Jesus help Helen Schucman find shoes and coats? Are we not worthy as well?  I am at my wits' end because after all this time I feel like it's such a futile effort. I hear no voice, I see no change in the destitution I perceive, and I have no way of knowing that Someone hears me at all. How do you ask Jesus and the Holy Spirit for help? How do you \"bring each terrible effect to Him that you may look together on its foolish cause and laugh with Him a while\" (T- 27.VIII.9:3). Please answer me and guide me to other sources of reading if possible.",
    "output": "The only reason we ever experience a sense of upset or lack, whatever external form it may seem to take in our lives, is that we believe we are unworthy of love (T-4.IV.7). And so we repeatedly make the unconscious, and at times perhaps conscious, choice to keep love out of our awareness. We believe there are many external things that we need and that we are unhappy because we don't have them. But they are all only symbols for the experience we all want--truly knowing that our guilt is not real and that we are loved without any reservation. And, believe it or not, that experience is in no way dependent on having any of our external needs met. When we bring each \"terrible effect\" to the Holy Spirit, you will notice that Jesus says that we will look together at the cause--the thought of guilt in our mind--and not the effects--the external situation in the world and, in particular, our thoughts and feelings about it. And His judgment is that the cause is silly, for our sin and guilt are not real (W-pI.156.6). When we share His perspective on the cause, all its effects--our fear and upset and concern--simply vanish. The external situation in the world may or may not change, but we will no longer be concerned about it, since in that moment our mind is healed and we have no needs. It is possible to have this experience of release in any instant, but it is our own fear of love that prevents us from accepting it all of the time. And we are fearful of love because there is no place for our limited self with all its seeming needs and desires in that place that reflects the boundless joy of the Infinite. Now there is nothing wrong with asking Jesus or the Holy Spirit for the specific things we think we need, as Helen did for a while, although if our requests seem to be answered, it will not really be because Jesus or the Holy Spirit have intervened in our lives and delivered some of the goodies we want, as Helen seemed to experience. (See a discussion of what is really happening in such situations in Absence From Felicity, the section in chapter 17 \"Helen and Jesus: The Illusion and the Reality,\" by Kenneth Wapnick.) But what Jesus is trying to help us see is that having such needs met does not address the underlying guilt in our mind, which we still believe is real and which is the real cause of such feelings as futility, desperation, and depression. So when we are not blocking the love, we may indeed find that some of our specific needs are met. But again it will have nothing to do with Jesus or the Holy Spirit but rather with our own decision to allow ourselves to experience love in a specific, limited form that we can accept without increasing our fear. Seeking out help in the world from those who offer help in the form you think you need, such as a financial advisor, a therapist, a doctor, a lawyer, etc., can be done in a state of peace if you have first asked for help from the only real Help in your mind. So this is not really an either-or situation in terms of who offers what kinds of help, but rather a way in which we can learn to approach all of our seeming challenges in the world in a peaceful way, remembering where the only real problem and its only solution lie--in our own mind, and turning there for help first before we return to our busy activities in the world (T-18.VII.7-8). Of course, this may be easy to describe, but it can be very difficult to put into practice. But again, it is only our own resistance to the experience of love, because we feel unworthy, that makes the most natural thing in all the world (T-7.XI.1:1-4; W-pI.41.8:1-3) seem difficult! In addition to the section from Absence from Felicity cited above, you may find the discussions about asking for specifics presented in #538 and #555 helpful in clarifying the process, as well as #86 on the power of the mind to project."

    "text_input": "Q #689: I have been a student of A Course in Miracles for twenty years and have never been able to help myself much. I just read it over and over and think that I am applying it, but I don't get results. For over a year I have had a painful condition in my shoulders, and the pain just doesn't go away. Recently I have been drawn to these statements about sickness in the manual: \"It is the choice of weakness, in the mistaken conviction that it is strength\" (M-5.I.1:5); \"One need but say, 'There is no gain at all to me in this' and he is healed\" (M-5.II.1:2). Could it be that I don't really know how to give up the sickness even though I keep saying all of the words on the page, and really think that I believe them?",
    "output": "Yes, more than likely that is what is going on. As this section in the manual goes on, Jesus explains why we will strenuously resist his teaching that sickness is a decision of the mind and has nothing to do with the body. Our acceptance of this, he advises us, \"will cost the whole world [we] see, for the world will never again appear to rule the mind\" (M-5.II.3:4), meaning we could no longer justify thinking that the world affects us in any way. That is a major shift, to put it mildly. Thus, he is not simply talking about getting rid of physical pain so that we can go on with our lives pain free. He is talking about a decision to change the very thought system in our minds that governs all our thinking and actions.You can see, then, why reading these words again and again, while a good start, will not alone do the trick. In the workbook, Jesus opens the lesson about wanting the peace of God by stating, \"To say these words is nothing. But to mean these words is everything\" (W-pI.185.1:1-2). That could well be said of the statements about sickness, too. Later in the workbook he tells us that acceptance of these truths is a process that unfolds in stages: 1) we first repeat statements again and again; 2) we then accept them, but with lots of reservations; 3) we move on to a more serious consideration of them; and finally 4) accept them fully without reservation (W-pII.284). In other words, in one part of our minds we are clearly aware of the radical changes we would have to make in our thinking if we were to accept fully what Jesus is teaching, and we are not entirely sure we want to go that far. We would much rather compromise with him and have him just fix things for us, so that we could carry on business as usual without so many encumbrances. That is fine, as long as we realize that when we do that we are only on the first rung of the ladder, and that he has invited us to go all the way to the top with him. Honesty with ourselves and him about this is terribly important, as is being gentle with ourselves and not judging ourselves for our fear and resistance. What you can do therefore is focus not on getting rid of the pain (although we hope you have sought medical advice and treatment), but on learning the important lesson that your inner state of peace is not conditional on your being without physical pain. That is what Jesus teaches throughout his course. The peace of God is permanent; it does not come and go depending on what is happening in our bodies and the world. Jesus means quite literally that we are not bodies; and how best to learn that than when we are most tempted to believe that is all we are. We are thus asked to learn how to identify with the peace that is our true Identity as God's creation, while not denying that we are experiencing something else as real. That means far more than we realize, which is why we need help from a gentle Teacher. It is a gradual process of getting more deeply into our minds where our secret purpose is concealed, as the two statements to which you have been attracted reveal."

    "text_input": "Q #690: I am having great difficulty with one phrase that keeps recurring in A Course in Miracles and it has shown up in #453, which centers on the statement, \"Forgive your Father it was not His Will that you be crucified\" (T-24.III.8:13). The troublesome statement is: \"That is why we have to forgive God; He is not part of our insanity ... \" In the common use of forgive, I would forgive someone for some wrong that they have done to me and I hold no grudge against them. How can I forgive God? He has not done anything to my detriment. I find this use very confusing.",
    "output": "What He has done \"wrong\" is that He does not notice us--the ultimate affront! God--the true God--is completely unaware of our existence, and therefore is not involved in our lives to bless our many sacrifices and efforts done in the name of goodness and innocence, and to justify our judgments of those who have treated us unfairly. Jesus teaches us it is insane to think that for one to win another must lose (T-25.VII), and that it is possible for love to be exclusive. But these principles are at the core of the thought system that governs our lives, and, indeed, are the very source of our existence as individuals. God, as perfect Oneness and Love, could not give rise to this insanity, which means it is not real. Our existence as individuals consequently is exposed as not linked to God in any way. Suffering, pain, and death, as well as heroism and triumphs are not His Will. A massive system of deception and lies is thus uncovered, shattering the foundation of our existence and the universe in which we appear to live, and forcing us to face what we swore we would never again look upon (T-19.IV-D.6:1). Everything that goes on in our personal worlds as well as the world at large is our will, not God's. The implications of this recognition are staggering, which become the focus of Jesus' teachings throughout his course. It seems far more tolerable to have God's blessings on our struggles and suffering, justifying our perception of sin and victimizers \"out there,\" rather than to have to accept responsibility for all of it ourselves (as the one Son). It is for this that we need to forgive God. He gives no credence or validity to what is so real and meaningful to us: \"Not one Thought of His makes any sense at all within this world. And nothing that the world believes as true has any meaning in His Mind at all\" (T- 25.VII.3:3-4). Therefore, since does God not support our thought system, He does not support us, either, as we know ourselves. What means so much to us is nothing to God. The same is true for Jesus, as well. He sees everything of the body and our individual identity as meaningless--all the events of our lives, which seem to have so much significance, are without meaning. We are presented with this in the very first lesson of the workbook, and many times in many ways throughout the rest of the lessons--Lesson 93, for example: \"The self you made is not the Son of God. Therefore, this self does not exist at all. And anything it seems to do and think means nothing. It is neither bad nor good. It is unreal, and nothing more than that\" (W-pI.93.5:1-5). This realization is bound to stir up some profound emotions in us--fear, anger, confusion, etc. Who likes to be told that they are unreal? This is not the end of the story, though, because at some point in our work with the Course, we will find ourselves relieved to be unburdened of our guilty secret. We will be glad to have been proven wrong in all we thought to be the truth. But before reaching that stage comes the anger that God did not buy our story. It is not all that pleasant to be caught in a lie, and this is especially devastating when the deception involves our very identity. We suddenly become aware of the massive self-deception we have engaged in, and without the help of Jesus and his course, or some other loving reflection of truth outside our thought system, we would have a most difficult time coping with this situation and all the guilt and fear it arouses. All that supported us now is revealed as but strategic ways of keeping us from the truth about ourselves and reality--defenses against the truth. It is as if the bottom has fallen out. But Jesus helps us realize we need only have the willingness to change our choice of teachers in our minds from the ego to him, and peace will be restored in our awareness. We are merely awakening from a nightmare dream of separation from our Creator and Source."

    "text_input": "Q #691: Discerning the Voice of Holy Spirit is a most important but very ambiguous issue in practicing A Course in Miracles. Helen heard this Voice clearly and unambiguously. I'm inclined to think that many lessons of the workbook took this capability of Helen into account. The designed short period of practice (one year) reinforces that in my opinion. One year seems to be too short for radically reversing the thought system of the average person. What made Helen so sensitive and attuned to this Voice? Could we be helped by inquiring into this, so that we might develop this capability?",
    "output": "Kenneth talks about Helen's \"hearing\" ability in his biography of Helen, Absence from Felicity. Her hearing was somewhat \"rusty\" at first, he reports, but then the interferences that were there initially cleared up and the Voice was heard in its purity from then on. The lessons began about three and a half years after the scribing commenced in 1965. What made Helen \"so sensitive and attuned to this Voice\" was her willingness to set aside her ego completely and be in her right mind. She did not regard this as anything exceptional that she alone could do. She always told people who were tempted to see her as spiritually blessed that they could do exactly what she did; all that was required was the willingness to set aside their ego, if only for an instant. The abstract presence of love is part of everyone's mind and hearing the Voice is only one form in which that love can be experienced. Each of us will experience it in the form we can best relate to and accept without excessive fear. The form is illusory and will fade when enough fear subsides to allow the full experience of that love into one's awareness. Therefore, it would not make sense to make the form into a big deal. Moreover, there is no way of our knowing where we are on our Atonement path, or where anyone else is, either. Comparisons therefore are not likely to be spiritually beneficial. Learning and practicing this Course is carried out in the context of the relationship between the student and the Holy Spirit or Jesus. The events and circumstances of our lives are meaningful, thus, only to the extent that they reflect back to us whether we have chosen the ego or Jesus as our teacher. Finally, there certainly are lessons and parts of lessons that assume an advanced spiritual state, yet there are many others that explicitly refer to a process of learning and practice that could extend over many years, even lifetimes. And then at the very end of the workbook Jesus tells us that \"this course is a beginning, not an end\" (W-ep.1:1). Similarly, toward the end of the text, the beginnings of Chapters 30 and 31, Jesus is basically telling Helen that she is moving along well but has not yet reached the end of her process. The ability to hear the Voice of the Holy Spirit is simply the process of learning to let go of one's ego, as Jesus so clearly states in this passage, to single out one of many such passages: \"You can defend your specialness, but never will you hear the Voice for God beside it. They speak a different language and they fall on different ears\" (T- 24.II.5:1-2). That was the essence of Helen's process and is ours as well."

This too wouldn't matter though it may continue to disappoint yesterday's salesman and induce unnecessary busyness into today's buyer. Ultimately, neither the salesman nor I can be hurt no matter what the decision; so I guess I'm asking for clarification of the meaning of \"hurt\" in this context.",
    "output": "It probably is safe to say that when Jesus was talking about this issue to Helen, the scribe of A Course in Miracles, he did not have telemarketers or other solicitors in mind. Common sense dictates that we not respond to every request made by a salesperson. On the other hand, an egoless person may be guided to buy what has been offered because the interaction is helpful to the seller's Atonement process, not because there is any need for the item. But that advanced state is not what Jesus is referring to in these passages. He is talking about an immediate, strong reaction of opposition--a stubborn refusal to even consider the request. That extreme reaction means something is going on beneath the surface that needs to be looked at. With telemarketers, we can quickly but kindly decline the call, and that would be the end of it, just as we might decline solicitors outside a supermarket or other kind of store. There is no issue."

    "text_input": "Q #693: Where is evil? Does it exist in all of us? Does it exist only in our perceived enemy? If our enemy no longer existed would evil follow? If evil no longer existed would our perceived enemy follow? Why do we destroy to honor our faith in God? Why do we bargain to gain more  good than the evil we allow? Is evil fear? Is fear evil? Does fear and love control all we do? Do we have control on deciding between them?",
    "output": "These simple and direct statements from the text are the foundation for responding to your queries about evil: \"The truth is true. Nothing else matters, nothing else is real, and everything beside it is not there\" (T-14.II.3:3-4). This is another way of stating the fundamental principle of A Course in Miracles, found in the Introduction to the text: \"Nothing real can be threatened. Nothing unreal exists\" (T-in.2:2-3).What is true and real is our Identity as God's innocent Son. Everything else is part of our experience in the illusion, which rises in our awareness when we choose to believe the separation is not only real, but a sin, deserving of punishment. This fundamental belief of the ego thought system breathes life into every thought of evil, pain, hatred, and despair that darkens our lives in the nightmare of \"life\" apart from God. The dream itself may be considered \"evil\" in the sense that its source (the thought of separation) is an attack on God and on His Son. The way into the dream is to deny God and our oneness with Him, choosing the illusion of the body and the world instead. Jesus gives us a clear exposition of the ego's substitution for reality: \"Sin is the home of all illusions, which but stand for things imagined, issuing from thoughts that are untrue. They are the \"proof\" that what has no reality is real. Sin \"proves\" God's Son is evil; timelessness must have an end; eternal life must die. And God Himself has lost the Son He loves, with but corruption to complete Himself, His Will forever overcome by death, love slain by hate, and peace to be no more\" (W-pII.4.3:1-4). Not a great place to be. Although it is not real, evil enters the illusion as a haunting force following the mind's choice to identify with the ego. However, it is a force with no power, because it is an effect, not a cause. That is not to say that once we believe we are in the world as bodies we do not have some experiences that seem pleasant and others we call \"evil.\" This is in keeping with the ego's endless array of qualifications to differentiate every experience in the dream. We are not asked to deny these distinctions, but to recognize them as the ego's scheme to make the dream real, and then acknowledge that they are powerless. As an ego concept, evil is fear's product. Fearful that God will punish His Son who has denied Him by choosing separation instead of oneness, the Son invents a myriad of evil \"monsters\" who are out to get him; just as a child believes his imagined monsters are poised to attack: \"A madman's dreams are frightening, and sin appears indeed to terrify. And yet what sin perceives is but a childish game\" (W-pII.4.4:1-2). The world filled with evil, fear, sin, guilt, enemies, danger and attack is the madman's dream. Once we are caught in this thought system, it does not matter where evil lurks, nor in whom. The \"good\" and \"evil\" of the ego are the same because they serve the same purpose: to keep us rooted in the belief in separation. \"Escape\" from this system is possible only by learning to identify with the memory of God's Love that remains in part of our mind. The paths may be different, but everyone will eventually accept this Love. For students of the Course, it is by bringing every ego misperception to the light of the Holy Spirit's true perception, allowing His interpretation of our experience in the world to replace ours, that we are gradually freed of the ego's \"evil shadow.\" This requires only our willingness to see every experience as a projection of the guilt in our minds for having chosen to identify with the ego, as we mentioned earlier. Though we are wrong about our ego identity, we are not condemned to the punishment of evil forces, nor have we succeeded in changing reality by our mad imaginings: \"Correction has one answer to all this, and to the world that rests on this: You but mistake interpretation for the truth. And you are wrong. But a mistake is not a sin, nor has reality been taken from its throne by your mistakes. God reigns forever, and His laws alone prevail upon you and upon the world. His Love remains the only thing there is. Fear [evil] is illusion, for you are like Him\" (M-18.3:6-12). No destruction honors God. In fact, God does not require that we honor Him at all, but the ego's God does. And since the ego's God is a destroyer (T-23.II.7:8; T-26.VII.7), to honor Him is to be like Him. Yet the only possible honor we could offer God would be to accept that we are as He created us; nothing more than that, but also nothing less. The non-dualistic theology of the Course teaches that God does not know His Son as separate from Himself; He is only oneness. Our split minds cannot truly understand this, but we can learn what it is not: it is not fear, evil, or destruction. Our goal in studying the Course is not to try to avoid, abolish, or transform evil, but to undo our belief in separation through forgiveness, so that eventually we will forget our evil dreams and remember only God's Love. The only decision we need make is between the ego's lie of sin, guilt and fear, and the Holy Spirit's message that we remain innocent, as we were created. Nothing has happened to destroy the Love the Father extends to His Son. That is what we seek to remember. \"Nothing else matters, nothing else is real\" (T-14.II.3:4)."

    "text_input": "Q #694: Is A Course in Miracles true? And does it really matter? Now, I'm aware of the teaching that we must believe everything the Course teaches one hundred percent, presumably, for it to then be able to deliver upon its one and only promise. But does it matter whether or not any of it is actually true?",
    "output": "The short and simple answer to your question is: the Course is part of the illusion and therefore, cannot be the truth: \"Nothing unreal (anything outside of Heaven) exists\" (T-in.2:3). On the other hand, its content, which is a loving message from Jesus, our teacher who represents the part of the mind that remembers the truth, is a reflection of the truth. The Course is also \"true\" in the sense that it accurately describes for us the dynamics of the ego's insanity, tells us we have been mistaken in choosing to believe the thought of separation, and teaches us how to undo this thought through forgiveness. On some level, we recognize that the Course's teaching is right about our ego shenanigans, and, most importantly, we resonate to what it tells us about our true Identity as God's innocent Son. In other words: \"it rings true.\" This explains why we find ourselves in the Course, especially in poignant passages that express what we have always sensed but have been unable to articulate: \"This world you seem to live in is not home to you. And somewhere in your mind you know that this is true. A memory of home keeps haunting you, as if there were a place that called you to return, although you do not recognize the voice, nor what it is the voice reminds you of. Yet still you feel an alien here, from somewhere all unknown\" (W-pI.182.1:1-5; italics ours). If we choose the Course as our path, we would do well to ask ourselves what part of its teaching do we suspect is not true. Perhaps a close examination of our doubts about the Course will reveal that when in doubt, we are actually disbelieving the whole thing. Though we may try very hard to keep the parts we like, and discard those that make us uncomfortable, we do, in fact, throw the baby out with the bath water. As you mention, Jesus tells us in the text: \"This course will be believed entirely or not at all\" (T-22.II.7:4). This is because the mind holds only one of two possible thoughts. It chooses either the ego's thought of separation or the memory of God's Love, symbolized by the Holy Spirit. In the same section he goes on to say: \"Reason will tell you that there is no middle ground where you can pause uncertainly, waiting to choose between the joy of Heaven and the misery of hell. Until you choose Heaven, you are in hell and misery\" (7:7- 8). We can at least agree that if there is a Heaven/God, this world is not it. If what is not Heaven/God is hell, it follows that this is hell. Moreover, if Heaven/God is true, this world/hell is not true. That is what we do not want to hear, because our greatest fear is that what we believe about ourselves (that we are bodies in the world) is not true. From this fear comes our resistance to accepting the Course's teaching, which takes the form of doubts about its veracity. On some level we know that our baby (specialness, the body, the world) will have to go out with the bath water. We cannot drag Heaven into hell, we cannot make the illusion true, and the separation cannot be real. These are all variations of the same theme: \" ... truth is true\" (T- 14.II.2:1), whether we believe it or not. It is this simplicity of the Course's teaching that we find hard to believe and to accept: \"Nothing is so alien to you as the simple truth, and nothing are you less inclined to listen to. The contrast between what is true and what is not is perfectly apparent, yet you do not see it\" (T-14.II.2:5-6). Apparently Jesus thinks his message is true, so it may be a good idea for us to take his word for it. Ultimately the truth reflected in the Course will come to every mind in some form: \"There are many thousands of other forms, all with the same outcome\" (M-1.4:2). Jesus speaks his message to all of us: \"We speak today for everyone who walks this world, for he is not at home ... The home he seeks can not be made by him. There is no substitute for Heaven\" (W-pI.182.3:1,5,6). Thus, it is the world, and the ego that made it, that is not true."

    "text_input": "Q #695: This is about your answer to #465 regarding T-12.4. A Course in Miracles teaches us that the world is a reflection of your mind (\"the outside picture of an inward condition\" [T- 21.in.1:5), why would someone ask a highly enlightened being to do something outrageous? Does that mean that someone like Sai Baba could never be asked an outrageous question? Second, if my mind is free from guilt then how could someone even ask for something \"outrageous?\" A guilt free mind wouldn't reflect guilt even in the form of a question. I thought that when you \"get it\" it won't even show up. That is why I find this to be contradictory of the teaching of love or fear, light or dark; if they are polarities then how could love and fear be present at the same time",
    "output": "First, Jesus is directing this teaching to unhealed minds, those that are still projecting guilt. A guilt-free mind, as you say, would never attack or feel attacked. Within the dream, a healed mind could be the object of an attack by someone else, as was the case with Jesus who perceived that others were attacking him, but did not himself experience it as an attack. It could be for a teaching purpose that a healed mind would choose to be in that kind of situation. As an example of what Jesus is teaching, let us say that you insist that I go to the store to buy something you need. I immediately lash out at you and angrily refuse to go, saying, \"That's outrageous! The nerve of you to insist that I go to the store for you. Go yourself, and quit bothering me!\" Jesus is talking about that kind of extreme reaction to another person's request. If I had switched from my wrong mind to my right mind, I would not have judged your insistence that I go to the store for you as outrageous, and then attacked you in return, for I would have recognized what you were really asking for: to be saved from your self-hatred and fear of punishment by God for your \"sin\" of separating from Him. You were asking for love, and I would have responded with love to that request by my inner peace and non-opposition. The specific form that love would have taken would not be of concern to me; that is, I would do what you asked or not do it. There would have been no sense of being imposed on or deprived of my own needs. That is what Jesus means in saying \"no 'outrageous' requests can be made of one who recognizes what is valuable and wants to accept nothing else\" (T-12.4:8). Jesus is helping us to become clear about \"the 'what' and the 'how' of salvation\" (T-12.5:3). Your insistence that I go to the store means that you believe your salvation lies in getting what you want. My forceful opposition would mean that I believe salvation lies in my not giving you what you want. That is the problem Jesus is identifying in this kind of interaction. I, as an unhealed mind, have simply forgotten that my salvation as well as yours lies in the power of our minds to choose against the ego and for the Holy Spirit's thought system of forgiveness."

One of the original members of the group was vehemently opposed to letting the new person in. This person cited the Holy Spirit as her guide and said she felt that it would ruin the intimacy of the current group. This is not the first time that the Holy Spirit has been used to defend a position and I remain confused. I am having a hard time forgiving this group member for insisting on this type of control, yet I am constantly reminded of my own control issues and feel frozen as to what to do. My search for help from the Holy Spirit keeps guiding me to confront this member of the group with honesty and compassion but I can't tell if I'm doing this so I can have my way. Can you offer guidance that can get my head on straight? I am open to your being the voice of the Holy Spirit for me since my ego is being particularly loud at this time.",
    "output": "Before you can get any kind of clarity about what would be the most kind, loving and helpful way to respond to this situation for everyone involved, it is helpful first to remember that whatever we experience as the outcome of any decision we make must be what we want. In the Course's own words, \"I choose the feelings I experience, and I decide upon the goal I would achieve. And everything that seems to happen to me I ask for, and receive as I have asked\" (T- 21.II.2:4-5). And so if conflict is what we seem to be experiencing, it can only be that conflict is what we have chosen. And the seemingly external situation is never the cause of the conflict. The choice to see ourselves as separate from love is. The so-called problem in the world, no matter how holy or important the issues may seem, is only there to distract us from the underlying problem in the mind and to convince us that the external situation is what needs our attention. But so long as we keep the focus outside our mind, our ego will be the architect of the solution, regardless of how appropriate and kind the form of the intervention may seem. For we will not have addressed the guilt in our mind that is fueling the conflict. Now this is not to say that the other group member's invocation of the Holy Spirit as the authority behind her opposition to your decision is justified. All of us are looking for a celestial ally to support our ego-based choices. But if you see yourself as the one who needs to offer correction to your brother or sister's ill-conceived opinions, you will have fallen into the ego's favorite trap of making the error real, preferably in someone else, as if there were truly something serious that needed fixing (T-9.III.6). The inner work of releasing our own guilt by recognizing in our conflict our own call for help is all that we are ever responsible for. And it is only from that place of perfect honesty with ourselves that the Holy Spirit can help us see in our brother's or sister's conflict that same call for help (T-12.I.6:10-11; 7:1-5). But once we accept forgiveness for ourselves for desiring conflict and attack, the external problem will no longer seem like a serious concern, and a helpful solution at the level of form may present itself. Perhaps you will then say something to the group member, or perhaps you won't. But if you do say something, you will have no investment in being heard or in seeing the other person change, for that will no longer be your concern. You will recognize that your only function is to accept forgiveness for yourself so that, through that acceptance, you may be an instrument of forgiveness for others as well."

    "text_input": "Q #697: I read your answers about the sex drive and special relationships. Although I understand the metaphysics of A Course in Miracles, I sometimes find the sex impulse is overwhelming and therefore I might in those vulnerable moments go to the extent of soliciting call girls despite my being married with kids. I try not to make things a big deal and that's how I have repeatedly committed the same mistake over again. I know what is right from wrong and in those dark moments I ask the Holy Spirit for help but I guess that I choose not to listen and do what I will. How do I wean myself out of this when I enjoy what I do--the rush of adrenaline and the secret guilt The girls I treat with respect and dignity--an oxymoron--while they are being used as objects of pleasure in the last analysis. How do I apply the Course to this practical problem?",
    "output": "The world makes distinctions between socially acceptable and socially unacceptable forms of using others, classifying the latter as wrong, sinful or even criminal. And it allows us to think that guilt is only associated with some forms of using others, but not other forms. The Course's purpose is to help us see that all ego-based decisions to meet our needs at the expense of others cause us pain and reinforce our guilt. If we could really get the connection between the thought of separation implicit in self-interest and the pain that follows, we would soon learn to choose against the ego. But we still believe that some of our ego choices bring us more pleasure than pain. The ego wants us to think of our actions and behavior in such moralistic terms as right or wrong, good or bad, with guilt always accompanying our wrong, bad actions. Jesus is encouraging us instead to think of our thoughts and decisions as either helpful or hurtful, wise or foolish, with unnecessary pain rather than guilt as the consequence of foolish, hurtful choices. (See #637ii for an in-depth discussion of the Course's focus on thought rather than behavior.) So rather than thinking that you know what is right and what is wrong in the situation you describe, and that you keep doing the wrong thing, it would be more helpful to consider that you are simply making the more foolish, hurtful decision. But not just when you choose to solicit call girls, but whenever you decide to put your own needs above others, whether it be your family or anyone else. Now of course some actions run the risk of having greater negative consequences in the world's terms than others, which nicely plays into the ego's insistence that there is a hierarchy among illusions (T-23.II.2:3; T-26.VII.6:5). But all guilt is the same and it does not come from what we do with our bodies but only from what we think with our minds. So seeking sexual satisfaction outside your marriage is not the cause of the guilt in your mind but an effect. And its purpose, which you keep hidden from yourself, is to distract you from recognizing where the real problem lies--the choice to see yourself as separate from love. Yet this is the decision that leads all of us to believe that we need to seek for satisfaction outside ourselves, in stolen moments of pleasure which the ego seduces us into seeing as more pleasurable simply because they are stolen. And that foolish reasoning lies at the foundation of the ego's thought system, predicated as it is on the belief that the scraps of \"love\" we could steal from God are better that the complete and total Love He offers us freely (T-1.V.3:3). You mention trying not to make your infidelities into a big deal, but the problem is, in your own mind, they already are. And the goal is not to be able to continue to engage in hurtful activities without making a big deal of them, but rather to come to a recognition that they are not really the problem and that to continue to feel guilty about the external actions guarantees that you'll never address the underlying, inner problem and see it differently. It is true that, as egos, we are all selfish and concerned about meeting our own needs at everyone else's expense. This is simply the nature of the ego thought system. But despite the selfishness that is at its roots, what Jesus is asking us to recognize is that it's not a sin, it's not evil. It may be foolish and hurtful and unkind, both to ourselves and to others in our life. But it is not a sin. It is our belief that it is sin rather than merely a mistake that keeps us caught in the repetition of any self-destructive pattern. Without the guilt we impose on our decisions, but rather with a thoughtful, nonjudgmental examination of what we've been choosing, seeing it only as error and not as sin, we will find it easier to make the choice for a different Teacher within our mind (T-19.III.1-3). And the most helpful and kind behavior will naturally follow. You may find the discussion of compulsive sexual behavior in #598 and sexual fidelity in #417 of help as well."

    "output": "As decision-making minds we are always choosing only between what is real (therefore valuable) and nothingness (therefore valueless). If we choose to pursue the ego's goals (specialness, separation, individuality, sin, etc.), that choice will be expressed through our choices in our everyday lives. The choice for the ego gets denied and buried in our minds, and we then think we are making meaningful choices in the world. When we feel guilty about a choice, that is telling us we must have chosen the ego first, which means from that point on all we have been choosing between are different forms of nothingness--what is valueless."

Jesus mentions that the ego and the spirit are unaware of each other and the body is nothing. How relative are the calibration levels regarding the spirit? I find his work very informative and it helps put the ego/mind/Self in line with the way Jesus explains truth in A Course in Miracles.",
    "output": "We do not comment on the work of other teachers, but we can address your question about the relationship among body, mind and spirit. The Course teaches that the mind is not contained in the body/brain. Spirit is real, the body is not. (See T-6.IV.5.) As you mention, the body is nothing. However, while belief in the body's reality is maintained, it is used either by the ego or the Holy Spirit: \"The ego uses the body for attack, for pleasure and for pride ... The Holy Spirit sees the body only as a means of communication\" (T-6.V-A.5:3,5). We are told in the Course that our problem is that we have identified with the ego, and thereby with the body, and the correction is for us to learn to identify with the mind. This does not involve levels, but rather a simple choice between the thought system of the ego based on belief in the separation, or the thought system of the Holy Spirit based on the truth that separation from God is impossible. The choice is then communicated to other minds through the body, reinforcing belief in either the ego or the Holy Spirit. That is what is meant when Jesus tells us we are always teaching. There are no varying degrees in this teaching/communication. Either the ego or the Holy Spirit is chosen, and then communicated in some form. Both thoughts cannot be held in the mind at the same time. Thus the line you refer to: \"The ego and the spirit do not know each other\" (T-4.VI.4:1). By recognizing the thoughts, judgments, and feelings that arise in our interactions and activities, we teach ourselves, as well as others, the choice we have made in our minds of which we are not aware. The mind thus communicates to itself through the body, which is the only useful purpose the body serves. When the body is at the service of the Holy Spirit (by the choice made in the mind), it is not driven by the needs that arise from identification with the ego. We must remember, however, the fundamental Course teaching that action occurs only in the mind, where learning resides: \"...only the mind can create ... correction belongs at the thought level\" (T-2.V.1:7). Practicing the Course, therefore, involves focusing our attention on our thoughts and judgments, rather than body impulses. When the mind chooses to believe in separation, the choice is defended by judgments and grievances. The inevitable negative effects of this choice (deep pain and misery) can then be used as further proof that the separation/body is real, or as an opportunity to see them for what they are (effects of a choice), so another choice can be made. By the same token, experiencing the deep peace and quiet that results from choosing the Holy Spirit strengthens identity with the His thought system, which heals the mind of the thought of separation. The body is then freed of ego driven impulses, although it need not be what we consider a \"healthy\" body. The content of the mind is unaffected by the physical condition of the body. When the mind's healing is our only goal, the body will serve the Holy Spirit's purpose no matter what form it takes: \"...it [the body] becomes a beautiful lesson in communion, which has value until communion is\" (T- 8.VII.3:4)."

At the time, I was working 60-70 hours a week and found it impossible to combine both. 2003 was a bad year: I lost my job, my beloved pet, and my mother. My father fell apart; my resentment toward my sibling intensified dramatically; my depressions returned with vengeance. I tried to deal with everything the best I could. Needless to say, my best was not my best at all.  Yet my attachment to the Course is creating a financial dilemma. Since I lost my job, I've been basically living off my savings of which not much is left by now. I need to go back, but I am afraid that being a workaholic by nature, I will again get so involved with work, there will be very little room left for A Course in Miracles. I read your answer to #169 several times. On an intellectual level I am beginning to get sparks of understanding about the shift from form to content; effect to cause. But on the practical level, I am in a limbo. I hope very much to get your answer and your guidance that would allow me to handle this situation as peacefully as I can.",
    "output": "There are a few more aspects of your situation that you might want to look at to help break up the log jam. It seems that you have no choice regarding whether to work or not. If you need the money, then you have to go back to work if there is no other source of income in your life. But you can do it differently this time. Do you recall Jesus' helpful reminder in that lovely final chapter of the text, \"Choose Once Again\"?: \"Trials are but lessons that you failed to learn presented once again, so where you made a faulty choice before you now can make a better one, and thus escape all pain that what you chose before has brought to you\" (T-31.VIII.3.1-2). If in your wrong mind you were using work to keep you from the quiet peace that defines you in your right mind, you can now look upon your return to work as an opportunity to \"choose once again.\" You can decide that you will see your job primarily as a means of learning that you are as God created you, which means that you will look first at your conviction that you are not as God created you; that is, that you are \"a workaholic by nature,\" a victim of your makeup, which your ego would tell you can't be helped--it's just who you are! Jesus sees you differently and invites you to join him, confidently acknowledging with him that \"the images you make cannot prevail against what God Himself would have you be. Be never fearful of temptation, then, but see it as it is; another chance to choose again, and let Christ's strength prevail in every circumstance and every place you raised an image of yourself before. For what appears to hide the face of Christ is powerless before His majesty, and disappears before His holy sight\" (T-31.VIII.4.1-3). The idea would be to consider this not only for yourself, but for everyone else you associate with as well. In relating to others this way (in your mind, not verbally), you would be practicing forgiveness by seeing that we all share a common purpose. In focusing on this new content, your job would no longer be an impediment to your learning the Course. It would be just the opposite. Many students think--erroneously--that they must be off in seclusion somewhere with nothing but the Course in front of them, or be with \"Course- minded\" friends and colleagues all the time in order to study and practice effectively. Nothing could be further from what Jesus intended his course to be. This course is best learned in the midst of our daily routines--work, family, civic responsibilities, etc., for in those circumstances we, thankfully, are presented with innumerable opportunities to have reflected back to us what thought system we have chosen; if we are not aware of that, we have no basis for changing our minds. And in learning to forgive ourselves when we discover that three, six, or thirty-six hours have passed since we last thought of the lesson for the day, we are learning perhaps the most important lesson of all: that the tiny, mad idea had no effect: Jesus' love for us is not lessened one iota because we forgot all about him. If we truly, truly believe that, we will be saving thousands of years on our Atonement path, to use Jesus' perspective of time. And if you could also practice raising yourself above the \"battleground\" (in your mind)--all of the victim-victimizer situations and tragedies of 2003--and look back down on it through the eyes of forgiveness, which is what it means to join with Jesus or the Holy Spirit, you would recognize the ego's purpose in having your life be filled with that kind of pain. You would see yourself as a figure on that battleground, weak and battered, depressed and despairing--exactly where the ego wants you to wind up, because then you are obsessed with your body, problems, and tragedies, and the love and peace of Jesus are nowhere in sight. But above the battleground (in your mind), you would be able to re-evaluate your acceptance of this ego purpose and know that another choice is available. Finally, it may be helpful to you to work with a kind therapist who is skilled in dealing with addictions such as workaholism. This compromise approach is actually recommended by Jesus to ensure that we will be gentle with ourselves and not deny our bodily and psychological needs as we do our inner work of learning and practicing forgiveness. (See T-2.IV.3-5.) Other students have had similar work-related concerns, which are voiced in Questions #74 and #246."

    "text_input": "Q #701: I gave my special relationship--a friendship--over to the Holy Spirit a while ago, and have been dealing with problems as they have been developing as best I can according to A Course in Miracles. I recently discovered that my friend also has a severe problem with compulsive lying. This man was severely abused as a child, and I had felt, up until now, that given someone who would/could show him unconditional love, maybe he could come to know the Love of God, and learn that love and forgiveness really could exist for him. It seems that the more loving and forgiving I am to him, the worse he becomes and the more and harder he tests in order to make me go away and prove that the world and everyone in it is as horrible as he believes it to be. I'm beginning to feel that I have taken on a task that is beyond me, and that maybe I should leave the relationship all together. Does the Course have any suggestions as to how I might handle this predicament?",
    "output": "There is nothing in the Course that would tell you to leave the relationship or to stay. What it teaches is that before you make a decision you become aware of whether you are in a state of peace or conflict and whether you have any investment in either staying or leaving. It is true that your friend could be helped by recognizing and accepting unconditional love; that is true of all us, whatever our emotional/psychological state might be. But you can be most helpful by focusing on your own mind, which means, in part, letting go of any investment you might have in your friend accepting your help. Perhaps he is not ready to take this step right now--there is no way of your knowing. Therefore, just set your ego aside as best you can for an instant and allow the love in your right mind to direct your thinking. It seems as if you have tried to do this; but it also seems as if you may have skipped some steps. Yes, compulsive lying is ultimately a \"cry for help\"; but that does not mean it should be tolerated. This reflects the Course distinction between form and content: the distinction between behavior and the content in the mind. Thus, as we have often said in our answers, being kind and forgiving (the content) does not preclude firmness and discipline: you can be loving and peaceful while at the same time holding firmly to standards of acceptable behavior. When you are in your right mind, having set aside your ego for an instant, you will automatically do what is most loving to you and your friend, even if that is not apparent at the moment."

I feel like I am making my career decisions based on being in others' lives in a meaningful way, and want not to be associated with those who are only out to \"make money and don't give a damn about others.\" (My thoughts, i.e. judgments) I know that I have no way of knowing how I can help others or \"the role that is best for me,\" as Jesus says but I cannot stop second-guessing the Holy Spirit. Can you comment on this?",
    "output": "The Course teaches that the only difference we need to make in the world is to allow our minds to be healed by the Holy Spirit through the process of forgiveness, which is what is meant by accepting the Atonement (see: T-2.V.4-5; M-7.3; M-18.4). Although this is ultimately good news, many times it seems it would be easier to change the world than to change our minds about it, or about anything for that matter. That is because, choosing to believe in separation and identifying with the body entails a strong attachment to specialness and to the ego's interpretation of everything in the world. That is why the Course asks that we question everything: \"To learn this course requires willingness to question every value that you hold\" (T- 24.in.2:1). This includes what we think are the needs of the world, along with the ways it could and should be changed. Since we do not know what else to do, we have the Course to tell us. We are asked to look at the judgments about careers, people's needs, those who don't give a damn, and those who do, and see in these judgments the opportunity to apply forgiveness as the Course teaches. That is the \"career\" of a student of the Course. Business is very good indeed, since we have numerous opportunities in our lives to forgive ourselves for our misperceptions. Whatever work or associations you choose can be given to the Holy Spirit to be used for the purpose of healing through forgiveness. In this way, your life and the world become a classroom for learning. This process involves recognizing how much we think we know what is best for ourselves, as well as for everyone else. In our identity as spirit the world is alien to us, and is the domain of the ego. We are very familiar with its dynamics. We are also very resourceful in identifying and solving its problems (or at least trying to). Everything we think we know is based on the ego's interpretation, and is the source of second guessing the Holy Spirit. For, as bad as it is, we do like being masters and mistresses of the universe. However, considering the disastrous results of following the ego's plan for the world, it seems reasonable to second guess the ego's decisions, as long as we're second guessing. It is worth our while and our little willingness to ask if the ego has ever given us what we truly sought, or even what it promised. In light of the painful effects of siding with the ego and being \"right,\" Jesus poses some very helpful questions: \"Under the circumstances, would it not be more desirable to have been wrong, even apart from the fact that you were wrong? (T-13.IV.3:1), and \"Do you prefer that you be right or happy?\" (T-29.VII.1:9). It may be helpful to keep these questions in mind when choosing whose guidance to follow in making any decisions. Knowing our resistance to shifting from the familiarity of the ego's guidance to the Holy Spirit's, Jesus asks for just a \"little willingness\" (T-18.IV). Second guessing may be a good opportunity to remember that we do not know and, after putting forth our doubts, to ask the Holy Spirit to correct our mistaken perceptions about the world. Whatever doubts arise, or however many times we think we know what to do, we can simply return to the practice of forgiveness and remember Jesus' promise: \"All that is given you is for release; the sight, the vision and the inner Guide all lead you out of hell with those you love beside you, and the universe with them\" (T-31.VII.7:7). What more could there be to offer the world, when Jesus' love offers the rest?"

    "text_input": "Q #703: What is the view of A Course in Miracles on black magic/voodoo? Specifically the belief that another can harm you through the use of black magic. Can another control or guide your thought to cause you physical harm?",
    "output": "Jesus tells us in the text: \"If you will recognize that all the attack you perceive is in your own mind and nowhere else, you will at last have placed its source, and where it begins it must end. For in this same place also lies salvation\" (T-12.III.10:1-2). This is the foundation of the Course's teaching on forgiveness and the answer to your question. No one can control or guide another's thought to cause harm to the body. The mind that chooses to believe either the ego or the Holy Spirit is the only source of our experience in the dream. When the mind chooses to identify with the body, it attacks itself. The attack is a denial of the true identity of God's Son as mind, and is therefore an attack on God. The inevitable guilt that follows this attack is projected on to the body. Identification with the body, which is alien to the mind's natural condition as spirit, is the real source of all pain, anxiety, and every form of suffering that the body experiences. The mind has filled the entire physical universe with weapons to defend the choice for separation, and convince itself that the body and the world are real. The arsenal includes both positive and negative external agents that have been given power over the body's physical condition, and seem to have the ability to give peace or take it away. When the mind chooses to identify with the ego rather than the Holy Spirit, the choice is expressed by an \"agreement\" with something (germs, viruses, car accidents), or someone (doctors, voodoo masters, politicians) in the world of form to be the seeming cause of all types of physical, emotional, or psychological distress. That is the ego's version of cause and effect, and is the magic principle as Jesus explains it in the Course: \"The body cannot create, and the belief that it can, a fundamental error, produces all physical symptoms ... The whole distortion that made magic rests on the belief that there is a creative ability in matter which the mind cannot control\" (T-2.IV.2:6,8). This means that neither black magic nor any negative experience can take our peace away, any more than a beautiful sunset can bring us peace. By the same token, when the mind chooses healing the choice may be reflected in the world through joining with a physician or other healer. The important thing to remember is that it is always the mind that chooses attack (the ego) or healing (the Holy Spirit). Our learning begins with our willingness to recognize how much we believe in our identity as bodies and prefer the ego's reversal of cause and effect, which supports our need to perceive ourselves as unfairly treated victims, rather than minds with the power to choose. The body was made to be vulnerable to attack. It gets sick, ages, decays and eventually dies. None of this matters nor has any effect on the mind's true identity. One of the important goals in studying and practicing the principles of the Course in our lives is to learn to identify with the mind, rather than with the body. This learning is a process that takes time, and the willingness to bring everything in our lives, positive as well as negative, to the Holy Spirit to be transformed through forgiveness."

    "text_input": "Q #704: We are a husband/wife team who began studying A Course in Miracles in 2004. If the Course is supposed to be based on universal principles and its goal is teaching we are all one, why is there so much Christian terminology--words like Easter, Christmas, crucifixion, Christ, Son of God--along with a Christian underpinning not recognizable to approximately two-thirds of the world? If the message is universal, why then is the language not universal? How will people around the world who have not been born into Christianity ever pick up the Course and \"get it\"? Is anyone working on a Course language that is universal in nature? How can we all unite as long as religious undertones continue to divide us? We wholeheartedly believe what is being taught by the methods of the Course, and we can see a bigger message within it: a message that impacts all races and peoples and religions. But how can that message be communicated through the language of the Judaeo-Christian biblical tradition?",
    "output": "Just about everyone who picks up the Course wonders about this. In fact, it is the topic of the very first question posted on this Service, and it is addressed most directly in the clarification of terms (the end of the manual for teachers) in the context of form and content: \"A universal theology is impossible, but a universal experience is not only possible but necessary. It is this experience towards which the course is directed\" (C-in.2:5-6). This universal experience is love, of course, and A Course in Miracles is but one form of regaining it. The form is not universal, nor was it meant to be: \"The form of the course varies greatly. So do the particular teaching aids involved. But the content of the course never changes ... It can be taught by actions or thoughts; in words or soundlessly, in any language or in no language; in any place or time or manner ... This is a manual for a special curriculum, intended for teachers of a special form of the universal course. There are many thousands of other forms, all with the same outcome\" (M-1.3:2-4,6; 4:1-2). Not very different from the ancient Hindu saying that truth is one, but sages know it by many names! The intended audience for this special curriculum is the Western world that has developed under the strong influence of Christianity and 20th-century psychology, \"an influence that has not been very Christian nor spiritual,\" as Kenneth and Gloria note in their book The Most Commonly Asked Questions About \"A Course in Miracles\" (#67). That accounts, in large measure, for the Christian and psychodynamic nature of the Course's language. To quote from another section in the clarification of terms: \"God knows what His Son needs before he asks. He is not at all concerned with form, but having given the content it is His Will that it be understood. And that suffices. The form adapts itself to need; the content is unchanging, as eternal as its Creator\" (C-3.3:2-5). Thus, an important focus of the Course is clarifying and correcting the misunderstandings and distortions found in biblical religions and psychology. Interestingly, the masculine language in the Course was never an issue with Helen Schucman, the scribe of the Course. The sexist objection arose only after its publication, and our experience has been that this objection generally tends to fade for most students as they become more involved in the spiritual process of the Course's content. (See Kenneth's Absence from Felicity, p. 416, for a summary of this issue.) Moreover, practically speaking, at this stage of human evolution (to stay within an ego framework) a universal language is impossible. Translations of the Course already exist in 11 languages, with many more in progress [ed. note: as of 2005]. Translators themselves have attested to the impossibility of a universal language--just in working with the Course alone they have come across concepts for which there is no equivalent in their own language, and this has nothing to do with religion. The ego's ongoing intent is to supplant oneness and unity, replacing them with separation and conflict, the crowning principles being one or the other and kill or be killed. The unbridgeable gulfs in language and culture are but means to this pernicious ego end. The choice of God's Son to follow the ego's thought system of separation instead of the Holy Spirit's thought system of forgiveness is what led to the divisive symbols of religions. Religions therefore just give form to the ego--they are not really the problem, for they but symbolize the ego dynamics in our minds that we continually reinforce and protect through defenses we no longer even recognize as such. The Course's emphasis therefore is on training us to get back to this level of decision in our minds, which we have blocked from our awareness. That is the only source of hope for ourselves and the world. What all of this ultimately comes down to is that when you are completely one with your Identity as God created you (which could be for just an instant), you then represent the universal content of the Course, namely that \"God's Son is guiltless, and in his innocence is his salvation\" (M- 1.3:5). This content then can be communicated through you to a person from a completely different tradition, in a form that could be recognized and accepted by that person (although the form may not even be recognized by you). So the emphasis is always on your acceptance of the Atonement through the practice of forgiveness, for when your mind is healed, the perfect oneness of love is reflected through you, and you would know that all minds share in that healing, so there would be no concern for \"spreading the word\"--that concern itself reinforces the belief that the separation is real and needs to be healed, a subtle ego trap. Love simply extends itself eternally, and the \"how\" is not our concern--that takes all the pressure off us. It is not necessary for us to understand how the entire Sonship benefits from our tiny willingness to change the teacher in our mind from the ego to Jesus, thereby seeing only shared interests instead of separate, competing interests. Indeed, we cannot understand this if we are not in the holy instant beyond the body and beyond time and space. \"The Power of Holiness\" (T-16.II) is one section in the text that discusses these ideas."

I wonder if I should be thinking about whether my sexual activity is in line with the Holy Spirit and what A Course in Miracles has to say about it.",
    "output": "Sex, like anything else we do with the body, such as eating or drinking or breathing, is neutral in itself, as far as the Course is concerned (W-pII.294). The Course would only ever ask us to be aware of the purpose we are giving it (e.g., T-17.VI.2:1-2), which means being tuned into our thoughts about what we are doing and why. Now it is likely that sexual relationships, no matter how circumscribed, are simply a form of special relationship, which, if both partners feel that their needs are being met, would be a special love relationship. So long as the special love relationships seem to be working, there will be no apparent problem and little motivation to examine the guilt that may be fueling any of the interactions. You may want to ask yourself whether you would be any less happy if your sexual outlets for some reason were not available to you. For the happiness that Jesus is inviting us to experience has nothing to do with meeting our personal needs. It is also likely that, at some level, the ego would be telling us that we are guilty for whatever pleasure we may be experiencing, because the hidden assumption is that whatever we have we have stolen from God. And so at an unconscious level there could be the belief that we deserve to be punished. But there is certainly no need to go looking for problems where, in your experience, none currently exists. Usually, our lives present us with enough obvious opportunities to practice forgiveness without the need to uncover others. We can rest assured that, if any area of our lives is in need of healing, which simply means that it is a symbol upon which we have projected our unconscious guilt, that need will become apparent when we are ready to look deeper."

However, sometimes I have this ambivalence about leaving my work. I have chosen the Course as my path and I want to learn to forgive a lot of things, including the situation I am describing here with my work.",
    "output": "Ironically, spending time studying the Course can be used as a way to avoid dealing with our current classroom. Now it is not surprising that a part of us, when we find the Course, will want to devote as much time as we can to learning this new way of thinking and seeing, since we know at some level, if it is our path, that it offers an answer that can be found nowhere in the world. But nevertheless there is a danger that we will want to retreat into the comfort of its words in order to avoid applying its principles to the very real lessons of forgiveness our external lives may be presenting us. The ego, after all, is very clever, and it will always attempt to co-opt the Voice of the Holy Spirit for its own purpose of self-preservation (T-4.V.1:6). So the key, as in all things, is awareness--recognizing our thoughts and feelings and how they are serving the ego thought system, not attempting to change anything about the external situation to meet our own perception of our needs, but only allowing the light of nonjudgmental perception to shine upon these darkened recesses of our mind. Now it would not be unusual that, after more than two decades with the same company, you would be ready for something else. But it would be your ego that would have an investment in sabotaging your final days with the company so that your performance may be less than satisfactory. And it also would not be unexpected that you would have mixed feelings over an impending life change of such magnitude, since change has become fearful to the mind that feels guilt over the first change that seemed to be introduced when the thought of separation was taken seriously (T-4.I.2:2-4). It is always helpful to remember that internal change is the only change that matters, and efforts to change the external situation are really only ego attempts to avoid first learning the lesson the situation is offering us, as an external projection of our internal guilt. But if we avoid the lesson being offered in the present moment, it will re-present itself to us again in the future, perhaps in a somewhat different form, but always with the same underlying content (T-31.VIII.3:1). So missed opportunities are never a cause for concern."

I am open to God as advocated by the Tao, A Course in Miracles, or Eckart Tolle. However, I fear that I will burn in hell, as punishment from God, if I do not accept the Christian God and go to church. I also fear that since the Course teaches that separation from God is the cause of all my unhappiness, I must accept God as the Course teaches, and become a Christian. I am also angered by Christians like Bush and Blair whose ideas cause the poverty, teen pregnancy, etc. that they attribute to Satan. I find this very confusing, am I going crazy?",
    "output": "You are probably not going crazy. It is the ego's use of religion, belief in sin, and a punishing God, who sends people to burn in hell, that are insane. A Course in Miracles is the right place to look for correction of the sin, guilt and fear taught in fundamentalist Christianity. The foundation of Christianity is the belief in sin, which is atoned for only through the crucifixion and death of Jesus. Salvation then means accepting Jesus and the Bible, as taught by organized religion. Biblical teaching is based on the belief that the world and the body are not only real, they were made by God. These teachings are what make Christianity and A Course in Miracles mutually exclusive. The Course teaches: \"God's Will for you is perfect happiness because there is no sin, and suffering is causeless\" (W- pI.101.6;1; italics ours). \"There is no hell\" (T-15.I.7:1). \"There is no world!\" (W-pI.132.6:2). \"The escape [from fear] is brought about by your acceptance of the Atonement, which enables you to realize that your errors never really occurred\" (T-2.I.4:4). \"Salvation is the recognition that the truth is true, and nothing else is true\" (W-p.I.152.3:1). Clearly these teachings put any fear of burning in hell to rest. They comprise the truth we are asked to recognize for salvation to be realized. Thus, salvation is not won by the suffering of the crucifixion, but by the simple acceptance of our innocence and our oneness with God, which has never been affected by the ego's thought of separation. Although the Course's message is simple, it is not easy for us to accept, because our attachment to the belief in sin and guilt is strong, as is our belief that we are bodies living in the world. We do not easily let go of these beliefs. In fact, we put up fierce resistance. Lured by the \"thrills\" of specialness, we have chosen to believe the ego's lie of separation. It is only this choice that keeps us from the awareness of our oneness with God. And it is this choice that we see reflected in our relationships. Thus it is the practice of forgiveness in our relationships that is the means the Course teaches for undoing the belief in separation. We are asked to see our judgments and attack thoughts as the expression of our desire to be separate, different, special, and most of all, better that others. Guilt for choosing separation in the first place is compounded by our attacks on others, and then projected back out in still more judgment/attack, in a seemingly endless cycle. This is the source of all pain and misery in our lives. Healing the mind of the thought of separation begins when we seek the Holy Spirit's help in letting go of these judgments. (This applies to judgments about the government leaders see #578.) Through forgiveness guilt and fear are diminished, to disappear eventually, thus allowing the light of our innocence to replace the shadow of guilt that darkens our minds. Only this is required. In this process, the moments of peace we experience, not the fear of punishment in hell, become the motivation to continue on our path of forgiveness. Jesus tells us: \"This course requires almost nothing of you. It is impossible to imagine one that asks so little, or could offer more\" (T-20.VII.1:7-8). In the light of the rules, regulations, and prohibitions of many religious paths, this is indeed encouraging."

    "text_input": "Q #708: Several days ago, I had an astonishing experience. I drove to a post office, dropped off a letter in the box outside and went inside where I bought stamps. When I left the building, I was suddenly struck by a realization that I had no memory whatsoever (and still don't) of my actions between exiting my car and entering the building. I did not remember locking my car, going to the box, dropping the letter in the box and heading for the door, all of which I must have done, because the letter was no longer in my hand and my car was locked when I returned.  I had a clear sense that NOTHING happened in a period of no more than 10 seconds, from the time I stepped out of my car till I opened the post office door. But something DID happen. What was it? I was not frightened by the experience. On the contrary, I felt a sense of tranquility. Did I  make contact with nothingness? Was I influenced by the all the reading I've done of late? Am I making much ado about nothing?",
    "output": "It's not possible to give a definitive answer to your \"amnesiac\" experience, just as it's rarely possible to be certain that any specific experience is right-minded. But if the experience were an expression of right-mindedness-- and since you describe your reaction as one of tranquility rather than fright, that certainly is possible--we can consider what may have been going on for you. Contrary to what seems to be our experience, the truth is that nothing is actually happening any of the time! It actually takes effort to see ourselves as bodies, doing things in the world. Our true natural state has nothing to do with bodies and the world. Yet for most of us, this realization is still too frightening. And so we continue to hold on to this bodily identification as a defense against the guilt in our minds and the love beneath that guilt, which is our true Identity. In the section \"I Need Do Nothing\" in the text (T-18.VII) of A Course in Miracles, Jesus comments on the unreality of the body, as well as our resistance to allowing ourselves to experience anything else: \"There is one thing that you have never done; you have not utterly forgotten the body. It has perhaps faded at times from your sight, but it has not yet completely disappeared. You are not asked to let this happen for more than an instant, yet it is in this instant that the miracle of Atonement happens. Afterwards you will see the body again, but never quite the same. And every instant that you spend without awareness of it gives you a different view of it when you return. At no single instant does the body exist at all. It is always remembered or anticipated, but never experienced just now. Only its past and future make it seem real. Time controls it entirely, for sin is never wholly in the present. In any single instant the attraction of guilt would be experienced as pain and nothing else, and would be avoided. It has no attraction now. Its whole attraction is imaginary, and therefore must be thought of in the past or in the future\" (T-18.VII.2-3). The experience you describe could recur, or it may not. But whether it does or not does not really matter. Any preoccupation with it could become a distraction from the Course's primary process of forgiving our special relationships, which is what undoes the guilt in the mind that we use identification with the body to defend against. If your experience has provided you with a glimpse of what lies ahead--or perhaps beyond is the more accurate way to put it--that can be helpful. The best thing is not to make a big deal of it but simply to accept it as a reminder that whenever we interpret anything that we perceive, we are certain to be wrong, for we have no idea what is real and what is illusion. And with that recognition can come the willingness to allow the Holy Spirit to be the Interpreter of whatever our eyes seem to behold."

    "text_input": "Q #709: In Absence From Felicity, Jesus talks of taking on a human form to Helen. But if you look at the tenor of his argument that may not be really so, and it may have well been Helen's fearful state of mind as Kenneth states. After all the body is an illusion and the resurrected mind recognizes an illusion as an illusion. I should think that Jesus' resurrection meant that his body identity disappeared and hence the physical body, as we also (apostles too) recognized it, disappeared from his mind. To have recognized Jesus after the crucifixion and death of his body, we need to be in an equally enlightened mind-frame to behold him lovingly in a state of vision. His body miraculously disappeared from the tomb due to this paradigm shift. But the resurrection meant that we discern him at another level. Please comment.",
    "output": "In Chapter 17 of Absence From Felicity, Kenneth discusses the illusion and the reality of both Helen and Jesus. All form is illusory and therefore ultimately meaningless, its value lying solely in our (the mind that believes it is separate from God's Mind) use of it to get to the content beyond the form, just as symbols are useful only in pointing us to what they symbolize--their source. Only the abstract, formless Love of God is real. Within the dream, however, this abstract, formless Love is reflected in the split mind in a form that can be recognized and accepted by that mind. Thus, in Helen's mind, this Love took the form of Jesus giving his course to her. In reality, there is no Jesus or Helen. Again, Chapter 17 discusses these levels, which are quite difficult for us to grasp. In A Course in Miracles, resurrection is not defined in relation to the crucifixion; it is entirely different in meaning from the traditional biblical view, in which a dead body is resurrected. Resurrection in the Course pertains only to awakening from the dream of separation from God: \"the awakening from the dream of death; the total change in mind that transcends the ego and its perceptions of the world, the body, and death, allowing us to identify completely with our true Self ...\" (Glossary-Index, p. 176/191; see also M-28.1:1-2). In view of the Course's definition of the body as simply a projection of a thought within the mind, this awakening can occur only in the mind. Thus: \"Given Jesus' perfectly egoless reactions at the end of his life [see T-6.I], it would be safe to conclude that his resurrection preceded the crucifixion. It is that healing of the mind, therefore, that he asks us to take as our model for learning (T-6.in.2:1; T-6.I.3:6; 7:2), and forgiveness is his great teaching message that brings about the mind-reversal that alone can heal\" (from our Christian Psychology in \"A Course in Miracles,\" pp. 74, 75). This is why Jesus implores us, \"Teach not that I died in vain. Teach rather that I did not die by demonstrating that I live in you\" (T-11.VI.7:3-4). The meaning and significance of Jesus' life as presented in the Course is radically different from that of the Bible, and its metaphysics is radically different as well (there is no world created by God, for example). It is essential that these irreconcilable differences be recognized if one is to understand and then be able to put into practice the teaching in A Course in Miracles. You may be interested in consulting the dialogue between Kenneth and a Catholic priest, which brings these differences clearly into the light (\"A Course in Miracles\" and Christianity: A Dialogue). There also are several other Questions that discuss these important issues; see for example: #1, #97, #439, and #505."

Also, that all our doubts and fears all boil down to being those about God, ultimately.",
    "output": "Yes, it is true. The unique contribution of A Course in Miracles, however, is that it does not advocate avoiding or renouncing the substitutes for God--much less calling them sinful--even when we become aware that that is what we are involved in. Thus, there are two levels of discourse in the Course. On Level One we find statements of absolute truth, such as your first statement. On Level Two we find statements and discussion about living in this world (though illusory) in such as way that we would gradually accept its illusory nature, as well as the illusory nature of our identities as separate individuals. \"The body was not made by love. Yet love does not condemn it and can use it lovingly, respecting what the Son of God has made and using it to save him from illusions\" (T-18.VI.4:7-8). Thus, on this second level, the Course addresses the decision-making mind outside time and space that chooses between the wrong-minded and right-minded use of the world and our bodily identities. When we accept the Holy Spirit's purpose (forgiveness) for our lives, we gently grow into the ideal of always being peaceful no matter what is going on in our personal worlds or the world at large. That is the meaning of liberty in the Course--being freed of the ego's tyrannical domination of our thinking, which is the source of all suffering and fear. All of our fears and doubts about our lives in the world are shadows of what is really going on in our minds, as the world is but \"the outside picture of an inward condition\" (T-25.VIII.12:3; T-21.in.1:5). The process of attaining liberty, therefore, is the transition from wrong-mindedness to right- mindedness, and finally to the restoration of the One-mindedness that is our natural state. The section in the text called \"Beyond All Idols\" (T-30.III) is a lovely reflection on this theme."

Could you address the issue of gossiping and would stopping gossiping be my way of forgiving myself, or what do I have to do to make up for this. I am very serious about seeing this differently.",
    "output": "A Course in Miracles teaches that the only thing that can have any seeming effect on anyone is a choice made in the mind to identify with the ego/body. That is the only \"harmful\" thing that anyone can do to themselves. In the light of this teaching, it is impossible for anyone to do harm to someone else. Although it may seem that someone's hurtful behavior is the cause of another person's upset, the Course tells us the true source of any feeling is a choice in the mind. Finding yourself feeling sick after gossiping about others is the result of a choice in the mind to identify with the ego, which is a choice for separation. It is this that elicits profound feelings of guilt, which are then experienced in the world in a situation such as the one you describe. There seems to be an association related to the behavior of gossiping, but in fact the sickness is an expression in form of the guilt in the mind. It is the content of the mind that is the focus of the Course. What we are asked to see differently is this distinction between the seeming cause of feelings in a situation in form, and the real cause which is the content of the mind. This is a very important distinction to keep in mind as we train our minds to become aware of the judgments and attack thoughts that we experience in our relationships. This applies equally to your experience as a child, as to the recent incident of gossiping with your friend. The Course does not teach anything about changing behavior or the need to make amends. We are asked only to look at our judgments, recognizing in them the choice to be separate from others, which reflects the choice to be separate from God. When you find yourself gossiping, you may stop to remember it is coming from a mistaken choice in your mind to identify with the ego by choosing separation. This places the origin of the situation in the right place (your mind), rather than on your behavior (the effect) or the behavior of those you are judging, and this is the beginning of the forgiveness process. We \"forgive the Son of God [anyone] for what he did not do\" (T-17.III.1:5) by recognizing that the true cause of sickness/gossiping is the mind's choice for separation, without blaming past events or others. This would be the Course's version of \"making up.\" It is also the only way to heal the real sickness that resides in the split mind that has chosen separation. All that is required is willingness to release our judgments. Even being willing to see how we want to hold on to them is a step in the right direction, because at least we won't be blaming others for our sickness, distress, or misery. The important thing is to be vigilant in looking for the thoughts and judgments that reveal the mind's choice for separation. When the cause is returned to the mind, judgment can be given to the Holy Spirit to be transformed. Under His guidance, any behavior will then change accordingly, without any effort or control on our part. In this regard Jesus tells us in the text: \"When you are willing to accept sole responsibility for the ego's existence you will have laid aside all anger and all attack, because they come from an attempt to project responsibility for your own errors. But having accepted the errors as yours, do not keep them. Give them over quickly to the Holy Spirit to be undone completely, so that all their effects will vanish from your mind and from the Sonship as a whole\" (T-7.VIII.5:4-6). Thus, projection is replaced with the recognition that the mind is the true cause of all feelings, behavior, and judgment and ultimately the need to gossip \"will vanish from your mind.\""

    "output": "To answer your question we must first understand that the love we speak of in the world is what A Course in Miracles calls \"special love.\" This \"love\" is the ego's \"shabby substitute\" (T- 16.IV.8:4) for God's Love, which was denied when the mind chose separation. In contrast to the Father's Love, it is limited to certain people, changes, and is replete with expectations based on mutual bargains designed to meet individual needs. Special love is the key ingredient of \"...the special relationship [which] is the renunciation of the Love of God, and the attempt to secure for the self the specialness that He denied\" (T-16.V.4:2). Clarity about the nature of special love is important because it is so familiar to us, and so easily confused with the love that Jesus speaks of in the Course. This ego version of love is as different from God's Love as truth is from illusion. In the choice to be separate and special we have forgotten Love. This is the sad and painful condition of the separated. However, our hope, along with the more direct answer to your question, can be found in Jesus' comforting words in the text: \"Love is not special. If you single out part of the Sonship for your love, you are imposing guilt on all your relationships and making them unreal. You can love only as God loves. Seek not to love unlike Him, for there is no love apart from His. Until you recognize that this is true, you will have no idea what love is like\" (T-13.X.11:2-6). This passage may not seem comforting at first, but it tells us several significant things: special love is not love, we do not know what love is, and it is possible to love \"as God loves.\" Here we also find the instructions we need to move from special love to God's Love: we must accept that we do not know what love is, and we must recognize that there is no Love but God's. These truths seem simple enough. However, we are firmly convinced that we do know what love is, and we are deeply attached to the ego's substitute for love. These are very effective defenses of our decision to identify with the body. And, to the extent that we identify with our bodies, we withdraw from Love, thereby denying it to ourselves and to others. Bodies do not love; in fact, they do nothing: \"It [the body] does nothing ... It is nothing\" (T-19.IV-C.5:3,5). If we desire Love then, our concern must be focused on the process of undoing our belief in our ego/body identity. This is accomplished through forgiveness, which we may say is how we love in the dream. The Course does not ask that we give love, for to do so implies that someone who has it gives it to someone who does not. Rather, the Course teaches that the process of forgiveness leads to the removal of \"the blocks to the awareness of love's presence\" (T-in.1:7), and then: \"Love extends outward simply because it cannot be contained\" (T-7.I.3:4). In other words, when the obstacles of guilt and fear are removed, the reflection of God's Love that remains in our minds is free to extend without any effort on our part. The only active participation that is required is that we diligently apply ourselves to the practice of forgiveness in our relationships. That is what transforms the special love of a special relationship to a holy relationship, and brings us closer to Love's presence in our minds. In this process, the purpose the mind gives to a relationship changes from the ego's goal of making the separation/bodies real to the Holy Spirit's goal of healing the mind of the thought of separation. A Course in Miracles' version of a well-known biblical passage would read \"greater love than this no one has, than to forgive his brother for what he did not do\" (see T-17.III.1). This reflects one of the most important teachings of the Course; i.e., no one outside of us is responsible for the choice we made to be separate, or for the misery we experience as a result. Learning this restores the power of our minds to our awareness, so we will be free to make the choice for real love: \"Beyond the poor attraction of the special love relationship, and always obscured by it, is the powerful attraction of the Father for His Son. There is no other love that can satisfy you, because there is no other love. This is the only love that is fully given and fully returned\" (T-15.VII.1:1- 3)."

    "text_input": "Q #713: I checked the other two Q's & A's on the decision maker and hope I can still get some more feedback. It would seem that it would have to have some connection to the Holy Spirit in order to choose forgiveness for example, which is choosing \"against\" the ego. Would it be equivalent to awareness of both ego and the Holy Spirit? Is it neutral and if so is there any truly neutral thing? When attention is on this awareness and the impulse is to see my brother's innocence why would this not be the Holy Spirit mediating in the dream with its answer of forgiveness? For example \"who\" is reading A Course in Miracles for help in remembering freedom is my natural condition? Is this the I of Self inquiry that Ramana Maharshi teaches one to ask \"who am I\" and continue to allow one's attention to go deeper and deeper into that awareness knowing the answer is ultimately enlightenment? Is cracking this mystery the big One that gives us our ultimate release? Please help!",
    "output": "First, the term decision maker does not appear in the Course except for one occurrence in the manual, where it is used in a different context (M-5.II.1:7). But it is clear throughout the Course that Jesus is talking about a capacity of the mind that is outside time and space to choose between the ego and the Holy Spirit--depicted in various ways: e.g., crucifixion and resurrection, murder and love, guilt and innocence, separation and Atonement. It can identify with either thought system, but it is never not identifying with one or the other. In that sense it is never neutral. It can be thought of thus as a third part of the mind, which is the point of Jesus' asking us to consider: \"Who is the 'you' who are living in this world?\" (T-4.II.11:8). The \"you\" that is \"reading A Course in Miracles for help in remembering freedom is my natural condition\" is the decision maker that has chosen to identify with the content of its right mind in the form of being a student of the Course. The Holy Spirit can be thought of in this context as the memory in our minds of our true Self. The impulse to forgive, then, is a reflection of our choice to remember our true Identity by denying our denial of It. The Holy Spirit is a Mediator, but only in the symbolic sense of representing in our minds the Love we chose to reject but that remains unaffected by our choice and always inviting us to rejoin our oneness with It. There are two important points to keep in mind in any discussion of this nature: First, we are talking about symbols--essentially a mythological characterization of a process that occurred (not in truth of course) before there ever was a human intellect or brain (the effects of our wish to be who we are not), and therefore our attempts to fit the concept into human intellectual categories, while helpful to some extent, can never be successful. Moreover, because the separation is unreal, we are describing something inherently illusory. Second, the core of the ego's strategy is to suppress this awareness of ourselves as minds outside time and space and keep us convinced that we are limited physical entities instead. This is important because it means that our efforts to gain a precise understanding of this decision-making capacity will fall short to the extent to which we are still identified with the ego--we would be fighting against ourselves. The focus of our work with the Course, therefore, should be on undoing this identification. That is the Course's path, in contrast to other paths. Understanding takes us part way on our journey, but it is not the goal of our work--there is no \"mystery to be cracked\" in this sense. In view of what has been said thus far, it would seem that there are differences between the Self described by Ramana Maharshi and the Course's notion of the decision maker, though there are some similarities insofar as the decision maker is also an \"observer.\" We all will wind up in the same place, we can rest assured, but the spiritual road maps are different, which does not make one superior to the other. The lessons in the first part of the workbook begin the process of restoring our awareness of ourselves as decision-making minds, but recovering that awareness is not enlightenment from the Course's point of view. We need to reach that level of self-awareness so that we can recognize that we are always choosing, what we are choosing, and why we are choosing it. Stated briefly, the goal of this process is that we would see clearly that we are ultimately choosing insanity, why we are choosing it, and that there is an Alternative for us to choose. As our trust in Jesus develops, we would have little difficulty choosing against insanity: \"Who with the Love of God upholding him could find the choice of miracles or murder hard to make?\" (T-23.IV.9:8). When that choice is made once and for all--i.e., there is no returning to the ego--the decision-making capacity is no longer needed, and our mind is restored to its natural state of One-mindedness. This is the Self that is beyond individuality and perception-- not understandable to us who are still identified with specifics."

    "text_input": "Q #714: I have asked this before in a different form but my forgiveness path seems to be a little different from others.' Most of the time we have a problem of guilt and then we realize that the wrath we directed at ourselves was wrong-minded. But I also find that I tend to over-idealize others' abilities and good intentions and then when I forgive I see their true motives at times. Can you comment on this?",
    "output": "This is the flip side of being overly critical and only seeing flaws in others. There is a middle ground of acknowledging that we all have a wrong mind, a right mind, and the capacity to choose between them, and that until our minds are healed, we will be motivated by the ego most of the time. This means that we are all looking out for our own interests so that we can protect our specialness and get what we want. The process of forgiveness involves first recognizing hatred, greed, selfishness, etc., not denying it or trying to pretty it up. Then, by not judging these ego manifestations, you will be less and less personally affected by them and finally able to see beyond them to the love they hide. Idealizing people's abilities and good intentions is a form of special love: you see these people as different and fulfilling a specific need of yours. But special love always covers hatred, which is why you would then tend to see their ego traits when you have a right-minded moment. In that state of mind you no longer are compelled to see others as you (your ego) need them to be. You therefore would be more objective in seeing what is there--both the wrong and right minds. And there would be no fear of looking at the darkness in your own mind or in others."

    "text_input": "Q #715: I can't quite comprehend how Jesus talks to us on a seemingly individual level but we're all considered one and illusory. If I'm stepping back and watching my ego do its thing and everybody else is doing the same thing, how does it all tie together at the decision maker. How does this all tie together into oneness? I realize that we are all illusory, that everything germinates from the decision maker and everything from that point is not real. But I just can't seem to put it together. I understand that Jesus is really talking to the decision maker when it sounds like he's talking to us on an individual level. What if I'm going through the right process but somebody else isn't? What's happening here?",
    "output": "There is a point over which you seem to be confusing yourself--believing that there is only a single decision maker making decisions for all the seemingly separate individuals with which we each identify. At one level, this is true, but at a practical level it is not particularly helpful, and leads to the kind of muddle you describe finding yourself in. It is more helpful, and more in line with our personal experience, to think of each of us as having our own individual decision maker, which really means we each can choose between the ego and the Holy Spirit, independent of what anyone else may be choosing. In the beginning, when the Son first seemed to fall asleep and dream a dream of separation, there was only one illusory sleeping mind, which had a choice between going deeper into the dream and awakening. When the Son chose to go deeper into the dream, as part of his defense against awakening, the one mind seemed to fragment into billions and billions of separate, individual minds. But each fragment is holographic, that is, it contains exactly what the single, illusory mind contained before the fragmentation--the right mind (the Holy Spirit), the wrong mind (the ego) and the power to choose between them (the decision maker). In A Course in Miracles, when we speak of Jesus as talking to the decision maker, we mean that he is addressing our individual decision maker, in the mind, and not the individual physical self we each believe we are here in the world. In other words, the distinction being made about who/what Jesus is addressing is not between individuality and oneness, but between the body and the mind. Forgiveness, although a reflection of the oneness of Heaven, is experienced in the mind at an individual level, while we still believe we are separate from each other. It is only when I have completely accepted the Atonement for myself and, as an individual decision maker, made my final choice against the ego and for the Holy Spirit, that I identify completely with the oneness that the Holy Spirit represents in the right mind and no longer identify with the individuality that the ego represents in the wrong mind. And with that final choice, the wrong mind disappears, there is no longer anything to choose between, and so the decision maker vanishes as well. We've addressed variations of your question in Questions #165and #277, which you may find helpful to review, for a more in-depth discussion of how to move between notions of unity and multiplicity."

    "text_input": "Q #716: I am going to have surgery on my shoulder in a month. I have been dealing with this situation for about a year, and am now finally facing the facts. I kept hoping for a different  outcome and put off even finding out about the true nature of the problem. I kept trying to hold Jesus' hand, but I actually kept buying into the ego's plans. Because I am in pain I don't know how to get out of it. I remember hearing on a tape or reading here that you should just use the magic it takes to heal your condition so you can get on with studying A Course in Miracles. I read in the teacher's manual: \"Who would choose suffering unless he thought it brought him something, and something of value to him ... For sickness is an election; a decision. It is the choice of weakness in the mistaken conviction that it is strength\" (M-5.I.1:2,4-5). After pondering this really seriously I have come to believe that I have used this as an excuse to \"not do\" lots of things I had been doing for years, such as weekly aerobics classes--I started walking every day instead. I guess it is a martyr's complex. I have told people about my condition at various times for a year now, until now they just ask, \"How are your shoulders?\" So I see what I have done, but that hasn't taken the pain away. Can you please comment?",
    "output": "It looks like you've identified some of the secondary gains that you're reaping from your condition. That's always very helpful to see, for it unmasks the ego's true intentions a little more clearly so we can begin to see what it is up to. And there is a gain--\"something of value\"--at a deeper level, to which the section you quote from is also alluding (M-5.I, II). As you can begin to get in touch with that hidden value, you will understand why there is such resistance to letting go of the pain. But the fact that you're willing to seek help outside yourself on the level of the body through the surgery can be seen as a reflection of your willingness to acknowledge that you can not resolve this on your own, as the ego would like you to believe you can. And that belief--that we can be and act on our own--is actually the cause of the pain. Sometimes, as you've discovered, we think we are asking for help from Jesus with our pain, when we are actually using our asking as a cover for our own fear of looking at what we believe is buried in our minds--the horrible guilt and pain over separation. The primary but unconscious \"value\" of sickness and disability is that they place responsibility for our pain outside the mind, in the body, as a victim of forces in the world beyond its control. And this apparent relationship denies that our pain has anything to do with a choice we have made in our minds to see ourselves as separate from God and His Love. In other words, bodily sickness protects our concept of ourselves as individuals, trying to cope with a world that exists independent of us. And the resistance to recognizing that all our pain comes from our own decision, that we have made this all up, is \"enormous\" (M-5.II.1:7), for it threatens the existence of both the world and the self we think we are. Accepting responsibility at the level of mind for all of our experience (T-21.II.2) is not something that most of us can simply do all at once, once we have an intellectual understanding of what we are doing. Because the resistance is so great, it is likely for most of us to be a process--of practicing forgiveness, releasing the judgments we are holding against ourselves and others--that will seem to take time. In the meantime, congratulate yourself for taking the next step and acknowledging your pain and recognizing that you can not resolve the condition by yourself. Allowing yourself to join with the medical professionals who are there to help you address the pain in your shoulder can be a symbol of your willingness to join with the all-encompassing love in the mind that removes all pain and guilt and experience of separation."

    "text_input": "Q #717: What does one do when a loved one is behaving very self destructively, and possibly endangering other loved ones? I want to \"let go and let God,\" but feel a desperate need to do  something to stop this situation. There are legal proceedings I can and am considering taking. When I read A Course in Miracles, it seems to say one should just apply the principle of loving the other and not react negatively. Should I do what is necessary but focus on the love rather than the anger, anxiety, despair, etc., that I can so easily slip into? This is so hard to deal with.",
    "output": "Your dilemma is understandable. It is very painful to see a loved one in conflict and endangering others. The Course does not ask us not to do whatever we can to stop someone from hurting himself / herself, or hurting others. It is certainly possible to practice forgiveness as the Course teaches while initiating legal proceedings, if that is what you think you should do. Since the foundation of the world is the belief in the ego's thought system of attack and counter-attack, everything and everyone in it engage in destructive behavior to some degree. That is the inevitable expression of the separated son's desperate call for help. What we are asked to do is look at any judgments we may have toward the person, seeing in them the projection of our own desperate call for help. Once we recognize how our fears are mirrored in the other person, we have the opportunity to forgive ourselves, asking the Holy Spirit to replace our judgments against ourselves and our brother with His. This process establishes that whatever we do or don't do with regard to another's behavior will be guided by the Holy Spirit rather than by the ego. Filing legal suits is an appropriate course of action in certain circumstances, it does not mean, however, that the other party is a guilty sinner, worthy of God's punishment, as the ego would have us believe. The choice, therefore, is not what course of action to pursue, but whose counsel we seek: the ego's or the Holy Spirit's. In this light we may paraphrase the oft-quoted line from the text: \"seek not to change your brother, but choose to change your mind about your brother\" (T-21.in.1:7). The anger, anxiety, and despair that you feel are normal. Jesus tells us kindly in \"Rules for Decision\": \"Do not fight yourself\" (T-30.I.1:7), which means not denying your feelings, nor judging yourself for having them. Though their cause seems to be the conflicted relationship, they are in truth the result of the mind's choice to believe that separation from God has been accomplished and love has been destroyed. Acknowledging them, with willingness to recognize their true source in the mind, is the beginning of the forgiveness process, and thus \"A light has entered the darkness\" (M-1.1:4). It may be a tiny spark, but it is enough to redirect the mind toward the Holy Spirit and away from the ego. This same spark is present in everyone's mind. At the same time that we recognize the power of our own minds to choose, we strengthen our belief in it in others. The healing power of forgiveness is thus communicated to all the loved ones concerned, whether or not it is recognized. It is \" ... the light that brings your peace of mind to other minds\" (W-pI.108.3:2). This the kindest thing you can do for yourself and for your loved one, whatever else you feel you must do in form to appease the situation."

    "text_input": "Q #718: The answer to #459 stated: \"Our so-called lives as individuals do not have a divine origin or destiny, and, worst of all, have no reality.\" How then can the Course have anything to say to me as its reader, when I am but an illusion, since there is no communication between an illusion and the truth? Why would the Course try to call back to Heaven an illusion? Is it a lie that the Course often calls us, in my opinion you and me, Sons of God (27 times)?",
    "output": "A commonly expressed concern, and among the most challenging dimensions of the theory of A Course in Miracles. What helps is discerning that the Course is written on two levels. The first presents statements of absolute truth that affirm its uncompromising non-dualism. The second is the level that addresses us as though we were real --contrasting the wrong-minded and right- minded ways of living in this illusory world with an illusory identity, so that we could begin the process of restoring to our awareness the truth of the Atonement; namely, that the separation from God never truly happened, and we remain as God created us, His one Son. Thus, while in reality there is only one Son, we experience ourselves as individuals, and therefore Jesus sometimes uses the term Son and sometimes the terms Sons. We get a good sense of this in the summary in Part II of the workbook called \"What Is Creation?\": \"We are creation; we the Sons of God. We seem to be discrete, and unaware of our eternal unity with Him. Yet back of all our doubts, past all our fears, there still is certainty. For love remains with all its Thoughts, its sureness being theirs. God's memory is in our holy minds, which know their oneness and their unity with their Creator. Let our function be only to let this memory return, only to let God's Will be done on earth, only to be restored to sanity, and to be but as God created us\" (W-pII.11.4). We are thus taught that we took with us into the dream of separation the memory of our true Identity as one with our Source, and our return to this memory is the objective of all Jesus' teaching in his course, as for example, in this passage from the text: \"Father and Son and Holy Spirit are as One, as all your brothers join as one in truth. Christ and His Father never have been separate, and Christ abides within your understanding, in the part of you that shares His Father's Will. The Holy Spirit links the other part--the tiny, mad desire to be separate, different and special --to the Christ, to make the oneness clear to what is really one. In this world this is not understood, but can be taught\" (T-25.I.5:3-6). Thus, Jesus uses our \"tiny, mad\" belief that we are real as individuals to teach us that we are not (W-pI.93.5). He asks us to acknowledge: \"I do not know the thing I am, and therefore do not know what I am doing, where I am, or how to look upon the world or on myself\"; but as fearful as these admissions may be, \"Yet in this learning is salvation born. And What you are will tell you of Itself\" (T-31.V.17.7-9). There is no judgment or condemnation in this --only the relief of letting go of a false identity so that the memory of our true Self can dawn upon our healed minds. \"Let me not forget myself is nothing, but my Self is all\" (W-pI.358.1:7). Questions #3, #72, #85, and #116 have additional pertinent commentary, and our Web site also provides a full explanation and diagrams of the two levels of the Course's discourse. This topic is addressed as well in Question #9 in our book The Most Commonly Asked Questions About A Course in Miracles."

    "text_input": "Q #719: In Lesson 136 of A Course in Miracles, what does the phrase \"make plans against uncertainties to come\" (19:2) mean? It sounds as if you shouldn't even plan a trip in case you can't get the time off.",
    "output": "The message this lesson teaches rests on two of the Course's principles regarding the body. The first is that the body itself is nothing: \"The body no more dies than it can feel. It does nothing. Of itself it is neither corruptible nor incorruptible. It is nothing\" (T-19.IV-C.i.5:2-5). And secondly: \"... apart from the mind the body has no purpose at all\" (T-8.VII.13:6). It is the mind that chooses whether the body is used for the ego's purpose or the Holy Spirit's. A choice to identify with the ego places the body under its laws of sickness and death. The body then becomes vulnerable to attack, serving as a projection of the guilt in the mind that results from choosing the ego. It is this identification with the ego that is the drive behind all our bodily concerns. It is why we exhaust ourselves caring for the body, ensuring its safety and protection in countless ways by planning. The goal of this lesson, as with the entire Course, is to teach us that we are not bodies, but minds with the power to choose. When the mind chooses to identify with the body, it then directs the body to become sick, and eventually to die, as proof that the body does in fact exist and that the mind is subject to its laws, instead of the other way around. This insane reversal of cause and effect is the ego's strategy to prove that truth can be obliterated, and that \"...the body is more powerful than everlasting life, Heaven more frail than hell, and God's design for the salvation of His Son opposed by a decision stronger than His Will\" (W-pI.136.9:2). Because this belief denies everything that is true, it results in our feeling weak and vulnerable in spite of any display of imagined strength. Fearful that we will be annihilated by forces beyond our control (ultimately God), we unceasingly plan and strategize to protect ourselves. This is what the lesson refers to. It does not mean that we should not make plans in our lives, but that we recognize the ego's belief system at work in the thoughts that motivate our restless seeking, and our desperate need for protection. In the previous lesson, Jesus tells us \"A healed mind does not plan. It carries out the plans that it receives through listening to wisdom that is not its own\" (W-pI.135.11:1-2; italics ours). Because the healed mind no longer identifies with the body, it no longer perceives itself as vulnerable and therefore needs no defense nor protection. Fully identified with the part of the mind that remembers the truth of who we are, it is free to be guided, rather than driven to plan. That is the goal we seek. Meanwhile, we continue to make all the plans we feel we must, looking clearly and without judgment at how much we believe in our identities as bodies and our need to plan. We might do as Jesus suggests earlier in the lesson: \" ... pause to ask, as you elaborate your plans and make your armor thicker and your locks more tight, what you defend, and how, and against what\" (W-pI.135.3:5). That is all that is required to invite the Holy Spirit to lead us to healing; not to heal us of the little plans we make, but to heal our minds of our mistaken belief about ourselves."

    "text_input": "Q #720: Over the past several weeks, I have begun to notice how often I am clamoring for attention, trying to make myself superior, trying to put someone else down, trying to be noticed, and on and on. All, it seems, being driven by the need to feel \"special.\" The fact that I notice this so clearly makes me very happy, and the fact that I do not berate myself when I notice I am doing it makes me feel even happier. My question is: what do I do once I notice it? I feel like I need to do something to \"change\" it, but I'm guessing this is actually what I shouldn't do. If so, what do I do with this awareness?",
    "output": "Stay with it. You are right, it is not necessary to change anything. In fact, we cannot change the illusions the ego puts forth, and trying to do so gives them a power they do not have in truth. The only requirement is willingness to recognize the ego's antics for what they are (effects of the mind's choice for separation), see the purpose they serve in keeping us attached to our identity with the body, and ask the Holy Spirit's help to make another choice. This is simple enough. The problem of our fierce attachment to specialness means we do not always want the Holy Spirit's help, because we want our specialness more. However, if you keep noticing/looking you will see how this specialness is the cause of feelings ranging from mild uneasiness to intense guilt, in spite of the fact that you are not judging yourself for the specialness. As the pain of these feelings becomes unbearable it awakens in us a deeper desire for healing, which shifts us away from the darkness of our attraction to specialness toward the light of who we truly are as God's innocent Son. It is important to remember that your increased awareness does not mean that you cherish your specialness more, now that you notice it. It means that you now know what the ego is up to, and that is very significant. When the mind chooses to identify with the body, it denies its true identity as spirit, thus obliterating it from awareness. That is why we are not aware of the choosing activity of the mind, but can become aware, as you describe, of the effects of the choice the mind makes. This awareness, brought about and fostered by looking at the specific form the choice for separation takes in our relationships, is the only way for us to learn to identify with the mind rather than with the body. Only by learning we are minds can we use the power of the mind to not choose separation. The awareness you speak of is a very important step out of the denial that is the ego's cornerstone. If \"not seeing\" keeps us rooted in the problem of separation, \"seeing\" is clearly the beginning of the solution. The ego thrives on denial; the Holy Spirit offers us awareness. To ultimately become aware of the memory of God's Love present in our minds, we must first become aware of all the defenses we have raised against that Love. So, the only thing to do now is keep looking without judgment, but with the vigilance that is required: \"...vigilance is essential ... [it] is not necessary for truth, but it is necessary against illusions\" (T6.V-C.8:6,9). The important \"sequence of events\" to remember as you continue to look vigilantly is: 1. What you see (specialness, judgment, projection) is the effect of the mind's choice for separation. 2. This choice is the true cause of all the pain and anguish in our lives and our world. 3. The mind has the power to choose differently. Awareness is thus the \"pearl of great price\" in the curriculum A Course in Miracles has set for us leading us to finally make the choice for God."

It is like I want to tell everyone about it, and think that they are worthy of it but I am not. I know that Jesus says that \"excluding yourself from the Atonement is the ego's last ditch effort ... \" but why do I do this? Can you comment on this?",
    "output": "Only resistance keeps us from personally accepting Jesus' loving message and from applying the Course's teachings of forgiveness in our relationships. This resistance is experienced in some form by everyone who studies the Course. The reason for the resistance is fear. We are afraid that if we accept Jesus' love, which is the reflection of God's Love, we will lose the special individual selves we cherish. They were chosen to replace the Identity God gave us as His innocent Son, which was denied when the separation thought was taken seriously. Believing this was a terrible \"sin\" makes us feel unworthy of God's Love, and it is this Love that is reflected in the Course, which is why you feel it is for everyone else, but you are unworthy of it. The fact is, we are unworthy of the false identity as bodies that we tenaciously cling to. Having seemingly lost our true treasure (our Identity as God's innocent Son), the ego tells us we will be left with nothing if we lose the specialness of our identity as bodies. We believe this and then refuse to listen to the Holy Spirit's interpretation of who we are, or to practice His lessons of forgiveness. However, \"The ego does not know what it is trying to teach. It is trying to teach you what you are without knowing what you are. It is expert only in confusion. It does not understand anything else. As a teacher, then, the ego is totally confused and totally confusing\" (T-8.II.1:4-8). Its confusing message tells us the body/brain has the power to choose and make decisions about everything, including who we are. Once we choose to believe this, it is not easy to reverse our upside-down thinking regarding the body and the mind, because learning we are minds means everything we believe about ourselves and the world is false: \"The resistance to recognizing this [that the mind makes decisions] is enormous, because the existence of the world as you perceive it depends on the body being the decision maker\" (M-5.II.1:7). Our hope lies in the power of our minds to make another choice. We can choose to believe the Holy Spirit's teaching by allowing Him to gradually replace our mistaken beliefs about ourselves with His perception. We need not do battle with our resistance to His teaching once we become aware of it. That only makes it real, and gives it more power to keep us defended against hearing His Voice. It is enough to begin by recognizing the sneaky forms resistance takes to confuse us, and then not take it seriously. We are led gently, just as we would gently lead a child to peek into the closet where the \"monster\" hides. \"The Holy Spirit does not seek to throw you into panic. So He merely asks if just a little question might be raised\" (T-31.V.11:5-6). Whenever we are overcome with feelings of unworthiness or guilt, we may ask, \"And what if I were wrong?\" Raising just this little doubt about our \"rightness\" allows a ray of the Holy Spirit's healing light to enter the darkness of our confusion and lessens our belief in the ego's madness."

    "text_input": "Q #722: I am certain that I have read and heard Ken say that our lives here (in the dream) are the constant acting out of what we believe happened to cause the separation from God--that we wanted to be special and because God cannot give special favor, we killed Him and usurped His place. In that moment the mind split. The facilitator in the group I attend often defines the separation as something that happened to us when we were very young--usually by a parent whom we loved and trusted, and that parent did or said something that was not love, and so we gave it an interpretation other than love, and that was our introduction to the \"ego.\" Can you comment on these interpretations--they seem to be saying the same thing. I see my relationship with my parents as being the acting out of my relationship with God. I chose autonomy from God and continue to do so and I chose autonomy from my parents as all children do in this dream.",
    "output": "The separation, as it is spoken of in A Course in Miracles, has nothing to do with the body. The body is simply the projection of a thought of guilt in the mind--it embodies that thought, if you will. The separation began, as you say, when the Son of God believed he had killed God and gave himself existence as a separate mind (not in reality, of course). The process of fragmenting what once was one continued, culminating in our experience right now of there being multitudes of separate, individualized beings. All that we are doing, however, despite appearances, is reliving \"the single instant when the time of terror took the place of love\" (T-26.V.13:1). So, yes, our interactions with our parents--and everyone else as well--would reflect the ego thoughts in our minds or, in a holy instant, the love in our minds. What is so hard for us to fathom is that the mind (not the brain) of the infant or child is a mature mind containing both the thought system of the ego and the thought system of the Holy Spirit along with the capacity to choose between the two. The separation is already a \"reality\" for that mind. It projects itself into the form of a body, which appears to begin as an infant and then develops through various stages into adulthood. But since ideas leave not their source, this is all going on only within the mind, which is outside time and space."

    "text_input": "Q #723: Is it right that from the viewpoint of A Course in Miracles we are already \"saved\" and have always been, and isn't that the humorous part in all of the book that we ask so many questions and struggle and struggle and it's all already done for us? If someone from outside were watching us, wouldn't that be good stuff for a comedy? Aren't love and humor closely linked? How can we express that love in this world without being absorbed by it? By letting ourselves be absorbed?",
    "output": "As Jesus tells us in the text: \"It is a joke to think that time can come to circumvent eternity ... \" (T-27.VIII.6:5). This means that when viewed from the Holy Spirit's perspective we find ourselves in a humorous situation as you indicate. In the end, just before God reaches down to lift us to Himself, we will smile at the foolishness of the entire dream. Meanwhile, that smile can be experienced in the dream in the holy instant and the real world (T-19.III.10; 27.VII.14; W-pI.153.14; T-15.V.11). For one who knows that separation from God is impossible, the belief in separation is preposterous and perhaps comical. For one who believes separation is real, its effects seem real as well, and are experienced as disastrous and painful (T-27.VIII.8:4- 7). You are correct in saying that we are saved and have, in truth, never left our home in God. We certainly would not need to struggle and question if we accepted this truth as true. The problem is that we think we are here and do not believe the truth about ourselves. As Jesus tells us in the text: \"This is a very simple course. Perhaps you do not feel you need a course which, in the end, teaches that only reality is true. But do you believe it? When you perceive the real world, you will recognize that you did not believe it\" (T-11.VIII.1: 1-4 italics ours). This means that until we reach the real world, we do not believe reality is true. We have chosen to believe instead the ego's lie of separation, which is why we take ourselves and the dream of separation seriously, and are not smiling the smile the Course speaks of, nor laughing \" ... at pain and loss, at sickness and at grief, at poverty, starvation and at death\" (W- pI.187.6:4). Our resistance to learning what is true is the source of our struggle with the Course's teaching, and of our inability to smile peacefully at everything in our lives and our world. Resistance is undone through the process of forgiveness, whereby we look at all the judgments that issue from the choice to identify with the ego, with a little willingness to offer them to the Holy Spirit to be transformed. The process begins with the recognition that our interpretation of every experience is a projection of guilt for having chosen to believe the separation is real. As forgiveness becomes a way of life, guilt and the fear of punishment diminish and the love that is always there slowly dawns upon the mind. This does not happen abruptly. Slowly, fear lessens and glimpses of love's reflection take its place. Gradually it becomes easier and more attractive to identify with the love. When we identify with love, we are \"absorbed\" in it in the sense that it is the only thing we choose. In the text, Jesus tells us: \"When you want only love you will see nothing else\" (T- 12.VII.8:1). Love then extends itself naturally with no interference from the ego. Until then, the many other things we think we want keep us holding on to the ego's guilt and fear, which block love from our awareness. Very early in the text, Jesus tells us we are the same as he, but allow other interests to obscure our awareness: \"There is nothing about me that you cannot attain. I have nothing that does not come from God. The difference between us now is that I have nothing else\" (T-1.II.3:10-12). Our goal is to seek the Holy Spirit's help through forgiveness to remove \"the blocks to the awareness of love's presence\" (T-in.1:7). We will then truly see the humor in the dream, smile gently at our foolishness, and be \"absorbed\" in love."

I thought that the Self (which is one with Christ and God) would have \"made\" separation and thus \"the ego\" would have come into existence?",
    "output": "In the paragraph you cite, self is spelled with a lowercase s, not uppercase. The self Jesus is referring to was \"made out of denial of the Father\" (T-4.III.4:3), as distinguished from Self with an uppercase S, Christ, created by God as an extension of Himself. Christ always remains Christ in Heaven. Once the \"tiny, mad idea\" of separation was taken seriously and became a reality in the Son's mind (not the Mind of Christ), the ego was \"born,\" and the dream of separation from God began. At that point, God's Son, became a decision-making mind that could choose either to remember his true Identity, or choose to deny that and instead be a separate, individualized, limited, vulnerable self. How could we love a self that we made to replace our invulnerable, innocent Self that exists eternally one with infinite Love? How could we truly love something we produced through the rejection of infinite Love, and which we equate with sin? That is why there can never be love in this world. We can reflect the love of Heaven through forgiveness, but love is only in Heaven, which is the \"awareness of perfect Oneness\" (T-18.VI.1:6)."

    "text_input": "Q #725: Are all egos separate little consciousness in their own right or is there just one mind/ consciousness dreaming figures in the dream which have no sentience of their own? In other words, am I the only consciousness that exists and all the persons and animals I see are just unthinking, unseeing, unknowing cardboard cutouts in my field of vision that I have sketched out myself and who are not aware at all? Or, do \"I\" give them their consciousness?",
    "output": "In the \"reality\" of the split mind, there is only one dreamer, the sleeping Son of God, in which consciousness resides. And his dream is one seemingly complex yet seamless whole, encompassing all of time and space. But with the defense against the guilt over separation in this one mind--the seeming fragmentation into billions and billions of seemingly separate minds-- each fragment seems to have its own \"individual consciousness\" (C-in.1:4). And so each individual mind seems to be a separate dreamer, identifying with only a certain specific figure in the larger dream, for particular coordinates of time and space--an essential arrangement in order to experience victimization, the final step in the ego's line of defense to preserve itself. This specific, narrowed focus is readily apparent with our sleeping dreams at night, where our mind identifies with only one of the characters, although the whole dream, including the figure we think we are in the dream, is coming from the sleeping mind. So it is not simply all the other figures in the world that are like cardboard cutouts with no consciousness or life, but also the particular self with which my mind is identifying, which thinks it has eyes and a field of vision. This self is not different from buildings and trees and rivers and mountains and grains of sand (T-28.IV.9:4). Everything in the world is a projection of the one dreaming mind, much like a movie on a screen is a projection of the one piece of film running through the projector. Even the animation of the seemingly separate figures on the screen/in the world is a trick of the mind to make what is a lifeless unitary whole seem to be composed of multiple, separate, and alive figures. Again, it is perhaps easier to recognize that none of the figures in our sleeping dreams has consciousness, including the figure we think we are, and that consciousness resides only in the mind that is asleep and dreaming, but this exactly parallels the nature of our waking dream. There is no consciousness within any seemingly separate aspect of the dream, but there is consciousness behind every aspect, both the so-called animate and the inanimate. Although the experience of individual consciousness is really an ego sleight of mind, it can serve a helpful right-minded purpose. For it means we can each learn to choose between the ego's and the Holy Spirit's way of looking at the dream, and my decision is not dependent on what may seem to be going on in the other fragments of the mind. In other words, none of us can be a victim of others' wrong-minded choices. And so, as Jesus reminds us repeatedly throughout A Course in Miracles, our only responsibility is to accept the Atonement for ourselves (e.g., T- 2.V.5:1; M-7.3:2)."

    "text_input": "Q #726: I have been getting counseling for the last seven months. Recently, the process has become rather painful. I have done a great deal of reading on the subject of transference and I guess I am not the first client who has (or thinks he has) fallen in love with his therapist. I have spoken with her about this, but I am trying to make sense of all my feelings from A Course in Miracles' perspective. Is transference simply the same projection that happens in everyday life? Is it significant that I know very little about her? Is this another example of a special love relationship? Aside from the obvious (a married man falling in love with a woman), what is the role of forgiveness in this situation? Whom do I forgive? I don't even know whom I'm transferring from.",
    "output": "Yes, whenever we feel someone else has something that we don't have--peace, love, insight, answers, etc.-- the situation is ripe for specialness and all the pain that accompanies it. For it reminds us of the guilt and lack we feel within and desperately want to cover over with our fantasies surrounding the new relationship. And this is why the projection works better the less we know about the new person, since the reality of that person will interfere with our fantasy (T- 17.III.4:5-8). Within psychoanalytic theory, transference involves projecting thoughts and feelings associated with other people from the client's past, beginning with the parents, onto the relationship with the therapist. The Course, however, would say that even the parental relationships are not primary, for we have projected the experience of our initial special relationship with God onto our parents. So, in Course terms, transference involves bringing our ego fantasies about God into the relationship with the therapist. And these fantasies would include both special love and special hate, because we have seen God as having what we lack and we have been willing to attack as well as seduce Him in order to attain what we desire. And we must resent Him for not simply giving us the specialness that we want (T-16.V.4:1-2; T-24.III.6). And so the therapist simply has become the current screen onto which these feelings of unrequited specialness are being projected. It is an easy trap to fall into, with the nonjudgmental acceptance and focused attention the therapist most likely offers each visit for that well-defined, circumscribed period of time. And there could be latent if not overt resentment that the time is indeed so limited. And so, yes, the relationship does offer another opportunity to practice forgiveness. But it is not really the therapist, nor any of the shadow figures from your past that you are bringing into the relationship (T-17.III), including God, who need your forgiveness. For each of them is really nothing more than a symbol for the guilt and sin you believe is real in your own mind, from which you believe you need to be saved. And so that is where the forgiveness is really needed, within your own mind. And the Therapist-- the Holy Spirit--also there in your mind, is available to you at any time, in any place or circumstance you need Him, to help you remember the truth about yourself, that you remain God's wholly perfect and innocent Son (T- 10.V.12), no matter what foolish beliefs you cling to about who you really are and what you need to be happy."

    "text_input": "Q #727: I just read an introductory book on the Kabbalah. It said that it is impossible to escape the ego while we are on this earth in the form of a body. This makes sense to me. The Kabbalah talks about achieving a balance of giving and receiving in order to achieve harmony. What do you think?",
    "output": "A Course in Miracles takes very different positions on both of the issues you raise, because it holds a radically different view of who we are and where the world and bodies have come from. Reversing the world's teaching, the Course says we will continue to believe we are in this world in a body until we escape our identification with the ego in our mind, since the experience of the body and the world is the ego's defense to prove that the separation-- and the ego--is real (T- 4.I.4:4-5; T-4.V.4:1-3; T-6.IV.5; T-7.VI.8:1-6; T-23.I.3:3-5; W-pI.68.1:3-4; W-pI.72.2). That is, the world and bodies are the outcome of choosing to identify with the ego--they are simply part of its illusion to convince us that we have indeed separated from God and left our true home in Heaven. And they have worked so well that most of us are now convinced that the body is the problem, that it is the source of our feelings of limitation and pain and unhappiness. In other words, the ego has very cleverly persuaded us to reverse cause and effect in our mind (T-28.II.8- 9). The body, according to the Course, is neutral, and our experience depends simply on what purpose we give the body--either to reinforce our guilt over the separation or to undo it (T- 26.VIII.3:7-8; W-pII.294). From the Course's perspective, giving and receiving must always be \"in balance\" because \"giving and receiving are the same\" (e.g., T-25.IX.10:6; T-26.I.3:6; W-pI.108:6:1; M-2.5:5). This simply reflects the fact that mind is one, so that whatever is given, is given to oneself (W- pI.126). And so this principle applies both to the wrong mind and to the right mind. If we attempt to give guilt to others through projection, we reinforce it in our own mind, receiving what we have attempted to give away or get rid of (T-13.II.1). And if we allow the Holy Spirit to extend His Love through us to others, we too must experience that joy and peace. So any experience of harmony comes not from any balancing act on our part between giving and receiving, but simply from releasing the ego, with its dedication to sin and conflict and pain, and accepting the Holy Spirit as our Teacher. While it is true within the world of form that what we give in terms of objects, money, time, etc. we no longer have (T-5.I.1:10-14), the Course would consider these simply as symbols representing the purpose we hold in our mind, depending on which teacher we have chosen. Giving under the ego's direction will always represent the desire to get rid of our guilt, whatever form it takes, while giving under the Holy Spirit's guidance will always reflect the desire to share love by undoing guilt through forgiveness."

    "text_input": "Q #728: Can affirmations assist in re-learning our relationship with God? I will give some specific examples to make myself clear as to what types of affirmations I am speaking of: \"I am safe in God's love,\" \"I am light and love,\" \"The Christ within me is my peace and abundance,\" \"My brother stems from perfection, he is the Christ\" and so forth. So, in affirming our relationship with God can we come to know Him more?",
    "output": "Although these beautiful statements reflect some of the teachings of A Course in Miracles, their repetition has no real effect on our relationship with God for one very important reason: our true relationship with Him has not been changed in any way by the belief in separation. We are one with God, as we have always been, and will forever be. However, we have forgotten this truth as the result of choosing separation. Since forgetting is the result of choosing separation, remembering comes from not choosing it. This is the simple solution to a simple problem, which we make very complicated by our resistance. If we truly wanted to experience our oneness with God, we would. We resist because, although we think we want to remember God, we are not totally convinced that we want to forget the ego. This is the reflection of the split mind that follows the choice to deny God by choosing the ego. As Jesus tells us in the text: \"Your mind is one with God's. Denying this and thinking otherwise has held your ego together, but has literally split your mind\" (T-4.IV.2:7-8). When the workbook suggests we repeat some of its statements, the intent is for us to train our minds to be attentive to our thoughts and to apply the new thought system we are learning to everything in our lives. The goal of the repetitions is, therefore, the training of our minds \" ... in a systematic way to a different perception of everyone and everything in the world. The exercises are planned to help [us] generalize the lessons, so that [we] will understand that each of them is equally applicable to everyone and everything [we] see\" (W-in.4:1-2). The Course is teaching us to uncover our guilt and bring its darkness to the light of truth, rather than bringing the light to the darkness through affirmations, which conceal the guilt. If our guilt remains hidden it cannot be undone by the truth of our innocence. Thus, the repetitions the Course teaches do not serve the same purpose as affirmations used in other spiritual teachings. Again, one of the most important goals of the Course is to teach us to become increasingly aware of our thoughts of judgment, and to identify their source as the original thought of separation. This training program is necessary because, along with forgetting our oneness with God, we have forgotten that we have a mind that chose to forget. This forgetting is purposeful, since remaining mindless is the ego's great defense. We cannot undo all this purposeful choosing followed by purposeful denial, nor learn of our oneness with God, by affirmations: \"You cannot learn of perfect love with a split mind, because a split mind has made itself a poor learner\" (T-12.V.4:3). Healing the split mind, then, is what we seek in order to remember our immutable relationship with God. The Course teaches that this healing is accomplished through the process of forgiveness, whereby we learn we have a mind and then learn to choose the Holy Spirit rather than the ego. First we must become aware that we have, in fact, chosen to deny God, which is covered by affirmations. Taking responsibility for our choice is the way we learn we have a mind with the power to choose, so we can then make a choice not to deny Him. We learn to recognize this choice reflected in our lives in all the thoughts of separation that flood our days with judgments and attack. Our willingness to see in these thoughts our decision to be separate from God is the beginning of forgiveness, whereby we ultimately accept the release of guilt and fear that block our memory of God. Forgiveness is thus the path the Course teaches to restore our relationship with God to our awareness, by undoing the thought of separation that is the source of our seeming exile in the illusion of the world and the body. If we are clear about these steps in our practice of the workbook, we will not make the mistake of thinking we can bring truth/God to the illusion by having a relationship with Him as bodies. Or, if we do make this mistake, (as we all do), we can quickly return to the practice of the workbook in keeping with the Holy Spirit's curriculum. You may find affirmations helpful as a way to remember to practice the workbook lesson, or to make specific applications of forgiveness during the day, but in themselves they cannot restore God's Love to our awareness. The important thing is learning to be vigilant in observing the thoughts of judgment that reflect back to us the choice to be separate that we have denied. Since it is this denial that keeps \"the blocks to awareness of love's presence\" (T-in.1:7) in place, it is in recognizing the choice we have made and the pain it entails that we will learn we have the power to choose differently and be motivated to do so. That is the path the Course sets forth for us, leading us back to the awareness that we never left our home in God in the first place: \"The journey to God is merely the reawakening of the knowledge of where you are always, and what you are forever. It is a journey without distance to a goal that has never changed\" (T-8.VI.9:6-7)."

    "text_input": "Q #729: Are Buddha and Christ the same, and is Enlightenment some kind of amnesia?",
    "output": "From the point of view of A Course in Miracles, the difference between Buddha and Christ is that Christ always remains part of God in Heaven as \"the perfect Son of God, His one creation and His happiness, forever like Himself and one with Him\" (C-5.3:1). Buddha would be considered, as would any other enlightened being, a symbol within the dream of separation representing the healed mind; that is, the separated mind that has accepted the Atonement and therefore knows the separation to be illusory. Christ, however, was never part of the illusion, but we retain within our minds (the right mind) the memory of our true Identity as Christ. Enlightenment, thus, is a remembrance, not a forgetting (amnesia), unless that were to mean forgetting everything that is not true. In the workbook Jesus explains his idea of enlightenment: \"Why wait for Heaven? Those who seek the light are merely covering their eyes. The light is in them now. Enlightenment is but a recognition, not a change at all. Light is not of the world, yet you who bear the light in you are alien here as well. The light came with you from your native home, and stayed with you because it is your own. It is the only thing you bring with you from Him Who is your Source. It shines in you because it lights your home, and leads you back to where it came from and you are at home\" (W-pI.188.1). See #261 for further comments about the path of Buddhism."

Is there a method to \"heal\" the emotional body? Reading the Course or books by the Dalai Lama, which are all about love, has a very positive effect on me, and I seem to be touching that \"undoing\" moment every now and then, but is there any \"method\" that would make it easier to keep these feelings/attitudes up throughout the day? I found that telling these things \"mentally\" to me, won't always do the job. Neither does \"re-programming\" or any of these \"methods.\" Would regular meditation (with the Course) do? Does Jesus recommend meditation?",
    "output": "The approach of A Course in Miracles to resistance is different from what one would normally expect. Jesus teaches us that what would be most helpful is just to be aware of our resistance and not to fight it or force ourselves --via affirmations, for example--to say and think what we are \"supposed\" to think and say (the exercises in the lessons). An essential part of the healing process is the humble acknowledgment that in one part of our minds we are terrified of accepting the truth about ourselves and therefore strenuously resist learning and practicing the Course. We do not want to lose this self, though false, that we have made such an effort to sustain; we do not want to have to admit that we have been wrong about everything. Those fears would account for our \"forgetting\" or not being able to keep the experiences of the holy instant when we have for the moment set aside our egos. Thus, while this is a course in mind training, the focus of the training is largely on searching our minds for ego thoughts and then looking at them without judgment, while recognizing at the same time that these thoughts are costing us the awareness of the love and peace that also reside in our minds: \"Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all of the barriers within yourself that you have built against it. It is not necessary to seek for what is true, but it is necessary to seek for what is false\" (T-16.IV.6:1-2). The lessons in the workbook are carefully designed to start us off where we are--namely, strongly identified with a physical/emotional self--and gradually lead us inward to the identity we have repressed, that of a decision-making mind that lucidly chooses every minute of every day to reinforce its belief that it is separate from God or to undo that belief through recognizing that we all share the same interest and goal. In general, this is Jesus' approach to resistance. There is nothing wrong in your meditating, if that is helpful to you, but meditation is not a major aspect of the Course's mind-training process. Your concern is shared by most students, and we have discussed it in several other Questions-- see, for example #35, #92, #125, #129, #210, and #302."

    "text_input": "Q #731: I was brought up to believe that God is omnipotent and omniscient, knowing everything that is, that has been, and that ever will be. So before God created the world, He must have known what exactly was going to happen--who was going to go to hell and who wasn't. So if, as A Course in Miracles says, the world is a dream that I am making up, then is what I have written just my ego strategy to hold God responsible for my sin and not myself, to say that I cannot be a sinner because I never really had a choice anyway since it was all pre-ordained in God's Mind? Thus when I stand before God to be judged and my name is not in the book of life, I can present this as my defense to God before being cast into the lake of fire, to avoid damnation or at least to try to. But if God knows everything in advance, then God is powerless to change the future and He cannot be omnipotent. Is this my get-out clause to avoid an imaginary punishment from God, my ego's attempt to be innocent, to see itself or me as just an innocent victim not responsible for its own sin at all, putting the guilt on God and not myself?",
    "output": "You can look at what you've described, as you say, simply as your ego's efforts to shift blame outside yourself onto an unfair, victimizing God, if you note these apparent contradictions but do not seriously question the basic premises you seemed to learn as a child. But you can also look at what you're thinking as the beginning of a right-minded realization that there is something wrong with this traditional concept of God that is found in most religions of the world, where God is the Creator of the world, Who put you here along with everyone else. For there are some logical contradictions in this traditional view of an infinite and perfect God as the Creator of a finite and imperfect world, that many of the greatest religious and spiritual thinkers and philosophers across the ages have not been able to reconcile. The Course is relatively unique among the world's spiritualities in asserting that God has nothing to do with and can in no way be responsible for the limited world of time and space--some of the Gnostic teachings of two thousand years ago held to a similar position and presented arguments much like the ones you offer above (for a comprehensive presentation of these issues as found in the Western spiritual tradition, see Kenneth Wapnick's Love Does Not Condemn: The World, the Flesh, and the Devil According to Platonism, Christianity, Gnosticism, and A Course in Miracles). And of course, the Course goes one step further to assert that this world is an illusion and does not exist in reality (e.g., W-pI.132.6:1-3), despite our experiences to the contrary. If there were any force, personal or impersonal, outside our own minds, that could be held responsible for any aspect of the world and our experience in it, then we would indeed be victims. But the Course's position on this is uncompromising, presented clearly early in the workbook: \"I am not the victim of the world I see\" because \"I have invented the world I see\" (W-pI.31,32). And so it is central to the Course's teaching that neither God nor Jesus nor the Holy Spirit can intervene in either the world or in our minds (e.g., T-2.VII.1:4-6). For if they could, we would not have complete responsibility for our experience, and we could legitimately feel victimized by their failure to intervene. It is the purpose of the Course to return to our awareness the power of our mind to choose, and not to look outside of ourselves to find someone else either to blame or to supplicate. In the Course's own words: \"Let us today be truly humble, and accept what we have made as what it is. The power of decision is our own. Decide but to accept your rightful place as co-creator of the universe [of spirit], and all you think you made [the world of bodies] will disappear. What rises to awareness then will be all that there ever was, eternally as it is now. And it will take the place of self- deceptions made but to usurp the altar to the Father and the Son\" (W-pI.152.8)."

For example, if I am driving and I see a sign in the road that says \"STOP\", and I say to myself, \"This sign does not mean anything,\" I have trouble taking that statement seriously. If I truly believe the sign does not mean anything, then I might keep driving and cause an accident. Do you have any suggestions on how to study this lesson?",
    "output": "The workbook lessons, along with everything A Course in Miracles teaches, are directed to the thoughts we hold in our minds, which derive their meaning in support of the thought system of the ego or that of the Holy Spirit. Belief in the ego gives rise to the world, and gives meaning to everything in it in defense of the separation, while the Holy Spirit's meaning serves to heal the mind of the thought of separation. However, since the separation never happened, everything in the world is meaningless, which is the message of this lesson. In the light of truth a stop sign is meaningless, in the world of the ego, the world we think we inhabit, it means stop. Since the Course is not about changing behavior in the world, the important thing to do at a stop sign is stop. An important goal of the Course is to teach us that truth, not illusion, is meaningful, and that we have a mind with the power to choose between them. Meaning, as it is used in the Course, refers to content, not form. It is very important to keep this distinction in mind in practicing the workbook and studying the Course. Otherwise, we fall victim to level confusion, making it impossible to progress through the training program the workbook sets forth. Your question covers many of the common stumbling blocks found in practicing the workbook lessons. Fortunately, foreseeing our predictable resistance, Jesus has covered all the bases in his instructions in the introduction to the workbook: \"Some of the ideas the workbook presents you will find hard to believe, and others may seem to be quite startling. This does not matter. You are merely asked to apply the ideas as you are directed to do. You are not asked to judge them at all. You are asked only to use them. It is their use that will give them meaning to you, and will show you that they are true\" (W-in.8). A careful review of these instructions will no doubt help you to move along in your practice. We are \"not asked to judge\" the lessons \"at all.\" Therefore, it is not only not necessary to think about them, it is not helpful to do so, as you have discovered. In fact, our thinking has gotten us into a lot of trouble (the dream of separation), which is why the workbook is teaching us a completely new thought system based on what is truly meaningful. Furthermore, we need not judge the lessons, because we cannot judge them due to our upside-down thinking, whereby we have decided what everything is for and think we know what everything means. The workbook lessons, on the other hand, are a puzzle to us; we do not know what they mean. They are specifically designed to teach us that we have everything backwards, since we have taught ourselves (and insist on believing) that illusion is true, and truth is false. This does not mean we should deny the meaning that we have given everything. In fact, part of the answer to your question has been waiting for you in Lesson 2: \"I have given everything ... all the meaning that it has for me.\" Here, Jesus acknowledges our strategy to make the world real by deciding for ourselves what everything is for. We are asked simply to recognize our beliefs and to question them in the light of the teachings of the Course, which tell us we give meaning to everything in the world to defend our belief in the separation and to make the world real. That is the purpose/content the ego assigns to everything, as it is the purpose/content that changes through the practice of forgiveness. Even a stop sign can remind us how attached we are to our belief in the world, which is why the workbook lessons are meant to be applied to everything without intentional exclusion. It can also remind us that we are willing to learn a new way of looking at everything; i.e., seeing its purpose as serving the ego or the Holy Spirit. We thus shift our attention from the form to the content. But until we no longer hold any belief in our identity as bodies in the world, we should stop at stop signs and abide by all the other rules of the world. In fact, even if we were to remain in the body, no longer believing it is who we are, we would still stop at stop signs until we finally put the body down for good. In practicing the workbook, it is very important to remember that Jesus does not expect us to accept or understand its teachings without stumbling and making mistakes. He is considerate of our fear and resistance with his gentle reminder: \"Remember only this; you need not believe the ideas, you need not accept them, and you need not even welcome them. Some of them you may actively resist. None of this will matter, or decrease their efficacy. But do not allow yourself to make exceptions in applying the ideas the workbook contains, and whatever your reactions to the ideas may be, use them. Nothing more than that is required\" (W-in.9, italics ours). If we waited until we were able to do a lesson perfectly, not many of us would get past the first lesson. The important thing is to \"use them\" with willingness to notice the ingenious devices we invent to resist using them. However, \"none of this will matter,\" for, as Jesus tells us in the text: \"Your part is only to offer Him [Holy Spirit] a little willingness ... \" (T-18.V.2:5). Just this \"little willingness\" will lead you from lesson to lesson."

    "text_input": "Q #733: I often hear Ken recounting the mythological tale of sin, guilt and fear the ego tells the Son of God (decision maker). Ken describes the ego as if it were a separate entity. I realize he does this for pedagogical reasons. My understanding is that, once we choose the ego, however, we become the ego. Are we not, at that point, really telling the story to ourselves in an effort to 1) stave off the overwhelming guilt and to 2) preserve our chosen specialness?",
    "output": "Yes, we not only become the ego, we become the \"story.\" However, rather than stave off the guilt, we actually seek it to use as fuel in defense of the belief in sin and to justify fear: \"The attraction of guilt is found in sin, not error. Sin will be repeated because of this attraction ... As an essential part of what the ego thinks you are, you will always want it\" (T-19.III.1:1-2,7). Thus, the story goes: \"I do not remember the sin, but since I feel guilty I must have sinned, and am therefore deserving of punishment by an angry God. My fear, therefore, is clearly justified.\" In the insanity of the ego's \"logic,\" the guilt is then projected out in an attempt to be free of it, while at the same time it is preserved as the ego's foundation. To make matters worse, beyond the attraction for guilt and seeming fear of punishment we find the fear of love: \"The attraction of guilt produces fear of love, for love would never look on guilt at all ... As love must look past fear, so must fear see love not. For love contains the end of guilt, as surely as fear depends on it ... Fear looks on guilt with just the same devotion that love looks on itself\" (T-19.IV-A.10:1,3-4,9). So, guilt is attractive and must be preserved, while love is fearful and must be defended against. What makes love fearful is the realization that in love's presence specialness disappears, and, as you point out, we are dedicated to its preservation. The goal of this psychotic arrangement is to make sin real, which keeps the illusory world of separation real in our experience. Thus the whole story, which has its origin in the choice for separation, is justified, defended, and cherished. The ego predicament is further compounded by the heavy layers of denial that camouflage this story. The best disguise/defense is the projection of these ego dynamics onto God, making Him the One Who hurls His wrathful condemnation upon us for cutting ourselves off from Him. We then seem to have no choice but to protect ourselves through our vast variety of special relationships, designed to project all responsibility for our dilemma out into the world of bodies. The \"story\" thus twists around itself in a seemingly inescapable maze. As bodies, we have no life apart from this dirge. Escape is possible only by undoing this thought of separation/ego, which is the goal of A Course in Miracles. It is accomplished by forgiving ourselves for our madness, beginning with seeing this \"story\" in operation in our lives. Every recognition of the mind's choice for the ego's insanity is an acknowledgement of the power of the mind to choose, and lessens belief in the body/ego identity, even if only slightly and for a brief moment. Willingness to be vigilant in recognizing the ego story without justifying, judging, or defending it is what will eventually lead us beyond it. It is, after all, a lie, and herein lies the hope Jesus offers us in the Course. Forgiveness unravels the story and leads us out of it: \"It looks on lies, but it is not deceived. It does not heed the self-accusing shrieks of sinners mad with guilt. It looks on them with quiet eyes, and merely says to them, 'My brother, what you think is not the truth'\" (W-pI.134.7:3-5). Although it is not easy to see that we do believe we are \"sinners mad with guilt,\" shrieking accusations at ourselves, we must look at this madness as Jesus tells us in this passage. Only then will we learn to accept that this is not our truth, and the lie will be undone."

    "text_input": "Q #734: I was told by a friend who completed A Course in Miracles that we \"should not\" do the lessons in the workbook more than once, as that will give voice to our ego. I would like to do the workbook lessons, text, and manual for teachers for the rest of this illusion of a life here on earth. Please advise.",
    "output": "While there is no need to do the workbook lessons more than once, there is nothing wrong with doing them more than once if you feel so guided. And there certainly can be great value in reading them through more than once. About the only strict guideline the Course offers for how to use its material is not to do more than one workbook lesson a day when you are putting the lessons into practice the first time (W-pI.in.2:6). As with all things, the form of what you are doing is not what is essential, but rather the purpose for which you are doing it--\"what is it for?\" (T-17.VI.2:1-2). Your friend's prohibition may come from a misunderstood but nevertheless legitimate concern that repeating the workbook lessons represents an attempt to do them until you \"get them right,\" which would be falling into the ego's trap of focusing on form rather than content (T-14.X.7:3-5; 8:1-3). Past religious training may have urged repetition of prayers until the offering is purified and pleasing to God, but that is not the goal of the workbook lessons. Their purpose is twofold: to help us realize that we have a right mind as well as a wrong mind, and to learn to desire and thus choose the right mind over the wrong mind more and more of the time, all the while forgiving ourselves when we don't. Another way the ego could be seeking to join your use of the workbook lessons that's helpful to recognize would be any attempt to turn their practice into a ritual--a recurring form from which you seek to gain comfort and relief. As Jesus observes in the workbook, \"Rituals are not our aim, and would defeat our goal\" (W-pI.rIII.in.2:4). This is in fact the ego-based tendency that can be observed in most formal, organized religions--to turn a form, which was only meant to symbolize a living inspiration, into a \"sacred\" or \"holy\" ritual in itself, believing it can be imbued with the content that it was only intended to point to. While it is not a sin to make the workbook lessons into a comforting ritual, it does reduce them to the level of magic and this is certainly not their purpose. In fact, that is why the later lessons have less and less structure built into them, directing us to turn increasingly to our Inner Teacher for guidance. That is their ultimate purpose, so a continuing reliance on the lessons for their own sake can become self- defeating. The Course for most of us is likely to be a process for the rest of our lives, so take with a grain of salt advice that comes from anyone who may claim to have completed it. For as long as we believe our life is here in this world, in the body we think is our identity, regular study of its words, if the Course is our path, will continue to be of value. But rather than simply committing ourselves to a lifetime of regular reading of its text and repeated practice of its 365 lessons, the deeper commitment is to the lifelong practice of its principles in our daily lives, as reflected in the process of forgiveness. The issue of how to do the workbook lessons and whether to repeat them has also been addressed in Questions #64, #92, and #1385."

    "text_input": "Q #735: I understand perfectly how the ego tries to keep us away from our Creator, my question is what is the nature of the ego? What kind of entity is it? Why are we born with egos? Can it be compared with Satan or evil forms? What is the test to distinguish each voice (the ego's and the Holy Spirit's)? Does the ego have any useful purpose in our lives?",
    "output": "The ego is not an entity of itself. Jesus speaks of it as if it were a separate, autonomous thing in order to \"persuade you that you cannot dismiss it lightly, and must realize how much of your thinking is ego-directed\" (T-4.VI.1:4). It is, though, \"nothing more than a part of your belief about yourself ... the part of the mind that believes your existence is defined by separation\" (T- 4.VI.1:6; VII.1:5). Interestingly, Jesus redefines the traditional biblical notion of the devil to mean this belief in separation (T-3.VII.5:1), which he expands on by saying that this belief \"is powerful, active, destructive and clearly in opposition to God, because it literally denies His Fatherhood. Look at your life and see what the devil has made. But realize that this making will surely dissolve in the light of truth, because its foundation is a lie\" (T-3.VII.5:2-4). Thus, we only deceive ourselves when we believe we have separated from God, and in so doing bring a great amount of pain into our minds. All that we need do about this is bring that lie to the truth in us and it will be dissolved. This is Atonement without sacrifice (T-3.I). Why are we born with egos? The assumption here is that there is a self that is born, an assumption A Course in Miracles teaches is false and that it sets out to correct. In fact, we are advised to have the willingness to question every value we hold if we are to learn this course (T- 24.in.2:1), and that includes all of our beliefs about who we are and how the world works. Briefly, thus, the Course teaches us that it is the mind that decides to split off from its identity as a mind and become an individualized bodily self in order to keep the separation a reality. That is the origin of all bodies; in other words, bodies are the outcome of the mind's strategy to preserve its existence as a separate entity. But since ideas leave not their source, the body is never anything other than a thought in the mind, and an expression in form of the mind's dynamics of self-preservation and salvation from guilt. Because of space limitations, we cannot go into this any further, but recommend that you have a look at #354, and then perhaps study the first five paragraphs of \"The 'Hero' of the Dream\" (T-27.VIII) and the first two paragraphs in \"The Secret Vows\" (T-28.VI), sections that help fill in some of the details of the Course's view of the body. Many, many people ask how to distinguish the ego's voice from the Holy Spirit's. While this discernment can be a problem, Jesus talks explicitly about it in several places. Since specialness is one of our most powerful defenses against awareness of our oneness with each other, he points out that our demand for specialness is one sure way to block out the Voice for God: \"You can defend your specialness, but never will you hear the Voice for God beside it. They speak a different language and they fall on different ears\" (T-24.II.5:1-2). This is pretty clear, but still there are times when we will not know for sure. We have responded to this concern in Questions #285, #309, #486, and #536, all of which we hope will be helpful. Finally, the ego is useful to us to the extent to which we see our lives as classrooms in which we are being taught, if we choose Jesus or the Holy Spirit as our Teacher, how we can awaken from the nightmare of separation from God. In that sense, we can redirect the use of everything of the ego to serve the Holy Spirit's purpose. He will use everything that we made to harm for the purpose of healing our minds (T-25.VI.4). See also T-24.VII.6 and T-29.VI.5."

But what is the best way to overcome these feelings, to manage the moments of anxiety? When I feel I've passed almost all the ego's tests, my weight becomes an issue, and any perfection I feel I've reached is meaningless because I'm not good looking or thin. How can I deal with that? I feel I have tried everything.",
    "output": "A Course in Miracles would say the problem in the end is not what we think of our bodies or our personalities or other aspects of our individual selves, but that we think of ourselves as bodies at all. Our perfection has nothing to do with the body, for perfection is only of the spirit, which is already perfect (T-2.V.1:8) and can never be lacking in any way. Now, obviously, most of us still identify with this individual self and Jesus is not asking us to deny our experiences and feelings--that would serve no helpful purpose. But it is helpful to recognize that his Course ultimately is leading us beyond any bodily identification (e.g., T-1.I.29:3;), so that we can begin to put our anxieties and concerns in a greater context. Our anxieties and bodily concerns keep us anchored in the ego's thought system (T-29.II.9-10). There is really nothing to be done about them, except to acknowledge the feelings when they arise and recognize that their purpose is to reinforce the belief we all hold that we are separate, vulnerable, and unlovable. Our perception of our body will shift as we change under whose guidance we place our mind--and this has nothing to do with any physical changes in the body itself but only the purpose we see in it. As Jesus explains, \"The body is beautiful or ugly, peaceful or savage, helpful or harmful, according to the use to which it is put ... If the body becomes a means you give to the Holy Spirit to use on behalf of union of the Sonship, you will not see anything physical except as what it is. Use it for truth and you will see it truly. Misuse it and you will misunderstand it, because you have already done so by misusing it. Interpret anything apart from the Holy Spirit and you will mistrust it. This will lead you to hatred and attack and loss of peace\" (T-8.VII.4:3-9). And by misusing the body, Jesus means that we see our own body as the means of having our individual specialness needs met, while we see our brothers' bodies as the cause of all our suffering and unhappiness, either for their attacks that inflict pain directly, or for what they fail to do that we would have them do for us. In contrast to the ego's use, the Holy Spirit would have us recognize that the body is only the screen onto which we have projected our mind's guilt over our belief in separation and attack. And with that recognition we can then release the guilt in the mind to the Holy Spirit, so that our body can now become an instrument for communicating His Love and forgiveness. In the paragraphs preceding the lines just quoted, Jesus observes: \"Remember that the Holy Spirit interprets the body only as a means of communication. Being the Communication Link between God and His separated Sons, the Holy Spirit interprets everything you have made in the light of what He is. The ego separates through the body. The Holy Spirit reaches through it to others. You do not perceive your brothers as the Holy Spirit does, because you do not regard bodies solely as a means of joining minds and uniting them with yours and mine. This interpretation of the body will change your mind entirely about its value. Of itself it has none. If you use the body for attack, it is harmful to you. If you use it only to reach the minds of those who believe they are bodies, and teach them through the body that this is not so, you will understand the power of the mind that is in you. If you use the body for this and only for this, you cannot use it for attack. In the service of uniting it becomes a beautiful lesson in communion, which has value until communion is. This is God's way of making unlimited what you have limited. The Holy Spirit does not see the body as you do, because He knows the only reality of anything is the service it renders God on behalf of the function He gives it\" (T-8.VII.2- 3). You may also find either the audio or the small book, both titled Overeating: A Dialogue, by Kenneth Wapnick, helpful with your issues around weight and the body's appearance."

    "text_input": "Q #737: If all love relationships are a defense against the pain that comes from rejection of God's Love, then is it bad to get married? Am I wrong in thinking of having a holy family as I always dreamt of?",
    "output": "It is not wrong to get married or have a family, just as it is not wrong to do any of the things we do in the world. In fact, it is important that we do all the things we want to do, precisely because we dream of them. Having chosen separation and identification with the body, everything we do is part of the dream of separation. A Course in Miracles does not ask that we deny ourselves any of the things we think we want, nor that we change our behavior in any way. Rather, its goal is to help us understand the purpose the ego has given to everything (to make the separation real), and to teach us to allow the Holy Spirit to use what we have made for a different purpose (to undo the thought of separation). The world we dream about is the classroom in which we learn to awaken from the dream, and family life in particular is a very important part of the process. It is the home of the special relationships we think we need to fill the void left by the separation. The Holy Spirit needs these special relationships so they can be transformed: \"In His function as Interpreter of what you made, the Holy Spirit uses special relationships, which you have chosen to support the ego, as learning experiences that point to truth. Under His teaching, every relationship becomes a lesson in love\" (T-15.V.4:5-6). To deny that we want them is to deprive ourselves of the very conditions the Holy Spirit needs to teach us forgiveness. Everything we seek in the world is a defense in several ways: a defense of the belief that the separation is real, a defense against God's Love that we have rejected and now fear, a defense against the pain of rejecting Love by seeking comfort in our special relationships. Jesus asks that we recognize that this defense strategy of the ego is the result of the mind's choice for separation without justifying it, or judging it as \"bad.\" It is not bad or sinful, because it has no real effects. This means that however much we believe we are bodies living in the world, the truth of who we are remains unchanged. We begin the forgiveness process by not denying that we believe we are bodies wanting to do all kinds of things in the world. Then our only function is to be willing to look without judgment at our beliefs, seeing in them all our thoughts of specialness, based on the insatiable feeling of need engendered by the separation that we project onto all our relationships. By the very fact of being willing to see the ego thought system in operation in our \"dreams\" and desires, they become the Holy Spirit's classroom: \"However unholy the reason you made them may be, He can translate them into holiness by removing as much fear as you will let Him. You can place any relationship under His care and be sure that it will not result in pain, if you offer Him your willingness to have it serve no need but His\" (T-15.V.5:3-4). That is our goal in studying the Course. It is how what we have made to defend the belief in separation can be used to undo it. Thus, it is not only not bad to get married and have the family you have always wanted, it is important that you do so. What will bring healing to these special relationships is inviting the Holy Spirit to be with you as you marry and have children, as well as willingness to apply His lessons of forgiveness in your family life. It is the Holy Spirit Who will make it a holy family: \"The Holy Spirit knows no one is special. Yet He also perceives that you have made special relationships, which He would purify and not let you destroy ... All the guilt in it arises from your use of it. All the love from His. Do not, then, be afraid to let go your imagined needs, which would destroy the relationship. Your only need is His\" (T-15.V.5:1-2,5-7). Best wishes for a happy marriage."

How does this square with another oft-quoted passage from near the beginning of the text: \"I have already indicated that you cannot ask me to release you from fear. I know it does not exist, but you do not. If I intervened between your thoughts and their results, I would be tampering with a basic law of cause and effect; the most fundamental law there is.\" (T-2.VII.1:2-4)",
    "output": "Since you submitted your question, a couple of answers, Questions #514i and #577, have been posted that respond to the issue you raise. (See also Question #363.) But we will address your specific question briefly here and you can look at those other answers for further explanation. The key is the temporal aspect of karma inherent in its law of cause and effect. The Course does not deny the law of cause and effect in the mind, outside of time and space. In fact, its whole teaching on forgiveness, with the contrast between choosing the ego and the Holy Spirit, is based on the premise that each decision has very different consequences (T-8.I.5:1-2). Where the Course differs from the world's law of karma is in its assertion that cause and effect occur simultaneously (W-pI.19.1:4) in the mind and do not require time to unfold in the world. The world in fact was made by the ego to interpolate an apparent delay between our thoughts and their effects, merely a deception to convince us that time, space, and the separation are real. In the passage you cite, Jesus is emphasizing this point, that we are responsible for the effects of our decisions in our mind and he would be going counter to everything the Course is teaching if he were to intervene in our mind and take away the fear that is the immediate result of our choice for the ego. Jesus is not referring to anything that is happening in the world, where the law of karma operates, because from his perspective, the world is not real (W-pI.155.2:1)."

And given that we appear to be bodies as a consequence of our separation from God, wouldn't the attainment of knowledge be incompatible with our continued existence as human beings?",
    "output": "The meaning of enlightenment varies in different mystical traditions; but for the most part, Eastern notions would be what the Course defines as \"the real world\"--when the mind is totally healed of all sense of separation and therefore of sin, guilt, and fear. In A Course in Miracles knowledge belongs exclusively to the pre-separation world of God and His unified creation in which there are no differences or forms. It therefore has nothing to do with the world of perception. It refers only to the pure experience of non-duality, with no subject-object dichotomy. Strictly speaking, it is not a state we attain. Rather, we gradually come to recognize the means we have been using to deny our natural state of oneness with our Source. We realize the frightful cost of that, and then we choose against that denial. When we make that choice once and for all without reservation, we are simply choosing to be as God created us, One Son, perfectly united with God. Is this state incompatible with existence as a human being? Jesus answers that by stating: \"If God were reached directly in sustained awareness, the body would not be long maintained\" (M-26.3:8). Those who have this awareness are the \"Teachers of teachers,\" so named \"because, although they are no longer visible, their image can yet be called upon\" (M-26.3:2). Thus, we need reflections of perfect love to appear to us in a form we can understand and relate to; and for most of us that is a human form."

    "text_input": "Q #740: A Course in Miracles can be seen as lying within the Judaeo-Christian monotheistic tradition, characterized by considering God as outside of the earthly system. This tradition, which originated with the patriarchal sky/mountain God of the Hebrews, became dominant over the preceding religious systems as much as anything else through violent imposition. In earlier \"pagan\" polytheism, God/Goddess was/were considered present within the earthly realm in multiple forms, such as tree or river Gods, etc. It is obvious that a believed presence of God within the natural world produces a respect for its resources, whereas an earthly realm in which God does not lie openly invites their violation. In this way, Judaeo-Christian monotheism can be seen to have played a huge part in environmental degradation, and so this can also be viewed as a weakness of the Course.  How would you answer this criticism?",
    "output": "While we remain identified with our egos, we can use anything we want to justify and rationalize our self-centered thoughts and subsequent actions, including any spiritual teaching, no matter how profound and all-inclusive its message of love may be. And so it is true, we could choose to use the Course's teachings on the unreality of the world and God's total lack of involvement in it--He's not even the world's creator, as the Judaeo-Christian theologies would maintain, so there's nothing at all sacred about it!--to justify treating the illusion in any way we please, using it to meet our own personal needs at everyone and everything else's expense. And yet such an interpretation would require a total misreading of the Course, for it would go completely counter to everything Jesus is saying, since the Course's aim at the very beginning of our study of it--the most preliminary step along its path--is to lead us to a recognition of shared rather than separate interests (M-1.1:2). And this sharing, through the process of forgiveness, is to be extended to every aspect of the Sonship, even the tiniest grain of sand (T-28.IV.9:4), and not only to fellow homo sapiens, or our own family or ethnic group or country, or some other grouping based both on exclusion and inclusion. While it is true in one sense that the Course comes within the Judaeo-Christian tradition, it must be understood that it does for solely one purpose: to provide a gentle and loving correction for all the ego-based errors of that other system of thought. It does not build upon nor extend that tradition, but rather takes its central concepts, which have been used unfortunately for hatred and attack and murder, and allows them to be given a different purpose--the healing of the mind of the Sonship. It would be a serious confusion to equate the Course's non-dualistic theology of the oneness and guiltlessness of all with the dualistic teachings of sin and guilt enshrined in the Judaeo-Christian tradition."

I was watching it and these feelings and thoughts started running through me like wanting to raise money so that people will not feel that they are bereft of hope, wanting others to see this so we can at least look abortion right in the eye. I also began contemplating what we would do if a fetus began to fight back. Then another part of me said what does it matter if we are all going to die anyway? Is not abortion murder? Is it okay and in keeping with the message of A Course in Miracles that I want abortions to be minimized?",
    "output": "The Course simplifies the many moral dilemmas we encounter here in the dream of separation by reinterpreting everything we believe about everything, including, and especially, \"life\" and \"death.\" We are told: \"There is no life outside of Heaven. Where God created life, there life must be. In any state apart from Heaven life is illusion. At best it seems like life; at worst, like death (T-23.II.19:1-3, italics ours). The body (dead or alive), like the world, is an illusion. The mind that shares life with God does not reside in the body, and is outside time and space. Whatever happens to the body, then, has no effect on the mind, which means it has no effect. Illusion cannot have any effect on reality. These important teachings of the Course make it clear that neither abortion nor anything else in the dream is morally right or wrong. It is nothing, because the body is nothing: \"The body no more dies than it can feel. It does nothing. Of itself it is neither corruptible nor incorruptible. It is nothing\" (T-19.IV-C.5:2-4). It is inconsistent with the teachings of the Course to use its principles to support or reject any specific behavior in the world (form). The Course addresses itself to the mind, and its teachings apply to the thoughts in the mind (content), not the body. The only real murderous act that the Son of God commits is to choose to believe that separation from God is possible. Once that choice is made, identification with the ego's thought system of sin, guilt, and fear follows. With or without abortion it's all downhill from there. If the thought of fetuses dying is fearful, and you feel moved to protect them, it is not wrong to do so. It is no different from taking precautions against disease and sickness, or protecting the environment. Since we believe we are bodies living in the world, and take ourselves very seriously, it is important to look at all the judgments around certain behaviors such as abortion, war, and other acts of violence and aggression. They show us the beliefs we hold in our minds about ourselves and others, and they are the specific forms we have chosen to reflect the mind's choice for separation. The form thus becomes the classroom for the forgiveness lessons whereby the separation thought is undone. A situation such as abortion offers a multitude of opportunities to either reinforce the ego's guilt, or strengthen the mind's identification with the Holy Spirit. It is the choice made in the mind to identify with the ego or the Holy Spirit that is important, not the specific behavior. One could make a loving and peaceful choice with the Holy Spirit to have an abortion, just as it is possible to choose the ego and organize against abortion filled with judgment, condemnation, and \"murderous\" thoughts against those having abortions or performing them. The specific behavior may vary; it does not matter. What matters is making a choice that lessens guilt, and strengthens identity with the Holy Spirit. A peaceful decision can only be made when the fear, guilt, and judgment in the mind has been recognized and released, to whatever extent possible. It is helpful to remember an important message Jesus gives us in the text: \"You do not know the meaning of anything you perceive. Not one thought you hold is wholly true. The recognition of this is your firm beginning\" (T-11.VIII.3:1-3). To truly ask the Holy Spirit for help means not having decided ahead of time what the answer should be, which means letting go of every judgment and value that we hold. If we cannot let them go, we can at least question them and admit to ourselves and to the Holy Spirit that we think we know what is best, not only for ourselves but for everyone else. Jesus repeats in many passages in the Course that we do not know. One of our biggest mistakes is believing that life in a body is of supreme value, and one of our greatest fears is that we are wrong. Since we hold tight to this belief and to our fear, we do well to proceed gently through the process of learning to make decisions with the Holy Spirit rather than with the ego. It does not help to deny how much we value our identity as bodies. While we do whatever we feel we must to protect our version of life, we can remember the early workbook lessons: \"I do not perceive my own [or anyone else's] best interests\" (W-pI.24), because \"I do not know what anything is for\" (W-pI.25). Willingness to keep these thoughts in mind is an invitation to the Holy Spirit to be with you in whatever you do with regard to abortion or anything else. It also opens the way to the part of the mind where the memory of true life, ours and everyone's, resides."

    "text_input": "Q #742: In The Most Commonly Asked Questions About A Course in Miracles Ken and Gloria stated the desire to be thought of and seen as a \"spiritual person\" or a \"loving\" person is an expression of specialness. But, on the other hand I feel I am wearing a mask for others when I hide my love for Jesus and God and A Course in Miracles. Do you understand? I WANT people to know how much I love Jesus and to know how much this sometimes torturous path is a part of my life.\tI read Ken somewhere saying that if you really love someone you do not have to go around announcing it, but Jesus said in the Course that we \"will be as eager to share our learning\" as he is.\tCan you comment on this please?",
    "output": "The distinction between form and content might be of some help in resolving your dilemma. Avoiding the trap of specialness does not mean that you must hide the love you have for Jesus, God, and A Course in Miracles. That love is the content in your mind. When you are identified with that love, and that is what motivates you, you do not choose the form in which that content gets expressed. You are not concerned with form at all. Love will automatically flow through you in the form that is most helpful to everyone. In that sense, you just step back and let love lead the way. In fact, when you are identified with love, the sense of you as a person with needs, desires, and demands disappears; you are just more peaceful; you take nothing personally; and you smile more frequently (see Lesson 155 [W-pI.155.1]). This is not a mask. Jesus asks of us: \"Teach not that I died in vain. Teach rather that I did not die by demonstrating that I live in you\" (T-11.VI.7:3-4). In the Introduction to the manual for teachers, Jesus discusses further this approach to teaching; namely, that we teach by demonstrating (M-in.1-3). Sharing what we have learned is not necessarily done through words, as the passages cited explain. It is perfectly normal to feel enthusiastic, but if you feel a need to talk about your love for Jesus--that you must-- then you have slipped back into your ego, for when you truly love him, you are completely quiet inside; you rest content in that quiet center in your mind, knowing that your love for him and his for you is the only reality. Nothing else compels you. On the other hand, \"this sometimes torturous path\" can produce conflict and fear; and then it could be helpful to turn to someone who would be understanding and compassionate. We all need that at times, until we have set aside our egos. But that is quite different from wanting others to know how important this spiritual path is to you. That could be a way of making yourself different from others: \"Look how spiritual I am and how hard I work at this.\" The ego sneaks into the process in rather subtle ways at times."

    "text_input": "Q #743: Why does the textbook say God feels lonesome if we do not share communication/ creativity with \"him\"? I thought that God does not even know of this world of separation, then how can he feel lonely? Is this again a question related to the two levels A Course in Miracles is written in?--Which level is the \"real\" one, and why should we bother with level two (the dream- world)? Doesn't the request for joining God raise feelings of guilt in the ego? Does ACIM say anything positive about why we are \"here\"?",
    "output": "The Course uses metaphors, and in form has many contradictory passages. That is why it cannot be read and understood exclusively on an intellectual level. Its content and loving message of forgiveness can only be understood with the willingness of the mind that opens to the truth that it reflects. The Course's teaching that the world is an illusion and the separation never happened is seemingly contradicted by the very fact that the Course itself exists in form. Clearly then, from its inception the Course lovingly accommodates its form to be helpful to the terrified, guilt-ridden part of the mind of God's Son who believes he is irretrievably lost because of his terrible sin. According to the ego's logic, the guilt that follows the \"sin\" of separation engenders tremendous fear of punishment from an angry God. When the Course tells us God weeps and is lonely without us (T-5.VII.4; T-2.III.5), the message is that He is not an angry, vengeful God, but One Who loves us and misses us. These symbolic images are helpful to us who are able to relate to the concept of a loving father more easily than the abstract nature of God. As Jesus tells us: \"You cannot even think of God without a body, or in some form you think you recognize\" (T-18.VIII.1:7). This single line explains the metaphors used in the Course, as well as the levels of teaching. Since we believe we are in the world, Jesus teaches us from our level of experience. Having chosen to identify with the body, we think and act and \"reason\" like bodies, so the Course comes to us in a form we can understand, and uses numerous metaphors, poetic imagery, and symbols to speak to us of the Love we have denied and forgotten. From the ego's perspective, everything is guilt provoking. Its \"life\" issues from the thought of separation and depends on the guilt that ensues to sustain it. The ego interprets the call to return home to God as proof that the separation is real. It does not accept the real message that tells us we never left our home in God. If the Course is read with the ego as interpreter, there is much that can be used to instill fear and increase guilt. That is the ego's goal in every experience, and the Course is no exception. In fact, the Course tells us that is how the ego functions: \"Whenever you respond to your ego you will experience guilt, and you will fear punishment\" (T-5.V.3:6). Only what is true is \"real.\" Since \"the world is an illusion\" (W-pI.155.2:1) i.e., not real/true, everything in it is also not real, including us, as bodies. It is only our belief that we are bodies in the world that makes it necessary for Someone from outside the illusion to lead us out of it by meeting us on our \"level.\" The only reason we should bother with the world, which we made to keep ourselves separate from God, is as a classroom to learn the Holy Spirit's curriculum of forgiveness. The Holy Spirit needs what we have made to lead us back to Him by teaching us that not only will our world/body not make us happy, it is not real. So the only positive things the Course says about our seeming existence in the world, is that it is an illusion that can serve as a classroom. With understanding of what we think is our reality and loving respect for the part of our own minds that knows otherwise, Jesus gives a hope-filled answer to why we are here: \"Nothing the body's eyes seem to see can be anything but a form of temptation [to believe the separation is real], since this was the purpose of the body itself. Yet we have learned that the Holy Spirit has another use for all the illusions you have made, and therefore He sees another purpose in them. To the Holy Spirit, the world is a place where you learn to forgive yourself what you think of as your sins. In this perception, the physical appearance of temptation becomes the spiritual recognition of salvation\" (W-pI.64.2)."

    "text_input": "Q #744: Why does A Course in Miracles sometimes seem absurd to me? I do read it with great pleasure every evening (one chapter and one exercise). Still, I wonder why I should do these exercises at all when the Atonement is already done and it never existed. After all with \"separation/sin\" came also its remedy (Holy Spirit)? Why if we are guiltless in our divine nature, the Son(s and daughters) of God, Christ consciousness, should we do these exercises? Why does Jesus invest so much into this our dream world? Doesn't he invest in something that is not real, and thus makes it real for us? Shouldn't we then wake Jesus and tell him it really isn't necessary? Is that what Jesus talks of if he asks us to forgive him?",
    "output": "The continued practice of the Course helps us move from the intellectual acceptance of the Atonement to the experience of it. Those of us who still are personally affected by what goes on in our world--both personal and the world at large--clearly do not believe that these occurrences are illusory or simply segments of a dream. We would take nothing seriously if we did. In making this transition, though, Jesus advises us not to attempt to deny our bodily experiences. For one thing, he says, \"it is almost impossible to deny its [the body's] existence in this world\"; and \"those who do so are engaging in a particularly unworthy form of denial\" (T- 2.IV.3:10-11). Ultimately, Jesus is a symbol of the part of our minds that contains the memory of our true Identity. He represents the love that we have split off and replaced with the identities we have as individuals. Since we are convinced that we are individuals living in a real physical universe, then he must communicate to us on that level--but only in order to teach us that we are mistaken, and that there is a way of living in this world that will enable us to recognize its illusory nature and that we are minds choosing to believe that we are not. Jesus is not the problem, our tenacious hold on the ego's belief system is the problem. He is present to us in the most gentle way possible: a loving, non-judgmental presence in our minds inviting us to choose his love instead of the ego's specialness, and to recognize that everyone else shares in that love as well. That joining is what undoes our belief in separation, which is the only thing interfering with our returning to the home where God would have us be. #98 provides further commentary and also suggests a few readings that might be of help."

    "text_input": "Q #745: Please comment on the relationship between time and forgiveness, according to the teachings of A Course in Miracles. Understanding that time is not linear, we do sometimes experience a lessening of hostilities against another with the \"passing\" of time, much like the \"time heals all wounds\" adage. Is this just another part of the self-deception that makes time appear real? Or, is it an indication that we have chosen to truly forgive on the level of mind, which then becomes manifest in this way? Thank you for any help you can provide.",
    "output": "There would be no way of knowing for certain with a particular person, where the anger and condemnation seem to have lessened over time, whether the apparent shift is the result of genuine forgiveness or merely symptom substitution, that is, the guilt originally projected onto that person simply being redirected onto somebody else. In the latter case, the experience may be more that this old special hate partner is just not worth the energy it takes to hate anymore, for we have more immediate special hate partners who demand our attention now! On the other hand, if we have been practicing forgiveness with other relationships in our lives, even if our focus has not been on somebody specifically whom we'd judged without forgiving in the past, we are in effect reducing our identification with the guilt in our own mind. And that is where the only real problem lies, for we are never really angry at others for what they have done, but only for what it reminds us we secretly accuse ourselves of (T-31.III.1:5-6; 2:1-3). And so it is possible, without any active attempt to generalize forgiveness to this specific special hate partner, that we would simply find that we have no need any longer to hold this person responsible for our own pain and unhappiness. It would not be the passage of time but rather the practice of forgiveness over time in other contexts that has released this old special hate partner from our projections."

    "text_input": "Q #746: If the Holy Spirit knows everything, which Jesus assures us that He does, then why cannot He guide me to help all those suffering in the world. Let us say for example a child has been kidnapped and is missing. Why can't I ask the Holy Spirit to tell me where the child is so I can help return the child to her family? Surely, the Holy Spirit knows exactly where the child is.",
    "output": "Yes, the Holy Spirit is the only One who knows exactly where the child is: at home in God where he never left, and from where he never was kidnapped. If the Holy Spirit were to intervene in the way that you describe, it would mean the separation did in fact occur, the world and the body were real, and the ego was right all along. That is not what we want the Holy Spirit to do. The Holy Spirit also knows that we are all suffering in the world, and He has come to help us end our suffering by showing us the way out of the world of illusion. When the mind chooses to identify with the ego/body, it becomes totally confused. Not only is our true Identity as God's innocent Son denied, identity with the mind is forgotten in the bargain. Thus we are all lost, kidnapped by the belief in the separation. That is the real problem, for which the Holy Spirit offers a real solution: the undoing of the thought of separation through forgiveness. Since the Holy Spirit is not part of the dream of separation, He does not know specifically where anyone is in the illusion. He knows everything we need to know, but nothing that is not true. He could not, therefore, tell anyone how to find someone in a world that doesn't exist. His concern is only with the mind that thinks the world is real, and has the ability to choose to defend this belief or accept His perspective. However, the Holy Spirit knows that we have identified with the body, and knows the pain we experience for having left our true home by choosing the world: \"Here [the world] is the only home he thinks he knows. Here is the only safety he believes that he can find. Without the world he made is he an outcast; homeless and afraid. He does not realize that it is here he is afraid indeed, and homeless, too; an outcast wandering so far from home, so long away, he does not realize he has forgotten where he came from, where he goes, and even who he really is\" (W-pI.166.4:1-4). This describes the lost child in all of us. For by choosing to believe the ego and identify with the body, we have lost our home, our Identity, and our Source. Moreover, we have no idea how to get Them back. This is where the Holy Spirit enters with His plan of salvation. Helping us find our way back to our true home and Identity is the goal of His curriculum in A Course in Miracles. He does this by teaching us that we have a mind with the power to choose against separation, just as we chose for it. This change is the miracle He teaches. We who believe we are in the world, on the other hand, are more interested in fixing things in the world: magic. Driven by the desire to make the world real, the mind's power is used to manipulate form, rather than to choose to see differently. Because we are unwilling to take responsibility for the power of our minds and are afraid of it, we deny it and blame external events on external causes, instead of recognizing that it is only the mind that is truly active. Thus, the mind that chose to be lost can choose to be found, and the mind that experiences anxiety due to the choice for separation can turn to the Holy Spirit to find peace. We must first recognize our fear of losing our identity as bodies, which is the ego's \"lost child.\" Then we can turn to the Holy Spirit to find our \"lost\" identity as God's Son, through forgiveness of all our thoughts of judgment and attack. The symbol of a lost child applies as well to the thoughts of judgment we have projected out to make our separation from God real in our experience. This leaves us feeling lost, abandoned, and hopeless. The Holy Spirit invites us to \"come home\" to our minds by retrieving these thoughts: \"We take our wandering thoughts, and gently bring them back to where they fall in line with all the thoughts we share with God. We will not let them stray. We let the light within our minds direct them to come home. We have betrayed them, ordering that they depart from us. But now we call them back, and wash them clean of strange desires and disordered wishes\" (W- pI.188.9:2-6). Our \"strange desires\" to be special and separate are thus healed, and we are found at last.

Isn't it better just to think of a corpus of wrong ideas we have created of ourselves that serves the simple purpose of giving wrong answers when facing a situation? Isn't it just a point of reference with which to compare the divine peace of Heaven? Why do we have to see it as such an entity? In my case this idea contributed to building a new kind of fear I had to deal with.",
    "output": "In A Course in Miracles, Jesus tells us exactly what the ego is: \"What is the ego? But a dream of what you really are. A thought you are apart from your Creator and a wish to be what He created not. It is a thing of madness, not reality at all. A name for namelessness is all it is. A symbol of impossibility; a choice for options that do not exist. We name it but to help us understand that it is nothing but an ancient thought that what is made has immortality. But what could come of this except a dream which, like all dreams, can only end in death?\" (C-2.1:4-11; italics ours) The ego cannot then be an entity; it has no substance. It is the thought of separation, which is given power only by a choice in the mind to believe that it is true. The ego/thought exists in our experience because we want it to. We choose it over the Holy Spirit because we prefer our specialness as separate bodies to our truth as God's innocent Son. We fear it because we fear the power of our minds that would recognize the nothingness of the ego. If the ego is nothing, so is the world and so is the body. That recognition is terrifying to those who cling to specialness in a body. The world and the body arise in our experience as the result of choosing to identify with the thought of separation (ego) in the mind. Thus, the ego is not a thing outside of ourselves that exists on its own, acting as an agent that can tempt us to anything. We alone are responsible for bringing it into existence by believing in it and allowing it to thrive on the guilt that inevitably follows the choice to be other than the Son that God created. We would prefer to believe that the ego has a life of its own so we could dissociate from it. That would allow us to have our cake and eat it too; i.e., have an ego-free life as bodies outside of Heaven. However, Jesus tells us in the Course that neither the ego nor the body exists, because nothing exists outside of Heaven: \"Life not in Heaven is impossible, and what is not in Heaven is not anywhere\" (T-23.II.19:6). To ears that cling to \"life\" in a body this is not good news, and does indeed seem to instill fear. The fear, however, comes only from unwillingness to accept that truth be true. Yet in this same statement lies our hope for escape from the nightmare of separation. It tells us the ego has no life, and therefore no power and no effects. In another passage we are told: \"It [the ego] has no meaning. It does not exist. Do not try to understand it because, if you do, you are believing that it can be understood and is therefore capable of being appreciated and loved. That would justify its existence, which cannot be justified\" (T-7.VI.11:6-9). That is good news. We are free to fix our attention on the path of forgiveness that is our only function here, and let the thought of separation be gradually undone. The ego, like the world, will then \"fade into the nothingness from which it came ... \" (M-13.1:2)"

Yes, we have invested heavily and almost exclusively in the ego thought system, and our losses have mounted accordingly. A diversified portfolio is always a wiser approach! And, yes, Jesus is showing us how to write off this bad debt. We could not find a better financial advisor. Unfortunately, we have not been listening to what he has been telling us for eons. Thankfully, he's still saying it, and we will never run out of chances to change our minds and turn back to him as our advisor. Essentially he is showing us how we got into trouble and how to get out of it, without losing anything of value. What a deal! The only condition is that we muster up the humility to question our own judgment and agree to learn how to judge everything with him, which should not be hard to do, given our dismal performance thus far. Accepting him as our advisor is the best decision we could ever make, because it will give us everything we truly have longed for, and no sacrifice will ever have been asked. A no brainer!"

    "text_input": "Q #749: The field of quantum mechanics has finally reached a point (string theory) where it acknowledges that nothing exists except energy--and that this world is in fact an illusion. Is approaching the unreality of the world through this avenue still an example of the ego trying to make it real (if only in an energy format)? And is seeing it as a \"field of intent connected to the Source,\" as Dr. Wayne Dyer proclaims, really only one more mistaken way to explain the illusion of the world? Or are these two, pure physics and metaphysics, actually getting close to the truth as the A Course in Miracles would see it? And will their approach ever lead them to the Course's view?",
    "output": "Each mind will go only as far as it is ready to at any point in time in accepting the truth about itself. The various symbol systems of the world, whether we are speaking of physics or metaphysics or any other form of thinking, are in the end only neutral symbols. The mind can choose to use them to reinforce belief in either the guilt or the innocence of God's Son. Truth is not in any of the symbol systems themselves but only in the mind, awaiting its choice. The symbol systems can point towards the truth, but the mind has to be willing to look. And yet there may be differences in how explicit the various symbol systems are in directing attention to the truth beyond themselves. So it is not likely that the field of quantum physics, while concluding that the world is an illusion, will ever come to a recognition that the \"energy\" on which the illusion of the world rests is guilt, which in itself is also illusory (T-18.IX.4-5; T- 19.II.6:1-5). And yet one can read A Course in Miracles and not accept its message of healing and wholeness. And one can read a text on quantum physics, or a Hindu text, or the Bible, or a telephone book, and come to the realization that all is one and that sin and separation are not real. So whether various paths will converge on the level of form in the end becomes irrelevant (M- 1.3:1-6). If we believe that we have found a path that will lead us home--and we want to go home--it would behoove us to follow its directions. And if that path is the Course, all we need to do, with the help of Jesus or the Holy Spirit, is forgive ourselves and all our projections."

    "text_input": "Q #750: In Lesson 73, \"I will there be light,\" the shorter practice periods say to repeat \"I will there be light. Darkness is not my will\" several times an hour. Then it says, \"It is most important, however, to apply today's idea in this form immediately you are tempted to hold a grievance of any kind\" (W-pI.73.11:3-6). That sounds to me as if Jesus is telling me to pray the anger down. Could you please explain?",
    "output": "It could be taken to mean that, and there are many other instructions along those lines. But if you take into consideration the teaching that precedes this specific instruction, you probably would not be inclined to use his instruction to \"pray the anger down.\" Notice also that in concluding, he says: \"This will help you let your grievances go, instead of cherishing them and hiding them in darkness.\" This means that in our practice we would become aware that we had been cherishing grievances and hiding them, and that we no longer want that. This is typical of Jesus' teaching method: he contrasts what we think we want with what we truly want. So in repeating, \"I will there be light. Darkness is not my will,\" we are really saying, \"I have been choosing darkness in holding onto grievances. That was a mistake, and now I choose light instead. I no longer cherish grievances.\" This parallels the theme of bringing the darkness to the light that runs throughout A Course in Miracles. We first acknowledge the darkness of the ego thought system that we had chosen, and then we bring that to the light, where it disappears."

    "text_input": "Q #751: Does self-esteem have anything to do with spiritual enlightenment? In other words, does high self-esteem reflect more spiritual advancement than low self-esteem? And, does one need a \"healthy ego\" before one can advance spiritually?",
    "output": "No matter how we slice it, the ego is healthy on its own terms. It uses high and low self esteem for its purpose of making the body and the world real, thus keeping us grounded in the dream of separation. The forgiveness path that A Course in Miracles teaches does not require that our self esteem be high or low. When the Course tells us we are not bodies (see W-pI.91.5), it refers as much to the psychological and emotional body as the physical body. As we are told early in the text: \"'Self-esteem' in ego terms means nothing more than that the ego has deluded itself into accepting its reality...\" (T-4.II.6:8). We are asked to see whatever inflated or deflated perceptions we have about ourselves as the reflection of our choice to identify with the body and make it real. In this sense, high and low are the same: there is no hierarchy of illusions (T- 20.VIII.8). All are opportunities to forgive ourselves for who we think we are when we deny who we truly are. Jesus tells us that in our chosen identities as bodies we have decided to esteem ourselves in the lowest possible form: \"You think you are the home of evil, darkness and sin. You think if anyone could see the truth about you he would be repelled, recoiling from you as if from a poisonous snake. You think if what is true about you were revealed to you, you would be struck with horror so intense that you would rush to death by your own hand, living on after seeing this being impossible\" (W- pI.93.1:1-3). The goal of the Course is to teach us that we have been mistaken and are not the despicable creatures we think we are. The fact that Jesus has us repeat \"I am as God created me\" more often than any other phrase in the Course indicates our great need to hear it. He knows we don't believe it. We are much more devoted to our identity as creatures of the ego, which is why we need a Teacher Who leads us to our highest Self-esteem by teaching us to exchange our miserable selves for our true identity. That is not to say that we should not \"give the devil his due\" by taking steps to enhance a low self-image. This is not a Course in behavior. In fact, coming to terms with deep feelings of worthlessness may be the just the ticket to seeking \"another way\" such as the Course teaches. Thus, low self-esteem can open the door to the healing Jesus offers in the Course, while high self-esteem may delude a person into believing all is well or lead him to seek beyond the ego when its fulfillment proves shallow. Low or high, well adjusted or maladaptive, all may serve the Holy Spirit's purpose; we cannot judge by form. As the manual tells us: \"The curriculum is highly individualized, and all aspects are under the Holy Spirit's particular care and guidance\" (M-29.2:6).\tMoreover, high self-esteem may be nothing more than the grandiosity the text tells us \" ... is always a cover for despair. It is an attempt to counteract your littleness, based on the belief that the littleness is real\" (T- 9.VIII.2:1,3). The important thing is to bring every concept of the self to the light of forgiveness. Each must be raised to doubt that we may eventually learn we do not know who we are: \" ... the reason for the course is that you do not know what you are\" (T-9.I.2:5). As we look at the many lofty and lowly ideas we have about ourselves, it is helpful to keep in mind these words and ask the Holy Spirit to replace our false self-concept with the truth He brings: \"I do not know the thing I am, and therefore do not know what I am doing, where I am, or how to look upon the world or on myself\" (T-31.V.17:7). Q: #752: T-1.IV.4:6-8 says, \"I assure you that I will witness for anyone who lets me, and to whatever extent he permits it. Your witnessing demonstrates your belief, and thus strengthens it. Those who witness for me are expressing, through their miracles, that they have abandoned the belief in deprivation in favor of the abundance they have learned belongs to them.\" Having grown up in the Baptist Church, we were taught that to \"witness for Jesus\" meant telling everyone about him and about our belief in him. What does Jesus mean with these statements in A Course in Miracles? A: In the Course, to witness has the same meaning as to teach. It means to attest to the thought system we have chosen in our minds (the ego or the Holy Spirit). It does not refer to any specific words or behavior that are the domain of the body, for as we are told in the text: \"The body is a limit imposed on the universal communication that is an eternal property of mind\" (T-18.VI.8:3). Therefore, it is the state of mind that follows the choice to believe the Holy Spirit, rather than the ego, that witnesses to Him, to Jesus, and to the part of the mind that reflects the true Self. Jesus, who is a symbol of the part of our mind that remembers our identity as God's innocent Son, witnesses/teaches only our truth because he sees nothing else. He does so to whatever extent we are willing, as the first sentence in the passage you quote states. His witness is accepted by a choice in the mind not to believe the ego. Practicing forgiveness by recognizing thoughts of judgment and attack, seeing in them the projection of our own guilt for choosing separation, is how we teach/witness to Jesus. It strengthens belief in the Holy Spirit in ourselves and in the whole Sonship. Likewise, our attack thoughts teach/witness to our belief in the separation, and strengthen identity with the ego. We are always choosing the ego or the Holy Spirit, and are therefore always witnessing to one or the other. That is what is meant when Jesus tells us in the text: \"Everyone teaches [witnesses], and teaches [witnesses] all the time. This is a responsibility you inevitably assume the moment you accept any premise at all, and no one can organize his life without some thought system. Once you have developed a thought system of any kind, you live by it and teach it\" (T-6.in.2:2-4). Unlike the directives of the Baptist Church and many other Christian Churches, Jesus does not tell us to speak about the Course. We are asked only to study, practice, and apply its teaching. Its application in our own lives witnesses to it, whether anyone else is consciously aware of it or not. Although we may in fact discuss the teachings of the Course with others, we do so to further our own understanding, not to convince anyone else that they should study or practice the Course. Traditional Christian proselytizing usually includes pointing out to the sinner his/her sinful ways with a call to convert to appropriate behavior. The Course teaches a very different view: \"Any attempt you make to correct a brother means that you believe correction by you is possible, and this can only be the arrogance of the ego\" (T-9.III.7:8). We are thus relieved of any need to say or do anything on the level of behavior with respect to Jesus' message in the Course. Our goal is to allow our minds to be healed of the thought of separation through the practice of forgiveness. Belief shifts gradually from the ego to the Holy Spirit, and then because \"The power of witness comes from your belief\" (T-27.II.5:4), we bear witness to His peace and love with no effort on our part."

    "text_input": "Q #753: This is more of a \"grammatical\" question, I first read this passage in the German translation of A Course in Miracles and thought perhaps it is a translation mistake, but I checked with the original English version and the passage is equally confusing. Lesson 1 of the workbook says: \"That is the purpose of the exercise. The statement should merely be applied to anything you see. As you practice the idea for the day, use it totally indiscriminately. Do not attempt to apply it to everything you see, for these exercises should not become ritualistic\" (W-pI.1.3:2-5). Can you explain the difference between applying things to anything you see but not to everything? In German it is clearly the same ... what do I \"have\" to do, I look at things and say they are nothing but should not look at everything I see and say the same? Is this some kind of  \"loose\" viewpoint, nothing matters anything but please do not apply this idea as a doctrine (because then it would matter)?",
    "output": "Sentence 6 holds the key to what Jesus is getting at: \"Only be sure that nothing you see is specifically excluded.\" He is very much aware of the cleverness of our egos--how we all would attempt to compromise and make bargains with him so that we don't have to change too much-- how we try to get him to accept our terms and conditions for our relationship with him as our teacher. Thus, in the context of this lesson, he is alerting us to this tendency to put ourselves in control of our work with his course. He knows that we would attempt to exclude certain parts of our experience from the application, and so he is saying, \"Don't do this. It will not help you to achieve the goals of this course if you make exceptions to my instructions.\" This is what he means in the statements he makes about achieving the holy instant: \"The necessary condition for the holy instant does not require that you have no thoughts that are not pure. But it does require that you have none that you would keep ... In your practice, then, try only to be vigilant against deception, and seek not to protect the thoughts you would keep to yourself\" (T-15.IV.9:1-2,8). While Jesus wants us to be disciplined in our practice--because our minds are typically so un- disciplined--he wants us to stop short of ritual, only because turning a practice into a ritual usually means we no longer do it in a meaningful way that would produce the desired effects. He tells us in the manual for teachers: \"Routines as such are dangerous, because they easily become gods in their own right, threatening the very goals for which they were set up\" (M-16.2:5). Our willingness to do what he advises, even if we forget to do it, is what affects our spiritual process, as opposed to the mere repetition of what he tells us to say at exactly the times he tells us to say it."

    "text_input": "Q #754: My question is if we made up this world and God doesn't know about it why are we asking for His guidance?",
    "output": "We seek guidance because we have forgotten Who we are, and we need help to remember. In the clarification of terms we are told: \"There is no need for help to enter Heaven for you have never left. But there is need for help beyond yourself as you are circumscribed by false beliefs of your Identity\" (C-5.1:1-2). The help does not come from God for, as you mention, God does not know about us as bodies and therefore does not hear prayers nor give us guidance: \"God does not guide, because He can share only perfect knowledge\" (T-5.II.5:1); \"God does not help because He knows no need\" (C-5.1:7). The ego, on the other hand, has us believe that the world is real, which entails the belief that God made it and the body, and is therefore in communication with it. This cannot be, for God, Who is real, cannot know a body that does not exist: \"At no single instant does the body exist at all\" (T-18.VII.3:1). However, we who are deeply attached to our belief in the body find it difficult to understand that God does not know bodies, and does not hear our prayers. In fact, we cannot help but identify God with the body. As Jesus tells us in the text: \"Everything you recognize you identify with externals, something outside itself. You cannot even think of God without a body, or in some form you think you recognize\" (T-18.VIII.1:6-7). Therefore, he uses language, terms, and images that are familiar to us to gently teach us that we are minds, not bodies. Thus, the form takes into consideration our fear and our mistaken beliefs, while the content gradually leads us beyond our fear. Having dissociated from our identity as minds, we have become oblivious to the mind's power and fearful of it. That is why, for example, the beautiful prayers in the second half of the workbook are addressed to God, even though we are told He does not understand words (M- 21.1:7). We are actually addressing the part of our minds that holds the memory of God. The inspiring words reflect the principles taught in A Course in Miracles, and praying them helps us join with the part of our minds that believes them. This same process holds true for all the ways we seek guidance. While we are still afraid of our true Identity, we need a symbol that we perceive as \"outside\" of ourselves who represents our right mind. Consulting with someone whose wisdom and example we respect, praying words to God, or meditating, reflect the mind's choice to return to the Teacher/Holy Spirit within Who speaks to us from beyond the insanity of the ego. We may ask the wrong questions and even seek guidance for things pertaining to the ego that would hurt us if we achieved them, yet the simple acknowledgement that there is a Teacher other than the ego to Whom we can turn, strengthens our belief in Him. It is important, therefore, that we continue to ask for help for every need we think we have, until we learn that \"[we] ... need only truth. In that all needs are satisfied, all cravings end, all hopes are finally fulfilled and dreams are gone\" (W-pII.251.1:5-6)."

    "text_input": "Q #755: I have been studying A Course in Miracles for many years. From the first time I read it, I got interested in it and thought I understood it. However, I still read it, feeling as if I read it for the first time. I wonder if I am increasing my level of understanding.",
    "output": "The study of A Course in Miracles is a process that usually requires several readings and rereading because its teachings reverse everything we believe about everything: \"To learn this course requires willingness to question every value that you hold\" (T-24.in.2:1; italics ours). This is not an easy task because the choice to identify with the body has led to a multitude of seemingly diverse values and beliefs. The fear of letting go of this identity with the body keeps the belief system that supports it in place. Frequently questioning our beliefs begins with those experienced as painful, since it is relatively easy to let go of unwanted beliefs. With time we discover that everything we believe about ourselves as bodies causes us pain in some way, and that nothing we do to alleviate the pain really works. That is usually when we begin our study all over again, seemingly for the first time. It takes years of study and practice to train our minds to recognize our hidden thoughts, beliefs and values. The more we practice, the more understanding we bring to our reading of the Course, which often means realizing we did not previously understand, or do not now understand. Your experience is shared by many, if not all, students of the Course, and it is an important part of the process. Accepting the fact that we do not know or understand is the beginning of wisdom, as this striking passage in the text tells us: \"When every concept has been raised to doubt and question, and been recognized as made on no assumptions that would stand the light, then is the truth left free to enter in its sanctuary, clean and free of guilt. There is no statement that the world is more afraid to hear than this: I do not know the thing I am, and therefore do not know what I am doing, where I am, or how to look upon the world or on myself. Yet in this learning is salvation born\" (T-31.V.17:5-8). This is a good example of how the Course reverses our thinking. Progress in \"understanding\" is evidenced by awareness of our lack of understanding. In an earlier passage Jesus makes the same point: \"You are still convinced that your understanding is a powerful contribution to the truth, and makes it what it is. Yet we have emphasized that you need understand nothing\" (T- 18.IV.7:5-6). In view of our difficulty in understanding the Course, this is a great relief; to the ego, it is insulting. The ego is convinced of its own brilliance, never suspecting it \" ... cannot know anything\" (T-6.IV.3:1). Though our understanding is not required, our willingness is. Only this enables us to practice the forgiveness Jesus teaches in the Course. Practicing forgiveness leads to healing our minds of the thought of separation, and it is this we seek more than understanding."

I've been going through difficult times in the outer material (non-existing) world, while the inner, peaceful world manifests itself. What could I do to find the peace of God and still act in this world? How can we see this world with the eyes of the Holy Spirit, and avoid dealing with such a vicious ego and its attacks? In my case these attacks come in the form of economic difficulties that I've never gone through before.",
    "output": "Most of us, when we first come to the Course, do not understand what we are opening the door to--the locked vaults of sin and guilt in our own mind (T-31.V.6:6)! We think we are simply asking to have a more peaceful and loving experience in the world by getting in touch with the Teacher of Love and peace within. At one level, that is true, but the process in coming to that experience of peace involves forgiveness, which none of us really understands in the beginning (S-2.I.1). For we think we are going to learn how to forgive all the bastards in our life, not realizing that there is really only one bastard to forgive--ourselves! The reason we are ever not at peace has nothing to do with our external life circumstances but only with the choice we have made to identify with the ego and its thought system of sin and guilt and fear and scarcity within. But for most of us, it is too fearful to look directly within and so the Course's process is an indirect one (T-14.I.4-5)--we look at the projections of the ego from our mind out onto the screen we call the world, which seems to be outside us. As real as the external problems outside us may seem, the Course is leading us to a recognition that the problem is only our interpretation of those situations (M-17.4:2), which is coming from our belief in our own sin and guilt, for which we believe we deserve punishment. And so the lessons begin--not orchestrated by the Holy Spirit but brought by our own mind into our awareness so that the spots of guilt within can now be healed, rather than continuing to fester, hidden and unrecognized in the dark recesses of our own mind. The goal is not to avoid the ego and its attacks but rather to learn to welcome the opportunity for healing that each challenging situation offers us. And so a relationship may suddenly seem to become more difficult, or some shift in our life circumstances--health, financial, career, etc.--may seem to arise. Now, an initial interpretation of such challenges is that the ego is trying to sabotage us in our efforts to make a different choice, and certainly these problems can have the initial effect of riveting our attention even more in the world. But with the Holy Spirit as our Teacher we can begin to recognize that these are just the opportunities to practice forgiveness of ourselves that we have at some level invited in. In your own case, the new economic problems can be seen as opportunities to uncover your beliefs about yourself in terms of scarcity, lack and unworthiness. And as you can come to share the Holy Spirit's perception of yourself, you will begin to open up to a different interpretation of those financial challenges. As your own guilt is released, the external circumstances will merely be situations to be addressed, but not indictments of yourself. And so whether the external situation shifts or not will be irrelevant to your own peace of mind. Now this is the process, described very briefly, and you may find your resistance to accepting the Holy Spirit's interpretation strong, especially at the beginning. But that is why Jesus presents forgiveness in the Course as a process, requiring practice over time. Further discussion of how to look at issues related to money and financial challenges from the Course's perspective can be found in Questions #113, #139, #349, and #487."

    "text_input": "Q #757: Is the \"inner child\" an aspect of the ego's composition? Is healing the inner child actually helpful or just more of the ego's smokescreen?",
    "output": "The inner child, as typically spoken of and worked with in some therapeutic contexts, would be an aspect of the ego from the perspective of A Course in Miracles. As with everything, its helpfulness as a concept depends on how it is used. It may be used, and typically is, to reinforce the perception that one has been victimized as a child. Now it is true that most of us in various ways feel we were treated unfairly, perhaps even abused, when we were younger and more helpless, and may also feel we carry the scars of those past experiences into our present lives, preventing us from feeling worthy of love and achieving our full potential now. And the Course would not want us to deny that these are our experiences and perceptions. Therapeutic interventions based on the concept of the inner child may then encourage the individual to nurture his or her inner child, providing oneself the adult support and love that was not provided by the adult figures, typically the parents, during childhood. In that way, one can now take responsibility for one's life and not feel condemned to continue playing out the victim scripts in the present. And certainly, from the perspective of functioning in the world, this can all be very helpful. However, if we go no further than this with the idea, from the Course's perspective we would merely be serving the ego's purpose of keeping the roles of victim and victimizer real and never getting to the real source of the pain and feelings of unworthiness in the mind (T-27.VII.1-9). On the other hand, using the concept of the inner child to identify the victim dynamic within oneself can be a very helpful first step in uncovering the ego's defenses, especially for anyone who may have a tendency to deny difficult feelings and sugarcoat the past, out of guilt and fear over confronting very negative repressed feelings towards family and others. For any genuine healing, as the Course speaks of it, to occur, we need to be able to acknowledge the many ways in which we feel we have been and are being victimized, for only then can we begin to identify the strong attraction we in fact have to such feelings, for they are the great preservers of guilt, seen in someone other than ourselves. And this projection is always the ego's intent in every relationship (T-19.IV-A.10-13). And so, if we see getting in touch with our victimized inner child as a necessary first step in the forgiveness process, but only a first step--since in the end it is only ourselves we need to forgive for wanting to believe we can be deprived of love by anything other than our own choice (T- 4.IV.3:3)--the concept can be of great value. For then it will be possible to get in touch with our real inner Child (W-pI.182)!"

    "text_input": "Q #758: I am working as a secretary and organizing and \"planning ahead\" is an important part of my job. A Course in Miracles states that we should not \"plan the future.\" How can I follow the Course without having to, drastically speaking, quit my job?",
    "output": "The essence of this teaching is that we should not make plans on our own, which almost always means with the ego. Similarly, when Jesus says in the text, \"I need do nothing\" (T- 18.VII), he means that before we act or make plans, we should bring our perceptions to his or the Holy Spirit's loving presence in our minds, so that we would be able to purify them of the ego's purpose. This is evident from the statement that follows Jesus' saying that \"a healed mind does not plan\" (W-pI.135.11:1). Note that he is talking about a healed mind, which simply \"carries out the plans that it receives through listening to wisdom that is not its own ... It does not depend upon itself for anything except its adequacy to fulfill the plans assigned to it\" (W-pI.135.11:2,4). This is the ideal we are growing toward. Thus, Jesus is really not saying that we should not makes plans. No one could function with making plans of some kind. The point is that our plans are normally based on unquestioned assumptions about who we are and what we ought to be doing with our lives; we rarely question our definitions of our problems and their solutions. And those assumptions are almost always part of the ego's strategy to keep us mindlessly bound to its plan to maintain the separation from God. This is what Jesus is getting at. He is helping us release our perceptions from the bondage of the ego, thus freeing ourselves to switch to the Holy Spirit's purpose for our lives. We might wind up making the exact same plans as before, but the purpose would have been changed and we would not take what we are doing quite so seriously. This has been of concern to many students; see also Questions #90, #289, #293, and #305."

I have a hard time releasing myself from the thought system of the world and accepting that it is an illusion. It seems that ever since I've started studying the ideas in the Course, I've had nightmares, but at the same time it feels so right to me. I know these things written in the Course are true, but I don't know how to rid myself of my old way of thinking, so that I can see the truth. I have been diagnosed with schizophrenia, which has relevance since I've accepted some crazy thought systems in the past which have proven themselves to be wrong. Basically, I'm afraid to throw myself into something again, being that I've been so wrong in the past. Please try to look at this from my point of view, for the things that are problems to me, are truly real problems to me in my mind. Please try to understand what it would be like not to be able to control your thoughts and emotions, and at the same time, to yearn for truth and God's Love.",
    "output": "Perhaps you will find it reassuring to know that, despite the problems you've encountered in your life and the world's diagnosis for those problems, the Course would say that, at a deeper level--the only level that really counts--you are not any different from anyone else. We all share the same ego mental illness, or illness of the mind, believing things that aren't real (T- 13.V.6:1-2) and mounting defenses against the truth that are completely dysfunctional. For, as Jesus says, \"all illness is mental illness\" (P-2.IV.1:1)--we all simply express our illness in different ways. That is not to minimize the particular set of challenges you personally have been confronting and the special concerns they raise for you as to whether you can trust your judgment about the validity and value of the Course's teachings for you. And yet again you are not alone in raising these questions. If you can set aside for a moment any consideration of the Course's metaphysical premise that the world is an illusion and simply focus on the one problem that we seem to share universally, that we are often immobilized by guilt and fear--and it is with that problem we all seek help--you may be willing to accept the Course's antidote to that guilt and fear--forgiveness. Forgiveness means nothing more than being willing to accept that your judgments about the world and others may simply be wrong. You do not have to begin by denying the reality of the world. You only need to be willing to deny the validity of your interpretations of the world. Considering your experiences so far in your life, you may not find this a difficult premise to accept. And this step will help you begin to release yourself from the fear and the guilt in your mind that leads you to question both yourself and the Course's value for you. As you can step back from the fear and the guilt, you may then begin to get greater clarity as to whether the Course is the appropriate path for you. Whether the Course ends up being your path is not something you need to know at the outset, nor is it necessary for you to know that in order to benefit from its gentle teachings on forgiveness. Among the many implications of its teachings is that it is not necessary for you, as you say, \"to rid myself of my old way of thinking, so that I can see the truth.\" By simply looking honestly at your old way of thinking without shrinking back from it, but acknowledging the painful limitations and consequences of judgment, you will begin to value it less and less as a mental tool. No active resistance or struggle against the old way is necessary. In fact, the resistance simply gives the old way of thinking power, for it says it is real and must be overcome. But a gentle looking allows it simply to dissolve into nothingness, which is all it really is. You do not say whether you are currently getting treatment or taking any medications for your condition, but there would be nothing in the Course that would counsel against seeking help from outside yourself. Recognizing and acknowledging our limitations and then seeking help at the level and in the form in which we are able to accept it is very consonant with the Course's teachings (T-2.IV.4-5)."

    "text_input": "Q #760: In speaking with a rabbi's wife, I mentioned forgiveness. She immediately reacted and asked if I meant \"the golden rule,\" or what the Buddha once taught.\" She did not care to talk anymore. I later wondered whether the term compassion would be easier to mention.",
    "output": "Forgiveness, as Jesus teaches it in A Course in Miracles, involves a recognition that perceiving oneself as \"sinned against\" or victimized is the projection of guilt that is the result of the mind's choice to be separate from God and to identify with the body. This teaching is unique to the Course, which tells us \"There is no sin\" (T-26.VII.10:5). However, what is usually understood as forgiveness, particularly in the Judaeo-Christian tradition, rests on the belief that sin is real and must be atoned for to be forgiven. It is almost impossible to speak of forgiveness without evoking thoughts of sin. It generally means that someone who has inflicted harm must be released of blame, and a \"legitimate claim\" to retribution must be relinquished by the \"victim.\" This can be threatening no matter what beliefs one has about it, as your experience demonstrates. And so the question becomes whether to talk about forgiveness at all. As Jesus tells us so often in the Course, it is the content of our minds that \"teaches\" both forgiveness and the compassion that flows from it. The words we use \"are but symbols of symbols\" (M-21.1:9), and are therefore irrelevant. It is helpful to remember that our only purpose is the healing of our minds: \"Let yourself [mind] be healed that you may be forgiving, offering salvation to your brother and yourself ... What you would prove to him you will believe. The power of witness comes from your belief. And everything you say or do or think but testifies to what you teach to him ... It is this testimony that can speak with power greater than a thousand tongues. For here is his forgiveness proved to him\" (T-27.II.4:7; 5:3-5,8-9). In all of our encounters, therefore, the only thing we are asked to do is practice the forgiveness we are taught, which means being willing to monitor our minds for any thoughts of judgment, and then give them to the Holy Spirit to be transformed. Only then will our words reflect His message that the other person's fear or defensiveness has had no effect and there is nothing to forgive. Thus we \" ... forgive the Son of God for what he did not do\" (T-17.III.1:5). This is the most compassionate thing we can do for ourselves and for others. It is also the only way we are asked to express forgiveness. We are thus relieved of the burden of searching for words to reflect the love that is in our minds when we join with the Holy Spirit. As Jesus tells us in the text: \" ... love is content, and not form of any kind\" (T-16.V.12:1). Thus, if while speaking with someone about any subject, including forgiveness, a choice to identify with the Holy Spirit has been made, whatever words are used will reflect the love that He represents. Our goal in learning this course is to forgive ourselves for all our judgments and listen to the Holy Spirit in our minds, Whose words will replace ours: \"The Holy Spirit speaks to you. He does not speak to someone else. Yet by your listening His Voice extends, because you have accepted what He says\" (T-27.V.1:10-12)."

Even if we recognize this fact, I don't feel that this makes any difference in our normal lives. The world does not cease to exist, even if we try.",
    "output": "From the perspective of absolute truth, you are right, there can be no Son distinguishable from God (W-pI.132.12:4). It is only within the seeming dream of the sleeping Son that there appear to be two entities, God and the Son. And, unlike some Eastern spiritual teachings, the God of the Course does not dream and the world is not the effect of His dreaming but of the Son's. The Course speaks of the Son because it is addressed to a mind caught in the misbelief of duality and separation, and so uses the split mind's symbols to correct the misbelief, while we still believe we are separate (T-25.I.7:4). See also Questions #27, #72, #85 and #228 for further discussions of how A Course in Miracles comes to us in dualistic language, despite its nondualistic metaphysics. There is no link between God and the world, for the world is only a shadowy projection of an illusory thought of guilt in the mind. There is however a Link between God and the mind of the Son that seems to have fallen asleep, which the Course calls the Holy Spirit (T-6.I.19:1; T- 10.III.2:5-6; T-13.XI.8:1; C-6.3-4). This link is not a separate entity--although the Course often speaks of the Holy Spirit in this way--but is only the memory of God (T-10.II.2:3-6) that we would have had to carry with us in our mind into the dream, since we can never separate from God in reality. Nothing within the realm of duality and separate beings, including angels, has any real existence from the Course's perspective. The Course does use the concept of angels in a number of places, but only as a symbol of God's Love (see also Questions #36 and #413ii). That realm of duality also includes the selves we think we are. The \"I\" is the false self of the ego, the illusory individual self we all cling to as our identity. The Course's goal, through the process of forgiveness, or letting go of our judgments, is to lead us to a readiness to release all the concepts we hold about ourselves, including, at the very end of the process, the concept that we are an individual self, an \"I\"--ego is, after all, the Latin word for \"I.\" Although the Course's metaphysics teaches that time is already over, Jesus acknowledges that, as you point out, this is not our experience: \"For those in time can speak of things beyond, and listen to words which explain what is to come is past already. Yet what meaning can the words convey to those who count the hours still, and rise and work and go to sleep by them?\" (W-pI.169.10:3-4). And yet, in practical terms, as we can allow ourselves to accept the possibility of the idea, even if it is not our immediate experience, it may perhaps help us over time begin to take the specifics of our lives and ourselves just a little less seriously, to have a little less concern about how things turn out, and to be more open merely to watching ourselves move through our lives without trying so obstinately to control the outcomes. All of these would be reflections of a deepening peace that flows from the acceptance of all that is, which forgiveness brings about. And what could be more practical?"

But I feel guilty that I was told this information about them. I feel like it is an intrusion on their privacy.",
    "output": "Without knowing more about you and the situation, it is difficult to respond. Knowing someone's background does not necessarily have to result in guilt, so there must be an issue related to how you got the information and/or what you are doing with it in your mind. The guilt could also be related just to your having judged that person in the first place--guilt always results from seeing another person's interests as separate from your own. The need to find fault with others, as distinguished from an objective observation about behavior, comes from the underlying need to project our guilt over having rejected the call to set aside our ego and join with the love of Jesus instead. Because of this we would always feel guilty about condemning others, as part of us knows that we are using that judgment to get ourselves off the hook. This is the ego's principle of one or the other: if you are guilty, I am innocent. Forgiveness, on the other hand, is grounded in the perception of shared interests and shared identity: we all share the same mind--the same ego and the same Holy Spirit, along with the ability to choose between the two. Your guilt will vanish, thus, when you choose against separate interests and instead share perception with the Holy Spirit."

    "text_input": "Q #763: The following two questions address related issues about the Holy Spirit and the ego and so are being answered together:  (i): A Course in Miracles states that, since the ego and the Holy Spirit are irreconcilable orders of reality, it is impossible for each to know of the other's existence. Ken often refers to the fact that the ego is only aware that there exists a power greater than itself: that of the \"decision maker\" to make another choice. That implies, however, that the ego is at least aware that there is an alternative to its thought system. Furthermore, in recounting the myth of the birth of the ego, Ken often states that the ego implores the Son not to listen to the Voice of the Holy Spirit; that He is an \"avenging angel\" sent by God (another entity of which the ego cannot possibly be aware) to destroy us. Could you please clarify the nature of the \"awareness\" of the ego vis-a-vis the Holy Spirit and vice versa.  (ii): The American healer Chris Griscom describes the Higher Self in her books as \"the megaphone of the Soul\", a kind of communicator between the \"ego\" and the soul. I wonder, can the Holy Spirit that the Course talks of be equated to the Higher Self as it \"bridges the gap\" between God and the ego-world?",
    "output": "To begin with, a point of clarification. It is not simply that the ego and the Holy Spirit are \"two irreconcilable orders of reality.\" From the Course's perspective, the Holy Spirit represents the only order of reality, while the ego is a symbol for unreality. They are mutually exclusive thoughts and only one--the Holy Spirit--is true (T-14.IX.2). Now our choice to believe in the ego makes the ego true for us, and so the Course often speaks to us as if the ego were real, but only to help us get in touch with what we believe, so that we can make a different choice about that belief (T-4.VI.1; T-7.VIII.4:5-7). Inherent in the ego thought is the idea of something other than itself. For the ego, as the thought of separation, in order to exist, must exist apart from something else--that is where it came from (W-pII.223.1). And so its very identity presumes there must be something other than itself, from which it is separate. And so it must contain a recognition that there is \"an alternative to its thought system.\" While the ego's existence presumes there is something outside itself, it is impossible for the ego to contain any knowledge or understanding of what that alternative is, since the ego's existence depends on the denial of the alternative (T-4.III.4:1-4; T-9.I.10:2-3,5; T-11.V.16:6-9). And so implicit in the ego's illusory existence is the thought that it exists at the other's expense. The alternative then can only be identified with danger and rejection and retaliation, but nothing of its true nature can be known from an ego perspective (T-4.II.8:1-8). And so while the ego defenses include fabrications about the nature of God and the Holy Spirit as cruel, vengeance-seeking dictators, nothing can be known of Their true reality as all-encompassing Love and Its reflection. Because the ego represents an alternative \"reality,\" implicit in its supposed existence is the notion that its existence is inextricably dependent on an exercise of choice between the alternatives (T-14.III.4; T-17.III.9). And since choice lies at the foundation of the ego's fragile existence, the only real ego fear can be that the power of choice that has brought about its seeming existence can also be used to choose against its existence. That is the only genuine \"threat\" that can be recognized from an ego perspective. The Holy Spirit, in contrast, is the thought of correction to the ego, which simply states that there can be nothing other than God, no alternative to God (T-24.in.2:8), that the separation never happened (T-6.II.10:7-8). The Holy Spirit, as the symbol of God's perfect Oneness, does come within an ego framework, using the symbols of the ego framework, but only to teach that the ego is not real. The Holy Spirit can be said to be aware of the ego only in the sense that He is the correction for it, but that correction does not presume that the ego has any reality. The correction is simply that the ego is not real (T-9.IV.5; T-9.V.2:1). While choice between alternatives (only one of which is real) seems to be real in our split mind, we can say that the Holy Spirit is the choice for the only Alternative. Now having said all this, it is also apparent from the Course's discussion of the Holy Spirit that we will experience the Holy Spirit as having many specific functions, such as Comforter (e.g., T- 11.III.1:1-2; 7:1-2), Guide (e.g., T-14.III.14), Mediator (e.g, T-5.III.7), and Teacher (e.g., T- 12.V.5,9). These are all metaphoric descriptions that reflect how we will translate this abstract symbol of perfect love into specific forms that we can identify with and be reassured by, while we still believe we are separate. But it is important to recognize that, from within the Course's metaphysical framework, the Holy Spirit is not the Bridge between God and the ego world, but rather the Bridge between the split mind and the one Mind, from perception to knowledge (e.g., T-5.III.1; W-pI.96.8:3). Now we may experience the Holy Spirit as communicating specific thoughts and ideas to us, but these would only be our own transformation of the Holy Spirit's correction for the ego thought system into a form we are ready to accept in order to experience love. So, since these functions are only metaphoric in the Course, it would not be accurate to equate the Holy Spirit of the Course with the Higher Self of other spiritual teachings, which operate from the premise that the world is real."

    "text_input": "Q #764: Is God not in the trees we see, the sun, etc.? I'm having a hard time deciphering created forms with the spirit of God in them vs. ego-made things. Are our beloved animals, pets, creatures of God, or merely forms which the ego has made? I'm deeply committed to the goal of A Course in Miracles, yet when I see the beauty of the mountains and trees I'm having a difficult time understanding that this physical beauty is not a manifestation of spirit on this \"earth.\" Did God not say \"Let there be heaven and earth and the waters, etc.,\" which would mean to me that these are of creation, not ego made.",
    "output": "The Bible teaches that God made the world and everything in it, which is the meaning of the biblical passage you quote. A Course in Miracles not only does not teach that God made the world, it teaches that \"The world was made as an attack on God\" (W-pII.3.2:1; italics ours). In the text, Jesus makes an even more striking statement: \"You cannot behold the world and know God. Only one is true\" (T-8.VI.2:2-3). These statements, along with many other similar statements, are what distinguish the Course's teaching from traditional Christian theology and the Bible. In fact, they are mutually exclusive. Jesus leaves no room for doubt regarding the origin of the world and its seeming beauty: \"God made it [the world] not. Of this you can be sure\" (W-pI.152.6:2-3). The Course teaches that guilt for having chosen to believe separation from God is possible gave rise to the world. Its purpose is to hide from the imagined punishment of a God filled with wrath over the Son's choice. In other words, the world is a projection of guilt: \"The world you see is the delusional system of those made mad by guilt\" (T-13.in.2:2). When the dream of separation is taken seriously, the Son is left feeling homeless and seeks in the world a \"home away from Home.\" Just as our homes are filled with comforts, the ego uses the mind's ability to miscreate to infuse the world with enough beauty to make life in exile tolerable and at times even enjoyable. However, because the dream is one of separation from God, God cannot be part of it and is \"banished\" from awareness. Then, in order for this scheme of separation to work in the mind of the Son, responsibility for the choice to be separate must be denied/ forgotten. The best form of denial is projection. So the backwards ego version of the story goes: \"I did not choose to be here, God put me here. It is not my fault!\" This choice for separation that has occurred in the mind is \"acted out\" in the story of Adam and Eve, the \"highest\" of God's creatures, who turn from God by their disobedience. Now God, rather than the guilt-ridden Son, judges this as a grievous sin, and inflicts a severe punishment: suffering and death. Life in \"paradise,\" no matter how beautiful it may seem, is now overshadowed by the doom of death. \"Look carefully at this world, and you will realize that this is so. For this world is the symbol of punishment, and all the laws that seem to govern it are the laws of death. Children are born into it through pain and in pain. Their growth is attended by suffering, and they learn of sorrow and separation and death\" (T-13.in.2:2-6). Everyone here receives this death sentence. It is just punishment for the sin of disobedience: \"The wages of sin is death\" (Romans 6:23). Jesus tells us in the Course that the thought of separation is not a sin, it is actually impossible: \" ... the separation never occurred\" (T-6.II.10:7). The world and the entire experience of life in a body is an illusion. God, Who is real, does not know illusions. If He did, He would share in the Son's nightmare, and thus the nightmare would be true. Motivated by the deep loneliness and pain that accompanies belief in the separation, we seek comfort in beautiful things in the world. Although there is perhaps some temporary enjoyment in beholding them, neither the enjoyment nor the beauty lasts, which is why the greatest beauty of the world ultimately fails to satisfy the longing of our hearts for our true home. Nothing in this world fills the void left by the separation. In fact, all seeking ends in disappointment and pain: \"It is impossible to seek for pleasure through the body and not find pain. It is essential that this relationship be understood, for it is one the ego sees as proof of sin. It is not really punitive at all. It is but the inevitable result of equating yourself with the body, which is the invitation to pain\" (T-19.IV-B.12:1-4). Having employed the ego's skillful denial and avoidance tactics, our pain may not always be apparent, but a careful inventory of our deepest feelings reveals the hidden anguish of life apart from God. That is why we are told so often in the Course to pay attention to our feelings and to search our minds for thoughts of judgment. They are used to cover over the pain, and healing the thought of separation begins with realizing how painful it is. As the mind is healed, the peace that eventually replaces anguish is not contingent upon the beauty of a sunset, nor is it disturbed by ravishing storms. This peace is the goal of the forgiveness Jesus teaches in the Course. We forgive ourselves for believing we can find happiness outside of Heaven. However, since we believe the world and our bodies are real, we proceed gently through the process, enjoying the \"beauties of nature\" until we learn the real beauty of our truth. Art or beautiful things in nature can serve as reflections of the right mind when a choice is made to turn toward the Holy Spirit rather than the ego. The important thing is to enjoy them without confusing reality and illusion, by thinking we can bring God into the illusion: \"Seek not for [the completion of God and His Son] in the bleak world of illusion, where nothing is certain and where everything fails to satisfy\" (T-16.IV.9:4)."

    "text_input": "Q #765: I refer to #521. I accept that the Oneness of God, and the Oneness of the Sonship/Christ cannot be understood here. However, the Course does mention Sons, parts, beings, individuality, in context of the one Son, and in the context of creation (which can only occur in Heaven as I understand), and that the \"Sonship in its Oneness transcends the sum of its parts\" (T-2.VII.6:1-9, T-4.VII.5:1-7). Therefore, although we can't now understand how this all fits together, or understand if what we see now as individual minds equates to such parts or sons, the Course clearly identifies parts to the Sonship. Is not that your understanding?",
    "output": "Although, as you note, there are passages early in A Course in Miracles which seem to suggest that there are individual beings within Heaven, taken in the context of the teachings of the Course as a whole, this conclusion simply can not be supported. These passages are more readily explained as initial explanations about the nature of reality provided to Helen and Bill early in the scribing of the Course, when Jesus was attempting to describe that reality to them within a conceptual framework that they could more easily understand and relate to. But statements Jesus makes later in the Course make it clear that he could not have meant these early words literally. Two passages in the workbook make this especially clear: \"God shares His Fatherhood with you who are His Son, for He makes no distinctions in what is Himself and what is still Himself. What He creates is not apart from Him, and nowhere does the Father end, the Son begin as something separate from Him\" (W-pI.132.12:3-4; italics added). \"Oneness is simply the idea God is. And in His Being, He encompasses all things. No mind holds anything but Him. We say 'God is,' and then we cease to speak, for in that knowledge words are meaningless. There are no lips to speak them, and no part of mind sufficiently distinct to feel that it is now aware of something not itself. It has united with its Source. And like its Source Itself, it merely is\" (W-pI.169.5; italics added). Jesus' few references to consciousness also make it clear there can be no individuality in Heaven. For if even but two differentiable beings (e.g., Father and Son) exist, then consciousness must exist as well, for there to be any awareness of one other than oneself. Yet very early in the text, Jesus observes: \"Consciousness, the level of perception, was the first split introduced into the mind after the separation, making the mind a perceiver rather than a creator. Consciousness is correctly identified as the domain of the ego\" (T-3.IV.2:1-2). In other words, consciousness depends on separation, so that there can be a perceiver and a perceived. And the Course repeatedly describes perception as ego-based, while knowledge is possible only in Heaven (e.g., T-3.III, IV). Near the end of the Course, Jesus emphatically asserts: \"The structure of 'individual consciousness' is essentially irrelevant because it is a concept representing the 'original error' or the 'original sin'\" (C-in.1:4). So there is no consciousness in Heaven, and therefore there can be no experience of individuality. It can be very helpful to recognize that the desire to hang on to our individuality--which is what is really behind your question--is at the root of our resistance to practicing the Course's gentle principles of forgiveness. When we realize how strong our investment remains in maintaining a sense of individuality, which is the ego's compelling \"gift\" to us and nothing other than the desire for separation, we can at least begin to appreciate the power that we have given to our egos. And if we can be gentle with ourselves about our resistance, we will have taken a major step in forgiving ourselves for wanting this all to be real. For we cannot hold even one aspect of the ego thought system dear within our mind without making it all--the sin, the guilt, the pain, the fear, and death--real. You may wish to review #327 for a related discussion on individuality and oneness."

    "text_input": "Q #766: Lately I have been waking with thoughts, ideas or concepts from A Course in Miracles fresh in my awareness. For example: recently the thought has reoccurred that \"He knows what you have made and can transform this from a dream of hate to one of peace.\" It's not so much that I \"hear\" any kind of a voice but more that I have these thoughts with me as I wake up in the morning or during the night. It is probably impossible for you to determine what is going on here, but how do I know that this is not a trick of the ego or the intercession of Course principles in my right mind? There must be some level of the mind that the Course reaches/works with us on that does not require our conscious awareness or involvement, no? Could this be the \"little willingness\" that Jesus speaks of?",
    "output": "Although we are unable to comment on your individual experiences, we can say in general that it would not be unusual for ideas or passages from the Course to stay with people and just be there when they awake in the morning or at night. Other students have spoken of this and have also said that ideas sometimes just pop into their minds --a kind of \"hearing\"--while they are going about their daily activities, not even thinking of the Course. The processing of our study and practice is carried on largely, as you suggest, beneath the level of our conscious awareness; the contents of both the wrong and right minds are for the most part unconscious. Therefore, it would not be surprising that thoughts or words could seem to appear out of nowhere. Our \"little willingness\" to have Jesus be our teacher has mighty effects in our minds, of which we are mostly unaware. It may take many, many years of diligent practice before we are able to discern consistently what is coming from our ego and what is from the Holy Spirit or Jesus. If what you hear helps you become more kind, forgiving, and less guilty and judgmental, then just leave it at that. What is most important is not to make it into a big deal, which would happen if you felt a need to run to other people and tell them what happened. This need could well be manifesting the attraction to spiritual specialness. That, of course, is different from asking a question, such as you have done here. This Course is about your relationship with Jesus or the Holy Spirit, and bringing your ego to that light and love in your mind. That is where the focus of every student should be. Your trust in the process will develop gradually."

    "text_input": "Q #767: I want my cake and eat it too! Can I live in this world and still have the peace of God? Can I keep this creation as a form of amusement?",
    "output": "Sorry, no. And the reason is simple: this is what got us into trouble in the first place. Having our cake and eating too is another way of saying separation can work, that we can have Heaven and hell, specialness and peace, individuality and God, wholeness and a split mind. What's more, even a fleeting look at the world tells us that it is not very amusing. It was made as an attack on God (W-pII.3.2:1), and it shows: \"Anything in this world that you believe is good and valuable and worth striving for can hurt you, and will do so. Not because it has the power to hurt, but just because you have denied it is but an illusion, and made it real. And it is real to you. It is not nothing. And through its perceived reality has entered all the world of sick illusions\" (T-26.VI.1:1-5, italics ours). In a simple and clear statement in the text of A Course in Miracles, Jesus also tells us: \"It is impossible to seek for pleasure through the body and not find pain\" (T-19.IV-B.12:1). However, in accord with the insanity of the ego's thought system, we have taught ourselves that there are pleasurable things in the world that are preferable to Heaven. The universally acclaimed favorite is specialness, which, in spite of causing us great misery and tribulation, we find superior to the Identity God gave us as His One Son. We have taken great pains (literally) to contrive ingenious ways of convincing ourselves that there is happiness in the illusion. What we actually find in the \"beauty\" of some aspects of nature and some personal relationships is the satisfaction of having our needs and expectations met, and living \"proof\" that the world is real. However beautiful these things and relationships may seem to be, their purpose is a vicious attack on Gods Son, in that they have been chosen as a substitute for the Father's Love. By choosing to identify with the ego, and therefore with the body, we have turned away from His Love. This can only lead to deep pain, which is covered over by the endless pursuit of comfort and joy on the world's terms. It is endless because it does not satisfy the longing for our true Identity, which lies buried beneath the guilt for choosing the separation. So it is a bitter cake we bake when we seek for meaning in the meaninglessness of the illusion. We do have it, we are eating it, and it has made us sick. We have done this, just as children who overdose on sugar, because we are confused about our identity, and therefore confused about pain and joy: \"What is joyful to you is painful to the ego, and as long as you are in doubt about what you are, you will be confused about joy and pain\" (T-7.X.3:6). Our real \"cake\" is learning that we are minds, not bodies, that the world is not our home, and we will never be happy here. \"Eating\" it means accepting that we are God's innocent Son at home with Him. Since Jesus knows we are afraid of this truth, he offers us great comfort: \"Fear not that you will be abruptly lifted up and hurled into reality. Time is kind, and if you use it on behalf of reality, it will keep gentle pace with you in your transition\" (T-16.VI.8:1-2). Nothing in the process of learning is forced upon us, for no one truly learns under duress. Our healing, therefore, keeps pace with our fear. As fear decreases healing increases to whatever extent we are willing and never without our consent. The things we seek in the world, fear of losing them, and fear of accepting our truth all serve the same purpose of keeping us grounded in the belief that the separation is real. It is not a sin to eat and enjoy the ego's cake, but it will not bring us the happiness we seek. When tempted to indulge it may be helpful to remember that to turn to the Holy Spirit is an alternative that will not hurt: \"The Holy Spirit will direct you only so as to avoid pain. Surely no one would object to this goal if he recognized it\" (T-7.X.3:1-2). The peace Jesus promises is not found in the world. It is the true peace found in the forgiving mind, that is not contingent upon our cakes."

We are not able to communicate regarding our daughter and have been through domestic violence court, and through several hearings where my ex-husband continues to try increase his visitation to the point where she would eventually live with him. In studying A Course in Miracles, I have learned to pray for myself, to recognize that we are all children of God, that there is a divine spirit within all of us, and yet I am fearful for myself and my daughter and my ex because of his volatile anger. Is taking legal action against him the right thing to do?",
    "output": "The teachings of A Course in Miracles are focused on changing our minds, and therefore do not provide specific guidelines for behavior. Although Jesus invites us to leave behind the ego's perspective and allow it to be replaced by the Holy Spirit's, he does not tell us to deny our experience on the level of form. We therefore take care of our bodies in the normal way, keeping them healthy and safe. This often means taking steps to keep someone from hurting themselves and/or others, which can sometimes be accomplished through legal action. It is certainly possible to practice forgiveness as the Course teaches while initiating legal proceedings, if that is what you think you should do. Since the foundation of the world is the belief in the ego's thought system of attack and counter-attack, everything and everyone in it engage in destructive behavior to some degree. That is the inevitable expression of the separated Son's desperate call for help. What we are asked to do is look at any judgments we may have toward the person, seeing in them the projection of our own desperate call for help. Once we recognize how our fears are mirrored in the other person, we have the opportunity to forgive ourselves, asking the Holy Spirit to replace our judgments against ourselves and our brother with His. This process establishes that whatever we do or don't do with regard to another's behavior will be guided by the Holy Spirit rather than by the ego. Taking legal action is appropriate in certain circumstances; it does not mean, however, that the other party is a guilty sinner, worthy of God's punishment, as the ego would have us believe. The choice is not what course of action to pursue, but whose counsel we seek: the ego's or the Holy Spirit's. In this light we may paraphrase the oft-quoted line from the text: \"seek not to change your brother, but choose to change your mind about your brother\" (T- 21.in.1:7). Recognizing someone's volatile behavior as a call for help does not mean not paying attention to the form the call takes. This is true for everyone involved in your family's crisis. As Jesus tells us in the text: \" ... frightened people can be vicious\" (T-3.I.4:2). While steps are taken to protect yourself, your child, and your husband on the level of form, you may remember that these steps are the expression of your call to the Holy Spirit for help. It is important not to deny the fear that underlies the perceived need for protection, or any other need. What is not denied can be transformed by the Holy Spirit, so that whatever happens you will experience peace in your mind. It is to this peace, rather than any specific behavior, that the Holy Spirit guides us."

    "text_input": "Q #769: A Course in Miracles states that all creations of us are protected by God \"and kept for us\" until we return (where we never left; i.e., when we wake up). My question is in two parts. Has anyone ever returned after they did? If the ego is but a branch of our Soul-tree then is it not  protected as well, and all our attempts to counteract / undo it are all in vain? Should we pay attention to it, and thus give it \"energy\" and \"reality\"?",
    "output": "We do not have an answer to your first question, as there is no way of knowing this. Our creations are only in Heaven; they are the eternal extension of the Love shared by the Father and the Son, and are \"protected\" in the sense that they are eternal and can never be other than they are. This, of course, is not understandable to us in our separated state, as Jesus tells us in one place in the workbook: \"Creation cannot even be conceived of in the world. It has no meaning here\" (W-pI.192.3:1-2). In the manual for teachers, however, he refers to \"those who have reached God directly, retaining no trace of worldly limits and remembering their own Identity perfectly. These might be called the Teachers of teachers because, although they are no longer visible, their image can yet be called upon\" (M-26.2:1-2). Jesus also speaks of the \"real world,\" which is the state of mind reached by those with the clear awareness that the world and all bodily states are illusory. They no longer go back and forth between the ego thought system and the Holy Spirit's. These states, perhaps, are what you were referring to in your question. The Course does not speak of the ego as \"a branch of our Soul-tree\"; that is from a different spiritual system. The ego, in fact, is not even an entity. It is \"nothing more than a part of your belief about yourself ... the part of the mind that believes your existence is defined by separation\" (T-4.VI.1:6; T-4.VII.1:5). Therefore \"undoing the ego\" simply means changing your mind about the ego's reality; you accept the truth that the separation from God is not real; it is totally illusory. When you accept the truth about yourself without any reservations--namely, that \"I am as God created me\"-- then the ego just disappears: \"This terrible mistake about yourself the miracle corrects as gently as a loving mother sings her child to rest\" (C-2.8:2). A miracle in the Course is this shift in our perception of who we are; it is the light that dispels the darkness of the ego, as Jesus explains in the clarification of terms: \"Where there was darkness now we see the light. What is the ego? What the darkness was. Where is the ego? Where the darkness was. What is it now and where can it be found? Nothing and nowhere\" (C-2.6:1-7). Thus, we give reality to the ego only when we fear it, fight against it, or deny it. We need to pay attention to it only so that we can bring it out of the dark hiding place we provided for it and into the light of Jesus' love in our minds, where it simply is no more. That is why he emphasizes that the miracle \"looks on devastation, and reminds the mind that what it sees is false\" (W-pII.13.1:3); and in the text he also makes the point that the only way to get past the ego is to look at it with him: \"No one can escape from illusions unless he looks at them, for not looking is the way they are protected. There is no need to shrink from illusions, for they cannot be dangerous. We are ready to look more closely at the ego's thought system because together we have the lamp that will dispel it ... \" (T-11.V.1:1-3)."

But many people are working with A Course in Miracles for ten or more years, does it not have any effect? I also understand that \"once\" is completely and full-heartedly, at the guidance of the Holy Spirit. Perhaps that is the reason why doing it \"in parts\" does not have the desired effect of completeness?",
    "output": "The workbook, which is not the whole Course, is formatted as a year long practice period, but there are no other time frames or specific instructions in the Course for learning its curriculum: \"Only the time you take it is voluntary ... you can elect what you want to take at a given time\" (T-in.1:3,5). Although it is not necessary to practice the workbook more than once, the application of the fundamental principles of the Course found in its lessons are meant to be incorporated into a life long practice: \"As you perceive more and more common elements in all situations, the transfer of training under the Holy Spirit's guidance increases and becomes generalized. Gradually you learn to apply it to everyone and everything, for its applicability is universal\" (T-12.VI.6:5-6). This suggests a long term training process reaching beyond the workbook year. The goal of the workbook is, in fact, a \"timeless\" process: \"to train your mind in a systematic way to a different perception of everyone and everything in the world. The exercises are planned to help you generalize the lessons, so that you will understand that each of them is equally applicable to everyone and everything you see\" (W-in.4:1-2). The \"different perception\" means the reversal of the ego's thought system, which, even if one were very highly motivated, would take time. Remember Jesus' statement in the epilogue at the end of the workbook: \"This course is a beginning, not an end\" (W-ep.1:1). Everything we believe about the world and the body is false, because it is based on the belief that the separation is real. Given the high level of fear and resistance to accepting that this is true, we can expect many years of study and practice to undo this belief. It is unlikely that anyone would shift from identifying with the body to full awareness of the true Self in one lasting instant. In the Course, Jesus has given us a large volume of material to accommodate the volume of our fear and resistance. This enables us to proceed gently, over a period of time, questioning every belief we hold about everything, including, and especially, ourselves. We have so convinced ourselves that what we see, feel, and experience is real, that it is difficult to accept that we are wrong: \"It is difficult for the untrained mind to believe that what it seems to picture is not there. This idea can be quite disturbing, and may meet with active resistance in any number of forms\" (W-pI.9.2:1-2). All these forms of resistance can gradually be unraveled by careful, consistent study of the many different ways Jesus presents the simple message at the heart of the Course: \"...what is false is false, and what is true has never changed\" (W-pII.10.1:1). It takes willingness and patience with ourselves to learn to recognize what is false, so that truth can be revealed. Jesus tells us in the text: \"Nothing is so alien to you as the simple truth, and nothing are you less inclined to listen to. The contrast between what is true and what is not is perfectly apparent, yet you do not see it. The simple and the obvious are not apparent to those who would make palaces and royal robes of nothing, believing they are kings with golden crowns because of them\" (T-14.II.2:5-7). We do not usually perceive ourselves as emperors with no clothes, yet we must learn this before we can be led to the awareness that not only does the emperor have no clothes, there is no emperor. Although they may not be what we think are spectacular results, there are immediate and significant effects to every step in learning to accept the healing Jesus offers in the Course. The mind is trained to see the ego's dynamics in operation, and then ask the Holy Spirit to transform them. In this process lies the recognition that Someone is with us Who represents the truth. Belief in the part of the mind where He abides is strengthened with each application of the Course's teachings, while belief in the ego is weakened. It is enough that we be willing to practice this: \"Your willingness need not be perfect, because His is. If you will merely offer Him a little place, He will lighten it so much that you will gladly let it be increased. And by this increase, you will begin to remember creation\" (T-11.II.6:6-8). It is great comfort that this will be the certain outcome for everyone, however slow or partial the practice of the Course may be."

    "text_input": "Q #771: I came across a really disturbing passage in A Course in Miracles that I have not found addressed anywhere on the Internet, including on your site. It comes in \"The Justification for Forgiveness\" (T-30.VI). The first two sentences are clear: \"Anger is never justified. Attack has no foundation.\" Since this world is but a delusion made by ourselves, it would be a joke to take it  seriously and get annoyed over something that bothers us (yet we do!). Yet a few sentences later, it says, \"You are not asked to offer pardon where attack is due and would be justified.\" Isn't that a plain contradiction to the previous sentences? And the next paragraph continues this line of thought: \"You do not forgive the unforgivable, nor overlook a real attack that calls for punishment. Salvation does not lie in being asked to make unnatural responses which are inappropriate to what is real,\" etc. So is attack justified or not? What does the Course include under a \"real attack that calls for punishment\"? I thought attack is never in line with God's reality?",
    "output": "This probably ranks up there among the most misunderstood passages in the Course! Our egos read this as Jesus saying that there are those times when attack is justified, when the action of others is so evil that it is unforgivable, and he's not going to ask us to offer forgiveness in those instances, for that would be unnatural and inappropriate. But Jesus' point is just the opposite. He is correcting the world's form of forgiveness, which he calls \"false forgiveness\" in the third paragraph of this section, and \"forgiveness-to-destroy\" in the Song of Prayer pamphlet (S-2.II). Most of us have been brought up with the idea that, no matter how horrible and cruel an act another may have committed against us or one of our loved ones, the truly loving, Christian (if we were raised Christian) thing to do is to \"forgive\" the other person. It may be such a heinous act that nearly everyone agrees that some form of punishment would be only fair and just, yet the Christian thing would still be to \"forgive.\" But this is not the kind of \"forgiveness\" Jesus in the Course is asking of us--that we should forgive anyway, regardless of how unfair such a demand may feel. His point instead is that, because there is no act for which attack in response is ever due, forgiveness is therefore always justified. So, correcting what 2,000 years of Christianity has taught about forgiveness, Jesus is saying that we are never \"asked to offer pardon where attack is due and would be justified,\" for attack is never due and justified, regardless of our perception of the \"crime.\" The problem is never, Jesus asserts over our ego's protestations, the \"crime,\" but our perception of it. In other words, if you re-read these paragraphs with the understanding that Jesus is saying that seeing attack, either in others or in ourselves, is a misperception of the ego and is not real, and therefore attack in response can never be justified., then it becomes clear that Jesus is saying that forgiveness or pardon as the Course defines it--releasing judgment--is always justified. We are not asked to \"overlook a real attack that calls for punishment\" because there are no real attacks that could ever call for punishment when we are in our right mind. That is not to deny that people do insane things that they intend to be hurtful to others, but nevertheless it can only be my own ego-based interpretation that would lead me to perceive them as attacks against me personally. One of the clearest statements of this correction can be found in Jesus' discussion of the crucifixion in the text: \"Assault can ultimately be made only on the body. There is little doubt that one body can assault another, and can even destroy it. Yet if destruction itself is impossible, anything that is destructible cannot be real. Its destruction, therefore, does not justify anger. To the extent to which you believe that it does, you are accepting false premises and teaching them to others. The message the crucifixion was intended to teach was that it is not necessary to perceive any form of assault in persecution, because you cannot be persecuted. If you respond with anger, you must be equating yourself with the destructible, and are therefore regarding yourself insanely\" (T-6.I.4). Jesus did not need to forgive those who crucified his body, because he was not identified with his body. And he did not see the body as himself because there was no guilt in his mind that he needed to project outside his mind to defend against it. We though who still see ourselves as bodies do need to learn to forgive. But we do not need to learn to forgive others. When we feel we are attacked, it is only because guilt is still real in our own mind, and that is where the forgiveness is truly needed. Perceiving others as attacking is only ever the result of our own projected guilt. So when we feel attacked, we need to forgive ourselves. To believe that we need to forgive others for their attacks against us makes forgiveness as the Course teaches it impossible. It is what the Course refers to as making sin real and then trying to forgive it, described beautifully in the following two paragraphs: \"The unhealed cannot pardon. For they are the witnesses that pardon is unfair. They would retain the consequences of the guilt they overlook. Yet no one can forgive a sin that he believes is real. And what has consequences must be real, because what it has done is there to see. Forgiveness is not pity, which but seeks to pardon what it thinks to be the truth. Good cannot be returned for evil, for forgiveness does not first establish sin and then forgive it. Who can say and mean, 'My brother, you have injured me, and yet, because I am the better of the two, I pardon you my hurt.' His pardon and your hurt cannot exist together. One denies the other and must make it false. To witness sin and yet forgive it is a paradox that reason cannot see. For it maintains what has been done to you deserves no pardon. And by giving it, you grant your brother mercy but retain the proof he is not really innocent. The sick remain accusers. They cannot forgive their brothers and themselves as well. For no one in whom true forgiveness rests can suffer. He holds not the proof of sin before his brother's eyes. And thus he must have overlooked it and removed it from his own. Forgiveness cannot be for one and not the other. Who forgives is healed. And in his healing lies the proof that he has truly pardoned, and retains no trace of condemnation that he still would hold against himself or any living thing\" (T-27.II.2,3; italics added)."

    "text_input": "Q #772: I was wondering if it is possible that the Holy Spirit's guidance does not make rational sense to us. I feel that I am being guided toward a job that pays me far less money than others that I have been offered. Now, I am an avid reader of some of your materials and in The Most Commonly Asked Questions About A Course in Miracles you said that \"common sense\" is important to keep in mind when practicing the Course. Now, common sense would tell me that the more money job that would help make my financial life easier is the better route to take. Is it possible that the Holy Spirit's guidance could make no sense to us at the time?",
    "output": "The use of reason is a faculty of the intellect, which is not the home of the Holy Spirit. He abides in the mind, not the brain, and is the symbol of the part of the mind that remembers the truth. The Holy Spirit reflects a thought system that is outside of time and space. Therefore, we may say that the Holy Spirit is never \"rational.\" His goal in A Course in Miracles is healing our minds of the thought of separation, so His guidance leads us to our minds, where we choose to identify with Him or with the ego. It is not focused on behavior, or decisions made on the level of form. This reflects the important distinction the Course makes between form (the body/behavior) and content (the mind). In the text Jesus gives us his common sense approach to resolving problems: \"In any situation in which you are uncertain, the first thing to consider, very simply, is 'What do I want to come of this? What is it for?' The clarification of the goal belongs at the beginning, for it is this which will determine the outcome\" (T-17.VI.2:1-3). This focuses our attention on the content while dealing with the situation as we perceive it in our experience. In asking the questions Jesus suggests, there are two goals to choose between: either to strengthen belief in the ego's message of separation or in the Holy Spirit's message of healing. The choice for healing means willingness to recognize all the fearful thoughts and judgments (confusion, uncertainty, expectations, perceived needs) involved in making decisions in the world. They reflect back to us the ego's perspective, revealing the choice for separation that was made so we can make another choice. In this way, what appeared to be merely a career opportunity becomes an opportunity to learn to forgive ourselves for our mistaken choice. Once this shift to the Holy Spirit's curriculum (content) has occurred, the job options can be considered without the pressure of believing that salvation lies in either of the jobs. Then the common sense that belongs to the level of form can be applied, while the mind remains peaceful. If the goal in everything is to learn the Holy Spirit's lessons of forgiveness, even when a choice on the level of form appears to be a mistake (the job is not what we thought, the salary goes up or down, benefits come and go, etc.), the content of the mind is not altered, nor its peacefulness disturbed. To the ego that is indeed irrational. Every situation becomes a classroom that serves the goal of healing. Thus, following the guidance of the Holy Spirit it is possible to remain peaceful whatever job is decided upon. As Jesus tells us in the text: \"What [the Holy Spirit] enables you to do [change our mind about the purpose of everything] is clearly not of this world, for miracles violate every law of reality as this world judges it. Every law of time and space, of magnitude and mass is transcended, for what the Holy Spirit enables you to do is clearly beyond all of them\" (T-12.VII.3:2-3)."

    "text_input": "Q #773: In answering #538, you mentioned that Jesus stated the ultimate answer to all our questions about our little problems was that God only wishes for us to remember Him. Does He need us? Does God have an ego? What was His motivation to Father a Child? Was He lonely? Is He growing weary of our insanity? Have we overslept? I doubt He's \"concerned\" about our little illusion we call \"life.\" But is He amused?",
    "output": "Let's begin by quoting the lines from #538 that you refer to: \"What could His answer be but your remembrance of Him? Can this be traded for a bit of trifling advice about a problem of an instant's duration? God answers only for eternity\" (S-1.I.4:5-7). The point Jesus is making here is not that God needs us to remember Him, but rather that we need to remember Him so that we may experience true happiness and joy. Nothing but perfect Love can satisfy us. And only by remembering God will we remember Who we truly are. A Course in Miracles, as discussed elsewhere (e.g., see Questions #72 and #156, as well as the audio set Duality as Metaphor and chapter 2 of The Message of A Course in Miracles: Few Choose to Listen, both by Kenneth Wapnick), uses metaphorical language to describe God so that we can have some glimmering of understanding, but only the very slightest, of our true reality as part of perfect Oneness. And while one could certainly conclude that the God of the Bible has an ego, since He makes separation and sin real by reacting to them and first punishing man, then offering him salvation through His Son's death, the Course uses biblical language, such as the Father and the Son, only to provide a correction for the Bible's--both Old and New Testaments--theology of sin, guilt and sacrifice (e.g., see #473ii). And so God is described in the Course in more comforting terms that can help undo our unconscious and conscious beliefs that God is an angry Judge Who demands suffering and ultimately death for all our many transgressions. But the reality of the God of the Course is beyond all words, symbols and descriptions, and beyond all consciousness and perception (e.g., T-27.III.4:4-8; 5:1-2; W-pI.43.2:2; W- pI.198.11:3-6). And so He can not possibly be aware of our insanity, nor concerned about our sleeping and dreaming this illusion we foolishly call life. To God, none of what seems like such a big deal to us, especially ourselves, has any meaning--good, bad, silly, or indifferent. And of course, when we're identified with the ego, which constantly strives after acknowledgment and recognition, we don't like that at all! But at some point, we will begin to think more sanely, and All of Everything will have greater appeal to us than the little bit of nothing we're trying to content ourselves with now (T-9.I.10; T-12.VIII.6; T-14.V.1:8-9)."

However, while I can get a handle on this intellectually, I feel like I'm emotionally handicapped on this one. There are a number of things from my past which are still present in my mind, causing me severe bouts of depression at times, and I have a great deal of trouble releasing them. How can I let go of them? Do I simply \"not think about them\" anymore? Do I ignore them as \"non-existent\"? Every so often, these issues seem to pop back up, and I seem unable to recondition my own responses. They are making me extremely tired, and they have unpleasant effects in my relationships. Help!!!",
    "output": "Bringing purpose into the picture is important for understanding what is happening. Jesus tells us, \"The memory of God comes to the quiet mind. It cannot come where there is conflict, for a mind at war against itself remembers not eternal gentleness\" (T-23.I.1:1-2). Part of us wants to remember our true Identity in God, and part of us is terrified of letting go of our false identity so that we would remember the truth. That fear causes us to do things that would prevent our minds from being quiet, as Jesus indicates in the quote. These are our defenses, and we all have a grab bag full of them that we pull out the instant this fear arises to threaten us. One very effective defense is to recall painful events from the past--this is a \"favorite\" of many students. (How curious that we would resort to something painful to cope with fear!) Recalling the past thus is purposeful, for we then begin to obsess about what happened years ago, as if it were happening right now, and that leaves us with no doubt that we are bodies, the innocent victims of what has been done to us--or we could remember how we cruelly victimized others. We don't realize that this is a defense that is consciously chosen, as are all defenses--an important dynamic that Jesus describes at the beginning of Lesson 136 (W-pI.136). He also points out in a thought-provoking section in the text, \"The Present Memory,\" that \"remembering is as selective as perception, being its past tense\" (T-28.I.2:5). Why are only certain events of the past brought into awareness, when so many other things happened as well? The section in the text called \"Shadows of the Past\" (T-17.III) is likewise enlightening with respect to how the ego uses the past to reinforce in our minds our belief that we are separate. Elsewhere in the text Jesus teaches us about the ego's use of time in contrast to the Holy Spirit's. For the ego, time \"is nothing but a teaching device for compounding guilt until it becomes all- encompassing, demanding vengeance forever. The Holy Spirit would undo all of this now. Fear is not of the present, but only of the past and future, which do not exist\" (T-15.I.7:7; 8:1-2). The context of the discussion is the ego's ferocious need to keep alive its doctrine of sin, guilt, damnation, and hell. Linear time was devised by the ego for this purpose. The Holy Spirit, however, uses time to teach us how to learn only from Him so that we would have \"no cares, no worries, no anxieties, but merely to be perfectly calm and quiet all the time\" (T-15.I.1:1). Once you realize the purpose of recalling the past, you can simply look at that and then dwell more on the purpose of these recollections, than on the past hurts. When you no longer want the purpose served by your remembrance of these hurts in the present, they will be easier to let go. But you never want to try to convince yourself that something is non-existent when it is still causing you pain. That will only worsen the situation. \"Do not fight yourself,\" Jesus emphasizes (T-30.I.1:7). It is fine to have defenses. They are not the problem; the problem is our thinking that we need them. But that takes years of practice to undo, along with patience and gentleness with yourself: \"Defenses, like everything you made, must be gently turned to your own good, translated by the Holy Spirit from means of self-destruction to means of preservation and release\" (T-14.VII.5:8). Finally, it is sometimes a good idea to seek help from a therapist when events from the past are so painful and compelling that you are unable to function well. This would be no different from getting medical help for an ankle injury that prevents you from walking."

    "text_input": "Q #775: Could you talk a little about the process that A Course in Miracles seems to set into motion? Why, even after working with the Course for a long period, is it so difficult to let go of the addiction to this world (i.e., sin, fear, etc.)? Could it be that a part of ourselves (the real Self) has long done so and simply left the remnants of the \"ego\" playing about there \"in darkness\" and doesn't take any interest in it any longer? Is it not simply an illusion that we are still involved here, as God does not teach nor bother with what seems to happen \"down here\"? Will the ego be either healed or destroyed once Atonement is achieved?",
    "output": "You might say that there are two processes that the Course \"sets in motion,\" although both in fact represent very deliberate and conscious choices on our part: forgiveness, and resistance to practicing that forgiveness. Our mind, joined with the Holy Spirit, joyfully embraces the Course's teachings on forgiveness and strives to make its promises (W-pI.122) our reality. Our mind, joined with the ego, resists the release from pain and guilt and fear that forgiveness offers, every step of the way (W-pI.121.2-5; W-pII.1.2-3). This is because we have convinced ourselves that we are the ego, and we believe forgiveness will annihilate who we are. And so we fight desperately to maintain its existence in our mind, not wanting to recognize all the cruel outcomes its thought system condemns us to. Our true Self, the Christ, has never even been aware of the false ego self, and for It there are no remnants or fragments existing anywhere in the mind. So yes, it is nothing more than an illusion that we seem to find ourselves still caught in the world of separation, sin, guilt and fear. But nothing will happen to the ego once we accept the Atonement for ourselves, except that it will no longer seem to exist and, for one brief instant, we will realize that it never has existed. And nothing but this recognition needs to occur for the ego and all its effects to return to the nothingness from which they came (T-10.IV.1:9; M-13.1:2)."

    "text_input": "Q #776: In \"The Justification for Forgiveness,\" Jesus states: \"You are not asked to offer pardon where attack is due, and would be justified. For that would mean that you forgive a sin by overlooking what is really there. This is not pardon. For it would assume that, by responding in a way which is not justified, your pardon will become the answer to attack that has been made. And thus is pardon inappropriate, by being granted where it is not due\"; and later he says, \"You do not forgive the unforgivable, nor overlook a real attack that calls for punishment\" (T- 30.VI.1:6-10; 2:3). What does this mean? What would be considered unforgiveable? Could you present a few instances or examples that illustrate your answer?",
    "output": "This section presents A Course in Miracles' distinctive view of forgiveness. The world's view, which Jesus in this same section calls false forgiveness (T-30.VI.4:1), is that while we at times pardon sinners, we never forget that they have sinned (T-30.VI.3:7). In this sense, they do not really deserve our forgiveness, but we grant it anyway. This kind of pardon is inappropriate, Jesus is saying, for we are attempting to overlook what we think is real, and that simply cannot be done--at least not without sacrificing our rights (T-30.VI.2:6). If we judge an attack as contemptible and deserving of punishment, but then forgive because that is what we think we are supposed to do, we would think that we have forgiven the unforgiveable--an \"unnatural\" response and \"inappropriate to what is real\" (T-30.VI.2:4). An example of this would be forgiving the 9/11 terrorists even though you think what they did was unforgiveable; or less dramatic, forgiving the person who stole your money through a clever scam. In both cases you would think that you have to overlook what was done in order to forgive. Jesus is teaching us that true forgiveness is quite different. This cannot be understood, though, without knowing the metaphysics of the Course. Jesus begins the section with two very important principles: \"Anger is never justified. Attack has no foundation\" (T-30.VI.1:1-2). When people attack, they do so as a reaction to their own state of fear. They have rejected love and identified instead with the ego thought system, which rests on nothing real. This is a mistake or an error, not a sin. Jesus is asking us to learn to see beyond the behavioral attack to its origin in the mind. This does not mean that we deny what our eyes see; it means that we learn how to give the situation a different interpretation. This is only about what goes on in our minds. Instead of the \"normal\" inclination to retaliate and punish, we learn how not to take personally what anyone else does, for we would know that we (in our right minds) are invulnerable and can never lose the peace that is our natural inheritance as God's Son, and we know the same is true for everyone else as well. If these principles are the basis of our perception, then it would be impossible to condemn the \"attacker,\" regardless of what was done. (Again, this does not rule out prosecution, etc.) We would be aware that this act has come from the profound terror in the person's mind, the result of his having made the wrong choice. How can that be condemned? Thus Jesus says, \"you are merely asked to see forgiveness as the natural reaction to distress that rests on error, and thus calls for help. Forgiveness is the only sane response. It keeps your rights from being sacrificed\" (T-30.VI.2:7-9). If you shift from your wrong mind to your right mind, in other words, you would perceive everyone as sharing with you the same wrong mind, the same right mind, and the ability to choose between the two. In that vision, terrorists are the same as those they attack; scam artists are the same as those they cheat. That is the only sane way of perceiving each other and what goes on in this world. Forgiveness, then, is meaningful and completely honest. The behavior is not denied; it is seen at its point of origin in the content of the mind. (See also #771.)"

Our experience as bodies (form) is an illusion; the projection of a thought in the mind (content). The content is either love (identifying with the Holy Spirit) or fear (identifying with the ego). The way we are able to determine whether the mind has chosen the ego or the Holy Spirit is by the presence or absence of judgment. Judgment of any kind means the ego's thought of separation has been chosen. We can also be certain that the ego has been chosen whenever we perceive differences; i.e., any form of specialness.

    "text_input": "Q #779: I am currently working through \"Many Forms; One Correction\" (T-26.II). In this section, A Course in Miracles states what I have been thinking of the Course from the start, that from the perspective of the Holy Spirit, it is the most irrelevant exercise. But the ego might be drawn into the Course in its desire to \"undo\" \"sin\" and find \"deliverance\" from something it never did. The passage I am referring to is: \"This one mistake, in any form, has one correction. There is no loss; to think there is, is a mistake. You have no problems, though you think you have. And yet you could not think so if you saw them vanish one by one ... \" (T-26.II.3:1-4).  So is the Course trying to bait the ego into greedily biting on its offerings, so that the ego will invariably be drawn out of its natural living circumstance and die, devoured by the great spirit of One? Why should I want to do the Course at all, other than to have a laugh? Is it not all a joke by the Holy Spirit, playing with the idea of \"sin\" that our egos made, offering the ego resolution to its \"problems\" in the form of \"deliverance\"? Isn't deliverance impossible?",
    "output": "You are indeed correct in your final observation--deliverance ultimately is impossible. For nothing has happened in reality and so there truly is nothing we need to be delivered from except our own mistaken beliefs--the separation never happened. And that is the statement of the Atonement principle, which is repeated over and over again in various forms throughout the Course. This principle is the basis for the Course's teachings on forgiveness--\"a happy fiction\" (C-3.2:1), \"an illusion [which], unlike all other illusions...leads away from error and not towards it\" (C-3.1:3-4). Early in the text, in the context of the idea of return--but we could just as easily substitute the word deliverance--Jesus says: \"The ego can accept the idea that return is necessary because it can so easily make the idea seem difficult. Yet the Holy Spirit tells you that even return is unnecessary, because what never happened cannot be difficult. However, you can make the idea of return both necessary and difficult\" (T-6.II.11:1-3). There is certainly some truth to the idea that Jesus presents his message in the Course in a way that can sound appealing to the ego--offering us release from pain and suffering, and escape from guilt (e.g., W-pI.195.2). And most of us, when we first come to the Course, are attracted to it because we think it will help us lead happier lives in the world, healing our relationships with all those difficult people \"out there\" whom we must deal with. By the time we have begun to understand what Jesus' intention really is--to help us awaken from the dream rather than simply make it a better dream (T-29.IV.1)--it is almost too late to turn back. For we know too much and we are beginning to recognize our own part in all of it! Now, from our perspective as egos, it may appear that Jesus is ensnaring us in a giant cosmic trap which will, in the end, lead to our demise. But that can only be our perception if we continue to identify with this false self, the ego. Jesus' intent rather is to help us shift our identification from the ego and its manifestation as a body, to our identity as a mind with the power to choose between judgment and forgiveness in the dream, and ultimately, to our true Identity as spirit. And with this shift, no loss is possible, since we are speaking only of the disappearance of illusions. And so one conclusion you draw cannot go un-addressed. Identified with the ego, it may seem to us that the Holy Spirit is playing a game with us, manipulating illusory symbols to entice us into seeming self-annihilation, perhaps out of some warped sense of humor. But that would mean that we could somehow be a victim of a mind outside ourselves that views us only as a means for its own entertainment. And again, we could only view the situation this way if we are identified with the ego. For we are spirit, although we have forgotten. And Jesus and the Holy Spirit are only symbols of our own making, available to us while we still believe we need help from outside ourselves. The help They represent is simply our own right-minded choice to release the ego and remember Who we are. There is no mind separate from our own, no Jesus, no Holy Spirit, Who has developed a plan to give us the Course and either save us or play with us. We have given ourselves the Course, but we have forgotten that we have. And so that is why we may want to \"do the Course,\" because the alternative is the continuing ego belief in the reality of sin, guilt, fear, and pain, which are then our experience. But if we already know the world is a joke that we're playing on ourselves, and our only response is to laugh at everything within it (T- 27.VIII.6), then we certainly would not need the Course!"

His body did not represent any thought of death or disease or pain in his mind, since his mind was free of guilt. He did not use his body to reinforce a belief in sin and victimization in his mind (T-6.I.5)--and so it remained incorruptible in his perception, despite how its form may have seemed to change.\"  If I break my leg, I would feel extreme pain even though the Course says physically this is impossible, because there is no leg to break. #542 says that a shift from body to mind comes only through practicing forgiveness, which I understand means to forgive my brother for what he has not done. That is, nothing happened and no reaction is required.  History speaks of Jesus dying horribly upon a cross, which must mean that my mind did not accept his thoughts of himself but rather chose to destroy him for reasons that you have mentioned many times in this forum. Therein lies the frustration. Intellectually I understand what I do to him I do to myself, yet after many years of practice I remain deeply rooted in the world.",
    "output": "You're being so hard on yourself! It can be helpful to understand the Course's metaphysical principles and to know where in the end Jesus is leading us, but not if we use its explanations of what will be the final steps in our healing as a measuring stick against which to judge ourselves now, as it sounds as if you're doing. The fact that Jesus knew he was not his body (T-6.I.4) in no way means that he expects us right now to accept and experience ourselves as anything other than bodies, as we begin to put his teachings on forgiveness into practice. He is not asking us to deny that the pain we seem to experience in our bodies feels very real to us, nor to deny what our brothers seem to do to us also seems to be very real and to have effects on us. Jesus is only asking that we begin to question our interpretation of everything we experience and be open to an alternative explanation, which must come from outside our ego/body-based thought system. And to be able to begin to make the shift, we must first understand the purpose behind the interpretations we give to all of our experiences as bodies now. We want the pain to be experienced in our bodies and we want to see others as attacking us so that we can remain victims of forces outside of our control. And consequently, we remain unaware of the real cause of our pain--our decision to see ourselves as separate from love. But again, Jesus is not asking that we embrace his interpretation of our lives, but rather that we be willing to question the validity of ours. He offers his, not so that we try to force ourselves to look at situations in the same way he does, but just so that we can come to recognize that there may be a very reasonable alternative to our interpretation. If I think my immediate goal is to see the body as nothing, pain as unreal, and my brother as doing nothing to me, I will find the Course a very frustrating and self-defeating process. And Jesus would be an unreasonable teacher if those were his expectations for me. But they are not. The Course is intended to be a very gentle process that begins by asking us to accept ourselves where we think we are. And it also is asking us to be willing to be honest with ourselves about what the outcome has been while we have continued to put ourselves in charge of our own happiness. For if we are honest, we will have to admit that we have not been doing a very good job. It is through recognition of our own failure to attain peace and happiness that we become willing to allow Jesus to be in charge of the thoughts in our mind. And that is all that forgiveness is really about--letting go of our own judgments and interpretations of the events and people in our lives so that Jesus can offer us an alternative interpretation that does not reinforce separation and guilt. Over time, as part of a lifetime process of practicing forgiveness, we will have less and less of an investment in our own interpretation of what is happening to us and, in particular, who and what should be held responsible for our unhappiness. Increasingly, we will be willing to turn away from the belief in guilt in our mind and, as a result, will have less of a need to project guilt outside our mind onto others and onto our own body. Very gradually, as a secondary effect of the forgiveness process, although not our focus, we will find we are less identified with the body and its needs, and we will increasingly come to recognize that all pain comes from a thought in the mind and has nothing to do with the body. But this understanding is not where we begin, nor will it be our experience until we are well along our path of forgiveness. By the way, most New Testament scholars agree that the accounts of Jesus death in the gospels were not written by eye witnesses to the events of his life. And so the narratives, to the degree that they were intended to portray actual happenings, most certainly were colored by the projections of the narrators, who believed in the reality of sin, guilt, pain, suffering and the body, as their theology clearly demonstrates. And to the degree that we accept the same theology of the ego, we too will believe that Jesus must have suffered in his crucifixion and that we are somehow responsible for it. The fact that he lives in our mind (T-11.VI.7:3-4), un-accusing and completely accepting, suggests otherwise, and his words in the \"The Message of the Crucifixion\" (T-6.I) provide that alternative interpretation. And so, while you may believe that what you have done to Jesus you do to yourself, his message is that we have done nothing to him, and so therefore, over time, as we learn to forgive, we will come to realize that we have done nothing to ourselves."

    "output": "Because all authentic spiritual teachings are leading in the same direction--towards an experience of oneness which transcends the false self, the finite ego--it is very likely that similarities and parallels in content can often be identified between paths. Certainly that can be said for the teachings of Joel S. Goldsmith and A Course in Miracles. Both, for example speak of our real existence as spirit, that the material world is an illusion and the body is merely an idea that expresses what is in the mind, that error or sickness is in the mind and not in the body, and that healing is the result of correcting a false belief in the mind. And yet there are differences. For example, Joel Goldsmith speaks of God as Consciousness expressing itself. The Course, in contrast, speaks of consciousness as \"the first split introduced into the mind after the separation\" (T-3.IV.2:1). The Holy Spirit, the Voice for God in the dream according to the Course, is more nearly equivalent to the concept of Consciousness that Goldsmith refers to in his teachings. In addition, Goldsmith speaks of God as the life, mind, body, and substance of individual being, and of the body as existing as the idea of God. And therefore, we will never be without conscious awareness of the body, nor without the body. The Course, in contrast, views the body as the embodiment of the ego's wish that the separation be real (W-pI.72.2:1-3), and teaches that the body nevertheless can be given a different purpose, that of healing and forgiveness, under the Holy Spirit's guidance. The body then will simply disappear from the mind once its usefulness to the Holy Spirit for healing is complete. And the emphasis of the Course, therefore, on looking at the ego and its thoughts of hatred and attack and guilt, is simply not reflected in Goldsmith's approach. This is not to say that one is right and the other is wrong--they are merely different. For as Jesus reminds us near the end of the Course, \"A universal theology is impossible, but a universal experience is not only possible but necessary. It is this experience toward which the course is directed\" (C-in.2:5-6). To the extent that both teachings lead us to release all of our preconceptions about how things should be, what our physical and emotional lives should be like, and any effort to control the external to achieve our personal goals, they are both fostering a nonjudgmental acceptance, which is what the Course means by forgiveness. And so both would be leading us toward the same universal experience. Although addressed to the issue of different teachings on the Course itself, #48 provides a helpful perspective on thinking about the relationship of the Course to other spiritual paths, such as Goldsmith's."

Would there be one single definitive line or instruction that I could post around my daily environments (work/home/car) which I could stick to and which would ensure that I am 'doing the right thing' by the Course? I am desperate for some clarity.",
    "output": "First, the most helpful thing you can do for yourself is to stop worrying about \"doing it right.\" If there is one thing that stands out in the Course it is that Jesus is interested only in the content in our minds, not in what we do or how perfectly we carry out his instructions. It is only our willingness to do what he says that has a bearing on our spiritual progress--that we would want to do what he says. Thus, he says \"trust implicitly your willingness, whatever else may enter. Concentrate only on this, and be not disturbed that shadows surround it. That is why you came. If you could come without them you would not need the holy instant\" (T-18.IV.2:3-6). The \"shadows\" would be our resistance and all the concern, confusion, and complexity in our minds; and because of these shadows in our minds Jesus must say the same thing in many different ways. But, as he teaches us in Lessons 79 and 80, there is only one problem--separation--and it has been solved (W-pI.79, 80). Concern and confusion arise only because we have not yet accepted this. Thus Jesus counsels us: \"Only be certain you do not forget that all problems are the same. Their many forms will not deceive you while you remember this. One problem, one solution. Accept the peace this simple statement brings\" (W-pI.80.3:3-6). What would help you therefore is to learn to see the common content behind the different forms of the instructions in the Course. Second, it is important to realize that by trying so hard and being so intent on \"doing it right,\" you are making the error real, and in that sense, working against your desire to return home. Although it is a paradox to us, we must recall that we are really undoing something that never happened. That is what the journey home is about: simply realizing that we never did anything that we need to undo; we just think we did. So whenever you feel pressure about this journey, you have dropped Jesus' hand and are allowing the ego to accompany you instead. Granted, we must learn which is which, but one thing is for sure, Jesus is very gentle and very patient, and he would never pressure us to \"get it right.\" In view of all this, your one definitive line could be something like: Remember to smile when you find yourself trying really hard to be serious."

    "text_input": "Q #785: I am fairly new to A Course in Miracles and presently find myself in an uncomfortable \"no-man's land\" spiritually. My previous approach to God and Jesus led to a major spiritual awakening, that resulted in a seeming limitless upward spiral into peace, joy, and a profound shift away from fear, worry, resentment, judgment, and depression for three years.  Recently I stumbled upon the Course, and found it not only intriguing, but resonant. However, in the process of moving the furniture around in my head, it \"pulled the carpet out\" from underneath my previous model of relating to my dear, sweet, ineffably beautiful Teacher. To confront the fact that there is no interaction in this life; indeed no Jesus or Holy Spirit in \"reality,\" has left me bereft and more than a little confused. Was my peace and certainty somehow a sham, a forgery, an hysterical foray into false spirituality? I am still committed solely to grasping what is Truth, not some magic words or a formula to restore my previous \"bliss.\" I'm just a little disrupted and uncoordinated in my efforts get through these next steps.",
    "output": "The Course tells us that \"teaching [which, is the same as learning] is a constant process\" (M- in.1:6). The helpful word here is process. Awakening from the nightmare of separation is a process taking place in the mind, where a decision is made not to choose the ego. This decision takes place in stages described in the manual in the section \"Development of Trust,\" and is expressed and experienced in different forms made up of symbols, until at the very end of the process the mind decides to choose only the truth. Your experience is described in the fourth stage Meanwhile, because belief in the body is maintained we have need of symbols, which change along the way: \" ... we need a many-faceted curriculum, not because of content differences, but because symbols must shift and change to suit the need\" (M-23.7:5). Thus, a symbol or form that was helpful at one stage of the journey may no longer be needed or suitable at another time. Religious beliefs and practices, figures such as Jesus and the Holy Spirit, words, A Course in Miracles, are all symbols. When a symbol changes, it does not mean that it was false; it simply means that it has changed. Your experience, therefore, was not a forgery; it was an important step in the process. The choice made in your mind remains with you as you come to the Course. Nothing is lost, as Jesus assures us in the text: \"I have saved all your kindnesses and every loving thought you ever had. I have purified them of the errors that hid their light, and kept them for you in their own perfect radiance\" (T-5.IV.8:3-4). He also tells us in the manual that on the journey there are periods of rest and reasonable peace for the teacher of God. Yet there are further steps to take, and \"when he is ready to go on, he goes with mighty companions beside him\" (M-4.I.A.6:11). When the mind makes a decision against the ego, the specific religious context in which it is made is irrelevant, in fact, a religious context is not even necessary. The effect of the experience is the lessening of fear. As layers of fear are removed, light enters and is again experienced in some form in an upward spiral toward the truth, each step facilitating the next. This is the gentle process of awakening that makes use of symbols to lead us beyond them. Although the symbols are not real, while we are asleep, \"dreaming of exile\" (T-10.I.2:1), they are useful when given to the Holy Spirit for the purpose of healing. In this regard, the Course simplifies the process by teaching that everything is helpful. There is nothing that the ego made to support belief in the separation that cannot be used by the Holy Spirit to undo it. Intellectually we may understand that spirit is formless and nothing outside of Heaven exists, but as Jesus tells us in the text, \"Everything you recognize you identify with externals, something outside itself. You cannot even think of God without a body, or in some form you think you recognize\" (T-18.VIII.1:6-7). Therefore, as long as the choice for a separate self is maintained, there is need for a figure, perceived as separate from the self, to represent the Self that has been denied. A relationship with such a figure is very helpful. So although the Course teaches that ultimately nothing in the illusion is real, Jesus invites us to have a relationship with him. He uses the loving image of himself as an older brother (T-1.II.4) who meets us where we believe we are, and leads us gently to where he is: \"Let my relationship to you be real to you ... Be not separate from me, and let not the holy purpose of Atonement be lost to you in dreams of vengeance ...Let me enter in the Name of God and bring you peace, that you may offer peace to me\" (T- 17.III.10:2,6,8). There is no need, therefore, to feel bereft of a loving teacher. Through the words of the Course and in every step of the practice of forgiveness, Jesus is with us representing the part of the mind that remembers God's Love: \"Jesus has come to answer [your need]. In him you find God's Answer. Do you, then, teach with him, for he is with you; he is always here\" (M-23.7:6-8). When we finally learn from our experience (not intellectual understanding) that we are the Self that he symbolizes, we will no longer perceive ourselves as separate from him or anyone else. Only then will formlessness replace all symbol. Until then, we may be grateful that we do have a brother, a teacher, and a Course to guide us to the happy dream that precedes full awakening: \"Helpers are given you in many forms, although upon the altar they are one. Beyond each one there is a Thought of God, and this will never change ... Thank God for them for they will lead you home\" (C-5.1:3-4,9)."

Will I eventually make a snap decision for love once and for all? After studying the Course for a while I began to experience the negative things I had previously kept hidden from myself. This made me feel like abandoning the Course. I am not sure what to do. If I focus only on love, will I be denying the anger, lust, greed, etc.?",
    "output": "When the mind chooses separation, the first thing it does as a follow up is to deny having made the choice. This denial is key to the ego's success in making the illusion of separation seem real. Denial is therefore the foundation of the ego's thought system. It follows that one of the most important steps in undoing belief in the ego is to uncover what has been denied. If it is exposed, it is no longer denied. That is why Jesus tells us: \"No one can escape from illusions unless he looks at them, for not looking is the way they are protected ... We are ready to look more closely at the ego's thought system because together we have the lamp that will dispel it, and since you realize you do not want it, you must be ready. Let us be very calm in doing this, for we are merely looking honestly for truth. The 'dynamics' of the ego will be our lesson for a while, for we must look first at this to see beyond it, since you have made it real. We will undo this error quietly together, and then look beyond it to truth\" (T- 11.V.1:1-6). The looking begins, as your experience shows, with an acknowledgment of the suppressed hatred that masks fear and guilt, which are the effects of choosing to believe the separation is real and specialness is preferable to oneness. Deeper within, and hidden beneath the guilt and fear, is the memory of God's Love that Jesus tells us is what we truly fear: \"You are not seriously disturbed by your hostility. You keep it hidden because you are more afraid of what it covers. You could look even upon the ego's darkest cornerstone without fear if you did not believe that, without the ego, you would find within yourself something you fear even more. You are not really afraid of crucifixion. Your real terror is of redemption\" (T- 13.III.1:7-11). All the ego's schemes, therefore, are designed to defend against Love's memory/our redemption. They make up the layers of denial and defense that the Course leads us to uncover through the study and practice of its teachings. Resistance to looking at the darkness within is a camouflage for resistance to looking at the light within, which frequently is experienced by Course students as a desire to get rid of the book. You have a lot of company in your dilemma. It is important to proceed gently through the process of uncovering, and very important to remember what Jesus tells us emphatically: \"Do not be afraid of the ego\" (T-7.VIII.5:1). Nevertheless, our focus must be on looking at what it has made: \"You cannot lay aside the obstacles to real vision without looking upon them, for to lay aside means to judge against. If you will look, the Holy Spirit will judge, and He will judge truly. Yet He cannot shine away what you keep hidden, for you have not offered it to Him and He cannot take it from you\" (T-12.II.9:6-8). In order to allow the Holy Spirit to judge what we look upon we must look without any judgment of our own. When we become afraid or distressed by what we see of the ego's antics, it is because we have judged them as sinful and taken them seriously. This perpetuates the guilt that keeps us rooted in the illusion, guarantees a firm grip on specialness, and keeps the Holy Spirit out of the picture. Thus, guilt and fear are kept alive and well, and love's presence is blocked from awareness. Love need not be sought, for it is not lost. Our focus is in the removal of fear, which lets love's light dispel the darkness. Love then replaces fear because it was always there: \"You who have tried to banish love have not succeeded, but you who choose to banish fear must succeed ... When we have overcome fear--not by hiding it, not by minimizing it, and not by denying its full import in any way--this is what you will really see\" (T-12.II.9:1,5; italics added). As fear recedes and the ego's specialness becomes less attractive, it becomes easier not to choose it. This is a gradual learning process, rather than a sudden \"snap\" into the right mind. The judgments, grievances, and accusations that serve as obstacles are removed by choosing not to hold on to them. But first they must be recognized. Love cannot be revealed if anger, greed, or any form of fear is denied. Again, denial keeps fear in place, which blocks love from awareness. We need focus only on what Jesus teaches: \"Do not leave any spot of pain hidden from His [the Holy Spirit] light, and search your mind carefully for any thoughts you may fear to uncover\" (T- 13.III.7:5; italics added). And a little later in the text he tells us: \"You need but leave the mirror clean and clear of all the images of hidden darkness you have drawn upon it. God will shine upon it of Himself\" (T-14.IX.5:5-6)."

Sometimes, though, it is much more than a preference, what Jesus refers to as an investment--in the section in the text of A Course in Miracles called \"The Investment in Reality\" (T-12.III). If there is a real charge to your decision not to associate with this person, you have gone from a preference to an investment, meaning you have linked your salvation to not associating with him or her, and you would then be withholding love from this person. The decision then would have come from the ego, and judgment would be involved. The lesson in the section referred to is that salvation is attained only through peace, which is in your mind, not in having a situation or relationship in the world be a certain way. #595 speaks to this issue, as do pages 24 and 25 in Vol. I of our The Healing Power of Kindness."

It is the witness to your state of mind, the outside picture of an inward condition. As a man thinketh, so does he perceive.\" (T-21.in.1-6). Was the crucifixion of Jesus the witness to his state of mind, the outside picture of his inward condition? Or does the passage above mean something different than what it says?",
    "output": "A Course in Miracles teaches us that perception is always an interpretation--coming from our identification in our minds either with guilt (the ego) or with love (the Holy Spirit). Perception is not simply a fact based on what our physical eyes see (T-21.V.1:7; M-17.4). The crucial point with regard to the issue you raise is that there was no guilt in Jesus' mind--no thought of attack--and therefore he perceived his being crucified simply as his brothers' call for help. With only love in his mind, he could perceive only calls for love or extensions of love. No other interpretation is possible when there is only love in one's mind. This is evident when he discusses the crucifixion in Chapter 6 in the text. In speaking of our freedom to choose to perceive ourselves as persecuted, Jesus advises us, \"When you do choose to react that way, however, you might remember that I was persecuted as the world judges, and did not share this evaluation for myself ... I therefore offered a different interpretation of attack ...\" (T-6.I.5:3,5). He explains further: \"I elected, for your sake and mine, to demonstrate that the most outrageous assault, as judged by the ego, does not matter. As the world judges these things, but not as God knows them, I was betrayed, abandoned, beaten, torn, and finally killed. It was clear that this was only because of the projection of others onto me, since I had not harmed anyone and had healed many\" (T-6.I.9). And finally: \"The message of the crucifixion is perfectly clear: Teach only love, for that is what you are. If you interpret the crucifixion in any other way, you are using it as a weapon for assault rather than as the call for peace for which it was intended\" (T-6.I.13:1-14:1). Thus, again, Jesus did not perceive himself as assaulted or persecuted even though nails were hammered into his body, etc. His \"inward condition\" was one of love and invulnerability, and therefore the \"outside picture\" for him was fearful brothers calling for love. What the body's eyes see is only form, and that is not the basis of perception according to A Course in Miracles."

As I have hard evidence, and in the light of the teachings, should I now report them to the police? I agonize as much over this question as I did over the spurious court claim. Even if this attack is illusory, should I not prevent its repetition for the sake of future \"victims\" who also suffer in a world of illusion?",
    "output": "The forgiveness A Course in Miracles teaches is directed to a change of mind, not to any type of behavior. It is therefore possible to apply its teachings while reporting a crime to the police, filing legal suits, or doing any of the normal things involved in living in the world. The important thing is to be aware of the judgments based on differences that arise in any situation. For this purpose, the instructions in Lesson 21 are meant to be generalized and applied to every circumstance in which we find ourselves: \"... search your mind carefully for situations past, present or anticipated that arouse anger in you. The anger may take the form of any reaction ranging from mild irritation to rage. The degree of the emotion you experience does not matter. You will become increasingly aware that a slight twinge of annoyance is nothing but a veil drawn over intense fury\" (W-pI.21.2:2-5). When this simple exercise is practiced diligently, hidden emotions, thoughts, and judgments are brought to awareness, revealing the unconscious choice, made in the mind, to believe the separation is real. Bringing this choice to awareness is the first step in the process of undoing the thought of separation that is the goal of the Course. The next step lies not in changing behavior in any way, nor in trying to change the judgments, but rather in accepting responsibility for the choice and acknowledging there is another choice that can be made. While we believe we are in the world, we generally \"give to Caesar the things that are Caesar's\"; i.e., we obey the rules of the world in form (file law suits, police reports, etc.). At the same time, we practice the Course by paying attention to the thoughts and judgments that arise in every situation. They reflect back to us the choice for separation that was made in the mind (content), and has been denied. It is important to remember this distinction between form and content whenever a decision about behavior must be made. A situation such as you describe is replete with opportunities to see many of the ego's favorite themes in operation; not the least of which is the victim/victimizer plot. Again, the important thing is to pay attention to our thoughts, all of which are based on perception of differences that stem from the one thought of separation that is held in the mind. In this way, everything from rooting for your favorite baseball team to filing a police report is an opportunity to become aware of the choice for separation that has been hidden, denied, and protected. Only when this choice is brought to awareness can the process of its undoing through forgiveness begin. To the ego, the differences it perceives in all our experiences are important and purposeful. They support its belief system and prove it right. These differences make life complicated and keep us thoroughly involved. Yet it is only belief that the illusion is real that makes it seem that some situations are more serious than others, or some form of behavior is more spiritual than another. In the Course, Jesus tells us: \"No illusion has any truth in it. Yet it appears some are more true than others, although this clearly makes no sense at all. All that a hierarchy of illusions can show is preference, not reality\" (T-26.VII.6:3-5). This clearly relieves us of having to make the \"right decision\" on the level of form. Whatever course of action is decided upon, the only question worthy of consideration is whether to choose the ego or the Holy Spirit as teacher. Choosing the ego keeps attention focused on the drama of the situation as it appears in form, while the Holy Spirit brings the content of the mind into focus. Thus, the only thing that makes any specific behavior \"right\" or \"wrong,\" helpful or useless, is which teacher is chosen as guide. In this regard Jesus asks: \"'Would you be hostage to the ego or host to God?' Let this question be asked you by the Holy Spirit every time you make a decision. For every decision you make does answer this, and invites sorrow or joy accordingly\" (T-15.III.5:1-3)."

If the events are ego-based then the Holy Spirit \"simultaneously\" creates events that are diametrically opposed to what the ego has created. From all of these possibilities the decision maker then selects a particular event for us to experience. How is it that the decision maker can pick an event that does not bring us happiness? I have had many situations where I am faced with a decision and I decide that a particular scenario is what I want--yet it does not work out as I had imagined. I know A Course in Miracles says that we do not perceive our own best interest but in some situations it is not difficult to decide on a happy outcome but often, such is not the case.",
    "output": "I'm afraid the ego may have you hoodwinked! For the Course's explanation of how events seem to unfold and how choices are made in our lives is not quite as you have described it. And when you hear the Course's explanation, you may have a better understanding of why the outcomes you believe will make you happy do not always turn out as you expect. First of all, a clarification of terminology. Jesus makes a distinction between creating and making (T-3.V.2), reserving the term creating for the extending activity of the Father and the Son as spirit in Heaven. Creating in the Course has nothing to do with anything in the world of time and space. Making is used for the activity of the split mind, whether it comes from the ego or the Holy Spirit. The ego mind makes, or mis-creates, the world and all the events of our seeming lives, and the Holy Spirit provides their correction (T-25.III.4:1-3; 5:1-3). The Course also teaches that time is not linear and that everything that can possibly happen has already happened all at once in the mind in that single, unholy instant, when the thought of separation was taken seriously (T-26.V.3). And what we see as a fresh new event is simply a preexisting thought in the mind, waiting to be selected by the decision maker, projected outward, and re-experienced (W-pI.158.4; M-2.2-3). And for every ego-based thought, predicated on the belief in separation and attack, the Holy Spirit holds the correction, which is not a specific event in response to the ego's error, but rather a different way of looking at the ego's error that basically says, \"This is not real. Separation and attack have no reality.\" Now the story becomes interesting, as we uncover the ego's hidden motivation that explains why the events we choose so often result in outcomes that are other than the happy ones we have anticipated. The ego has made up its entire library of possible events as a smokescreen, to hide the underlying content they all share. And that content is the guilt over the thought of separation, which the ego says is ours for wanting to attack love and have something other than the perfect Oneness of Heaven. The ego does not want us to see that, by choosing separation, we are excluding ourselves from love and have already made a choice for unhappiness and pain. The choice could not have any effect in reality (T-13.VIII.3:3-5), but it seems to as a result of our dedicated belief in separation. Rather than allowing us to accept responsibility for the pain and unhappiness that come from choosing against love, the ego wants us to see the cause of our unhappiness as lying anywhere but in our own decision. And so the thought of separation was splintered into all the possible events of all the possible lives that could possibly be experienced by all the possible fragments of the split mind (T-18.I.4). But their content is always some representation of limitation and loss and emptiness, because of their source. And so the ego's choices will always end up producing some sense of disappointment (T-13.VII.3), which we will attribute to the external situation or condition, rather than to the thought of separation in our own mind. And that is exactly the ego's goal for the world, that we will think that the world is disappointing us--we are its victim-- rather than recognizing that the feelings of unhappiness are coming from our own inner, hidden decision (T-27.VIII.7-8,10-11). So whenever we think we are a body with needs, who is unhappy in our present state, we are identifying in our mind with the ego's thought of separation. Then, whenever we think we know what needs to happen in the world outside of ourselves in order to have our needs met and be happy, we have simply reinforced unconsciously the thought in our mind that we are separate, which is by definition an unhappy thought. And so, as long as we leave ourselves in charge of the decision of determining what we need to be happy, we are doomed to failure (T-12.V.8:1-5). Perhaps not always in the short run, for the ego is no fool, and knows that an intermittent schedule of reinforcement, such as the payoff for gambling, is the surest way to maintain a high level of participation. But the outcome eventually must be recognized as unhappiness, for the ego's \"rewards\" are always temporary, and down deep we always know that. That is why Jesus invites us in the Course to give control of our thinking to him or the Holy Spirit (e.g., T-2.VI.1). And this does not mean that we are letting them choose the events of our lives. Rather, it means that we are willing to look at our belief in our present state of need through Their eyes, and realize that our sense of lack is not coming from anything that is truly missing either inside or outside of us, but rather is coming from a mistaken belief about ourselves (T-4.IV.3). And it is this false belief that we need Their help in correcting, rather than the provision of something external to meet our perceived need. Once we make this shift to Their way of perceiving, we may in fact find external events shifting in such a way that we believe our happiness is resulting from getting what we think we want. But this is where we have to be especially vigilant, for this is nothing more than the ego's trick to bring us back into its thought system of lack and loss. So when our choice for what we think we want in the world seems to disappoint us, it is only because we have surrendered our thinking once again to the ego's agenda. And that is always an unconscious choice for unhappiness, with the responsibility for that unhappiness projected outside our own mind onto external events over which we seem to have little or no control. And the good news, of course, is that our happiness does not depend on anything outside ourselves, but is always available to us simply by our own choice to change teachers in our mind (W- pI.64.1-2,4-6). The book A Vast Illusion by Kenneth Wapnick addresses many of these issues about the decision maker, choice and time in greater depth."

    "text_input": "Q #792: A Course in Miracles' non-dualistic metaphysics defines the physical universe and everything in it as illusory, a defense against the truth of Heaven's undifferentiated oneness. But if the physical universe is a defense, sharing none of the characteristics of Heaven, how then do we explain what physicists tell us about the interconnectedness of everything on the quantum level? Is this not exactly what the Course defines as Heaven? And does it not indeed exist in this world, even if you really have to squint to see it?  As I understand it, Jesus seems to be saying that he or the Holy Spirit can use the world of illusion for Their holy purpose. Nonetheless, inherently these defenses (the material world) are still illusory--a big, fat lie--and share nothing whatsoever in common with the truth as God created it. And yet we have physicists and a number of New Age teachers speaking about the perfect, undiluted oneness just below the surface of consciousness! If the \"tiny, mad idea\" projected a world of lies to disguise its hideous inward condition, why did it include a spark of truth?",
    "output": "There are a couple of things you may want to keep in mind. First of all, the ego is one, single, unitary, illusory thought, and no matter how much deceptive complexity it may try to impose on that one thought through seeming division and fragmentation, it remains one thought. Jesus makes this point in \"The Substitute Reality\": \"You who believe that God is fear made but one substitution. It has taken many forms, because it was the substitution of illusion for truth; of fragmentation for wholeness. It has become so splintered and subdivided and divided again, over and over, that it is now almost impossible to perceive it once was one, and still is what it was. That one error, which brought truth to illusion, infinity to time, and life to death, was all you ever made. Your whole world rests upon it. Everything you see reflects it, and every special relationship that you have ever made is part of it\" (T-18.I.4; italics added). So complexity is an illusion, and everything in the seemingly vast physical universe comes from that single thought of separation and guilt. Despite the ego's frantic and furious efforts at disguise, its simple origins, which are so easily dismissed by the simple solution of the Atonement principle--the separation never happened--can never be completely concealed. The difference between the oneness of Heaven and the ego's oneness is that Heaven is truly one, while the ego is truly nothing. However, before we can recognize that the ego is nothing, we first have to look at the thought of sin and guilt that it insists it represents. But of course neither of these propositions for the universe's foundation--sin and guilt, or nothingness--is something that most quantum physicists or New Agers are considering. And it is not interconnectedness that defines Heaven, for interconnectedness still implies differentiable parts that may ultimately be connected at a deeper level. In Heaven, there are no differentiable parts. The other point to remember is that the so-called physical universe exists within the split mind. And it's the split mind that retains the spark of truth, the memory of God's Love, and not the physical universe, since there is no physical universe. And that mind, when joined with the Holy Spirit--the right mind which holds the memory of true oneness--can see the ego illusion in a completely different light, and begin to see past the deceptive complexity it has attempted to impose on our perception. Without a perspective such as the Course offers, which comes from completely outside the ego thought system, it will seem as if the simplicity of consciousness at the core of the universe is itself real. And yet it is only the split mind when it first fell asleep, before any of the diversionary fragmenting, that gave birth to consciousness, a single unitary ego state (T-3.IV.2:1-2). Most spiritual paths, other than the Course, see consciousness, which necessarily implies the duality of a perceiver and a perceived, as real. We find that only the very highest teachings of such spiritual traditions as Hinduism see that even consciousness remains in the realm of duality and must therefore ultimately be illusory."

He says that since his first wife died, he has not loved another woman. I want him very much, but feel very uncomfortable being with someone who doesn't love me. According to A Course in Miracles, there is either love or fear. Since there is no love, I guess it is fear. I can understand where his fear comes from. My question is: what is the Course's advice for me. How can I feel good in this situation, and not take it personally. Am I supposed to love him unconditionally without expecting anything? How can I do it without being afraid of being left? Emotionally I feel worse now than I did before I met him and was not in any relationship.",
    "output": "Is it possible to love someone who does not love us in return and who does not provide the things we think we are looking for in a relationship? From the world's perspective, no, at least not without a feeling of sacrifice and loss, with anger and resentment buried beneath that, rising to the surface from time to time. And while the Course is leading us toward the possibility of that kind of love without conditions, it is not asking that of us now as its students. If we were capable of that kind of love, we would not need the Course, for our minds would already be healed and we would not be looking to anyone outside ourselves to meet our needs, including the need to be loved. We would know with certainty that the love is already there, present within our own mind. Jesus knows we are not yet capable of that kind of love and so through his Course invites us to learn the lessons of forgiveness that will lead us to this kind of love. The lessons come to us in the context of our special relationships and do not depend, by the way, on whether we physically remain in the relationship or not. The Course's concern is not with what we do but with how we look at what we do. Relationships bring us up against the self-imposed limitations we've accepted to restrict our experience of love. But we seek to put the blame for any lack we feel on our relationship partners--that's actually the ego's purpose for all of our relationships. Yet others are not the ones who make us feel deprived--we are (T-4.IV.3:3)! And so each relationship in which I find myself ready to judge the other for how I feel or for what I believe is lacking in me can be used for a different purpose. With the Holy Spirit's help, it can become the mirror that allows me to look deeply within my own mind to see the accusation I am holding against myself--that I am the one who has limited love by putting my own needs above everything and everyone else. While I want to see the guilt in the other, there is nothing I can do about it. But once I see it within myself, I have a choice about whether I want to continue to make it real by keeping love away. If I am willing to let the love in by joining with Jesus in looking at my guilt, the self-accusation will disappear, replaced automatically by the experience of love. And from this place of perfect joining, I will recognize in my partner's fear of love that same need for healing that I have just recognized within myself. And from that place of wholeness within, there is nothing to be done but to let the love flow through me and encompass my partner as well as myself in the love that we are all already truly a part of. Whether he is willing to accept that love right now will not be my concern, for I will see the two of us in the same light of forgiveness and know that the outcome is certain, regardless of what our bodies may do. A beautiful passage in the text describes this process: \"Make way for love, which you did not create, but which you can extend. On earth this means forgive your brother, that the darkness may be lifted from your mind. When light has come to him through your forgiveness, he will not forget his savior, leaving him unsaved. For it was in your face he saw the light that he would keep beside him, as he walks through darkness to the everlasting light\" (T-29.III.4; italics added)."

    "text_input": "Q #794: You often say the ego thought system is based on perceived separate interests, while the Holy Spirit's thought system, in contrast, is characterized by our all sharing the same interest in undoing the dream of separation. Now it is surely the case that the social system that currently dominates the world expresses, and in turn reinforces, the dog-eat-dog mindset of the ego, thereby undermining any sense of shared interests, except when these are mobilized against some \"external\" threat.  Given the illusory nature of the world, it must of course follow that any and all social systems that man has devised are illusory as well. Even so, it does seem to me that some forms of social organization might be more conducive to the perception of shared interests--and that, conversely, the present world system is particularly well suited to the promotion of the fear, vulnerability and aggression on which the ego thrives. Or does any of this really matter in the end?",
    "output": "In the end, it does not really matter. But it is not simply because the world, and all the social systems within it, are illusory. For the value of everything in the world, while we still believe the world is real, depends only on what purpose it is given. Anything used for judgment and attack is valueless, for it is being used to reinforce a meaningless thought system. Anything used for forgiveness and joining has the only real value anything in the world can hold. Each of us always has the choice to see either separate or shared interests, regardless of what appears to be happening in the world around us. And as much as the ego may wish us to believe that form affects the content of the mind, which is what is behind your question, the world of form only ever reflects the collective content of the Son's split mind. Any shift must first occur in the mind, whether we are conscious of that choice or not, and only then can it be reflected in the world of form. The purpose of A Course in Miracles is to help make that choice conscious. That is why Jesus tells us in the Course, \"seek not to change the world, but choose to change your mind about the world\" (T-21.in.1:7). It is in fact worth quoting the entire paragraph in which this admonition occurs: \"The world you see is what you gave it, nothing more than that. But though it is no more than that, it is not less. Therefore, to you it is important. It is the witness to your state of mind, the outside picture of an inward condition. As a man thinketh, so does he perceive. Therefore, seek not to change the world, but choose to change your mind about the world. Perception is a result and not a cause. And that is why order of difficulty in miracles is meaningless. Everything looked upon with vision is healed and holy. Nothing perceived without it means anything. And where there is no meaning, there is chaos\" (T-21.in.1:2-12; italics added). In other words, the only meaningful question is which teacher have we chosen to guide our perception. If we choose the wrong teacher, we can only see some form of specialness--either special love or special hate--around us. But if we choose the right Teacher, we will be guided to see in everything around us either an extension of love or a call for the love that we each believe we have thrown away (T-12.I.3:1-4). There are no other alternatives, which is what makes the Course so simple. Once we become concerned with form in the world, we are caught in the ego's web of complexity, and the possibility of healing and release will seem daunting, if not hopeless. It is even possible that when the forms of the world, such as specific social systems, appear to be encouraging what we may believe to be shared interests, they may in fact simply be reinforcing the very deceptive special love relationship that the ego holds out as its \"most boasted gift\" (T- 16.V.3:1). For they may be simply covering over the ugliness of the ego's thought system, keeping a lid on the guilt, but doing nothing about undoing it in the mind. The point is, we can never judge what is most helpful with any confidence based on form. For example, was the politeness and civility of the first half or so of the 20th century, at least within the United States, which some folks speak so nostalgically about, really bringing the Sonship closer to awakening from the dream than the uncivility and overt attack that seems so pervasive in today's world? We may have our opinions about what is more helpful, based on our perspective of ourselves as bodies in the world who want to feel safe and secure, but we are simply not in a position to judge. Perhaps yes, but just as likely, perhaps not. Unfortunately, it does appear that fear and pain are the greatest motivators for asking for another way. And the ego is eager to foster the complacency that comes from having one's life function smoothly and comfortably, with everyone \"helping\" everyone else. The point is not that we should value pain and attack, but that we want to be vigilant in every situation and circumstance for the choice we always have between the ego and the Holy Spirit. And that choice becomes clearer only as we become increasingly aware of our ego in all its subtle and not so subtle expressions."

    "text_input": "Q #795: I have a question about the following passage from the manual on the holy relationship between two people: \"As with the first level, these meetings are not accidental, nor is what appears to be the end of the relationship a real end ... Yet all who meet will someday meet again, for it is the destiny of all relationships to become holy\" (M-3.4:4,6). Does this imply the idea of karmic relationships until total forgiveness on both sides has been learned?  A personal example: I became friends with someone who seems very similar to me. But over time she became hostile towards me and as a result I became hostile towards her. I found myself quoting A Course in Miracles when things got worse between us, but then I was accused of being crazy and even mentally ill. The more I opened myself, the more it seemed I was accused and attacked. I honestly started doubting my own sanity after a while.  It feels that we had to part in hostility. But it is a horrible state of affairs, and I find myself blaming the Course rather than my ego for the outcome. Yet I strongly feel deep regret and a willingness to end the dispute now and make this a good relationship again. But I don't see how I can do this and forgive myself without her. It seems we have to wait for \"a next life\" repetition. Is there another approach I do not see?",
    "output": "There is another approach that offers you an answer right now, but you would have to be willing to set aside many of your assumptions about what has happened in this relationship and why, and what the Course has to say about it. And none of this requires that you deny your experience, but only that you be open to a different interpretation of the situation and the problem. To begin with--the passage you cite does seem to suggest future lives and karmic relationships and, on the level of how we experience our lives, this may certainly be true. But there is a deeper level of meaning, which becomes clearer as we begin to grow in our understanding of the Course's teachings--on the nature of who we are as mind and how we defend against the truth in our mind. Every difficult, hostile relationship we see outside ourselves reflects an unhealed spot of guilt and hatred within our own mind. And until that spot of darkness within is healed, we will continue to deny it in our own mind and project it outside ourselves in the form of difficult, conflictual relationships, so that we don't have to heal the spot within--in other words, the projection of the guilt is very deliberate, if still unconscious (T-6.II.1-3). But at some point we must come to the realization that the inner and the outer are the same (W-pI.31.2:5; W- pI.32.2:1), and that the relationship that truly needs healing is within our own mind--the relationship with our wrong mind, and not with anyone who seems to be external to us. The \"meeting again\" that the passage refers to is in fact a meeting with the part of our own mind that we have denied and projected outside ourselves so that we don't have to accept responsibility for it. And so it is inevitable, and no accident, that we will meet that unhealed thought again (and again), projected onto a seemingly external relationship, until we realize that it is only ever ourselves that we need to learn to forgive. In other words, the other person is simply holding up a mirror for us that allows us to see the contents of our own mind reflected back at us. See for example, T-7.VII.3:9-10; T-24.VI.8; T-31.VII.8:4; W-pI.73.5:1; W- pII.304.1:3-4. Since the mind of the Son is one, it is inevitable that we will heal all our projections so that our holiness and oneness can dawn once again upon our mind --\"it is the destiny of all relationships to become holy\" With this view of the manual passage you cite in mind, let's turn to the personal example you provide and consider an alternative way of thinking about how that relationship developed and how it can be healed. It is interesting that you have a sense that you and your friend are very similar, or at least perhaps felt that way when you first met. Since every external relationship must represent a split off part of ourselves, a sense of similarity is not at all unexpected, although we more often choose to focus on the differences rather than the similarities, a favorite ego device that provides the foundation for either special love or special hate (T-15.V.8:2-4; T- 18.I.2). Your experience then was that she changed and became hostile, which in turn caused you to become hostile. That of course is exactly how our egos would like us to perceive the shift to special hate, that our feelings are triggered and elicited by the other's attacks. But the Course suggests a very different explanation--that we would never react with anger and hostility to someone else's hostility unless we believed the guilt within our own mind was real and were looking to defend against it by holding someone else responsible for our feelings of hurt and upset (T-27.VII.1,3-4,7). Another's hostility can have no effect on us if we do not first believe we are guilty. Now most of us do believe we're guilty, at least unconsciously--guilty of attacking God and separating from love--and so we experience others' attacks as real and deserving of attack in return. But that is all just part of the insanity of the ego thought system. Your reaction, by the way, of trying to use the Course as a defense against her attacks is a natural one, but almost never helpful. The Course's purpose is only to help us look within and see ourselves differently, after which we will see others differently. It is not intended as a method for changing someone else's behavior towards us. So employing it for any purpose but healing our own perceptions will invariably serve the ego's purpose of increasing conflict. If someone else is already identified with the ego, it is likely they will perceive a verbal defense based on the Course as crazy, even \"mentally ill,\" as you learned in your dealings with your friend. In most situations, the words of the Course are best kept to yourself, as a guide and support to your own inner thinking, and not to be used as a tool for attempting to change anyone else's perceptions. Another common, related error students make with the Course is to see it as a guide for behavior rather than for thinking (T-4.IV.2:1; T-21.VII.7:8). Your observation that you blame the Course rather than your ego for the outcome of the relationship suggests you have fallen into that trap. Now this is not to say that there may not be valuable forgiveness lessons in your experience with your friend, but forgiveness lessons only ever present themselves after we have first turned to our egos for guidance. So long as we remain under the Holy Spirit's direction, our egos will not be involved, there will be no anger or guilt, and no need for practicing forgiveness. Of course, this is the ideal that we are striving for, but it is likely to be our experience only intermittently as we progress over time with putting the Course's principles into practice. Your own experience may have not been so conflict-filled and painful if you had been able to recognize from the beginning that all your reactions to your friend represented projections of your own guilt and really had nothing to do with her hostility towards you. Granted that is a very difficult lesson to learn, and not one that the ego will readily allow us to accept. Most of us will first try to \"fight the good fight\" before we become willing to look at and begin to deal with the consequences, and then perhaps ask if there is another way, as you are asking. The final point to be made, which may perhaps be apparent from what we have discussed already, is that since the healing that the Course is attempting to bring about is a healing of the thoughts of guilt and anger within our own minds, which our external relationships only bring into our awareness, it is not necessary that your body and the body of your friend, in this lifetime or in any other lifetime, physically come together again, despite what the ego may teach (T- 15.VII.8). Now it may seem easier to uncover that buried guilt in the \"presence\" of its projection onto an external relationship, but you can still continue to work on healing the relationship by looking at the guilt in your own mind with Jesus or the Holy Spirit, independent of what your friend chooses to do in relationship to you. If it really required the physical presence of someone else for healing to occur, then we would genuinely be at the mercy of others in our forgiveness process. But the Course makes it very clear that we are never the victim of the world we see (W- pI.31) and so, rest assured, any further healing awaits only your own willingness. It is even possible that some change with your friend at the level of form could follow your change of mind from judgment to forgiveness, but this would only ever be the effect of the inner shift, and never a cause or a prerequisite for it."

    "text_input": "Q #796: As I learn to draw distinctions between the ego's voice, and that of the Holy Spirit, it actually becomes more difficult to view the ego without judgment--that is, as a value-neutral illusory effect. The ego has intelligence. The ego has an agenda. It is desirous of and intent upon self-preservation, and as such--a thinking, choosing, \"intelligence\" with an agenda for its own survival--it is very difficult for me not to see it as an \"entity.\" A pretty darn \"non-neutral\" entity. I can still choose against the ego, but I suspect that my ability to really \"choose again\" in the sense that Jesus calls us to, will be divested of the miracle if I am unable to \"choose for forgiveness.\"",
    "output": "The ego is a thought. It is the name given to the thought of separation taken seriously, and it is the cause of the illusory world. When the mind chooses separation, the tremendous guilt that results is projected out, and does indeed seem to give the ego a life of its own as an entity, giving rise to the entire physical universe, which certainly seems real. This attests to the power of the mind to misuse its creative ability, rather than the power of the ego as an entity. The ego does not have any power of its own; it is merely the expression of the mind that chooses separation. This repeated choice of the mind sustains the \"agenda\" of the ego. In A Course in Miracles, Jesus clarifies for us the true characteristics of the seemingly \"intelligent\" ego, and gives us several good reasons not to take any judgments regarding the ego seriously: \" ... the ego knows nothing ... is nothing ... is incapable of understanding content ... makes no sense\" (T-8.II.1:9, T-11.II.7:6, T-14.X.8:1, T-9.III.3:3). Nothing it makes means anything, because it makes illusions (T-9.III.3:4; W-pII.332.1:1). We would accept these statements and dismiss the ego without another thought, but for our fear of identifying with the power of the mind that makes the ego's nothingness seem powerful, intelligent, and substantial. Fear of the mind indeed makes the ego seem ominous. Thus, we do not understand the ego or the mind, and fear them both. Fortunately, we are not asked to make choices for or against what we do not understand, but rather to take small steps in the practice of forgiveness in our everyday lives. The ego is divested of its seeming, autonomous existence as an entity by our remembering that the mind is the active agent, and is responsible for choosing. Recognizing the ego's dynamics as the inevitable effect of the mind's choice for separation is how to look at both the ego and its antics without judgment. This important principle is the foundation of the Course's teaching of forgiveness. The mind must be recognized as the real source of every experience in the illusion, including the perception of the ego as a force to be reckoned with. It may be tempting to translate the old excuse to avoid responsibility: \"the devil made me do it\" to \"the ego made me do it.\" However the power of the mind that gave rise to the ego in the first place, is thereby negated, the choice for separation is camouflaged, and hope for any real change is lost. What Jesus tells us toward the end of the text applies until the Atonement is complete: \"What waits in perfect certainty beyond salvation is not our concern. For you have barely started to allow your first, uncertain steps to be directed up the ladder separation led you down. The miracle (forgiveness) alone is your concern at present\" (T-28.III.1:1-3). A choice is made for forgiveness and against the ego each time we are willing to look at a relationship differently, by recognizing in it the judgments that reflect the mind's choice for separation, instead of limiting our perception to what the eyes see. That is the miracle. And, as Jesus tells us, this is our only concern for now. Our hope lies in taking these small steps that will lead us to the final choice, and then back home to God."

    "text_input": "Q #797: Does the true Self know about the dream?",
    "output": "The true Self, God's Son, knows only the Father's Love, and knows not an identity apart from Him. In that unity with God, he is not aware of the dream, just as God is not aware of it. In the workbook, Jesus describes the true Self in terms that make it clear It cannot know about the dream of separation: \"This Self alone knows Love. This Self alone is perfectly consistent in Its Thoughts; knows Its Creator, understands Itself, is perfect in Its knowledge and Its Love, and never changes from Its constant state of union with Its Father and Itself\" (W-pI.rV.in.4:4-5). Thus, one with Its Source, whole, and certain of Its Identity, the true Self cannot ask the questions, \"Who am I?\" or \"Am I dreaming?\" It knows Its Identity and is awake in that knowledge, not asleep dreaming of a false, separate self. The dreamer of the dream (the mind) holds the memory of the Self, rather than the Self knowing about the dream. The question of the dream arises only when the mind has already chosen to believe that the dream of separation has indeed occurred. In this choice, the mind actively chooses against the Self and falls asleep. The dream thus begins with a profound dissociation from our true Identity, experienced by the mind as a vast, dark, void, which is then filled with a false identity that does not really exist at all, just as the figures in a nocturnal dream are not real. The conflict at the core of the dream of separation is, therefore, an identity crisis: \"There is no conflict that does not entail the single, simple question, 'What am I?' Yet who could ask this question except one who has refused to recognize himself?\" (W-pI.139.1:6; 2:1). The mistaken-identity dilemma is compounded by the belief that the true Self actually belongs to the dream figure \"self,\" and is somehow identified with it. This is the source of much of the confusion in understanding the message of A Course in Miracles, which is addressed to the mind, not to the individual identified with a body. In fact, the right mind of the Sonship that remembers God and is symbolized by Jesus is the source of the Course. This is the part of the mind that is aware of the dream. The mind's choice to return to its true Identity is reflected in the process of learning the Course's important teaching that we are dreaming a dream of separation, from which we can awake: \"Nothing at all has happened but that you have put yourself to sleep, and dreamed a dream in which you were an alien to yourself, and but a part of someone else's dream\" (T-28.II.4:1). Through the practice of forgiveness, we attribute our experience in the dream to the power of the mind, not to anything external to it. In so doing, we gradually learn to identify with the mind rather than with the figure in the dream. This returns to our awareness the power of the mind to choose differently and ultimately to awaken from the dream. In a single, simple answer to our question of identity, Jesus defines our true condition, our dream state, and the power of the mind to take us from one to the other: \"You are at home in God, dreaming of exile but perfectly capable of awakening to reality\" (T-10.I.2:1). Each application of the principles of forgiveness in our relationships leads us closer to full acceptance and the awakening he promises."

    "text_input": "Q #798: I have recently been exposed to prophecies about impending doom to the earth within the next decade. Global warming, earthquakes, volcanoes, storms, pollution, nuclear war. If one isn't ready through prayer and meditation, apparently after death I could be in danger of being unconscious for a long time. I know my thoughts are not pure, I struggle with the clouds, when I do meditate and invite God, I don't feel this huge presence, however I do feel comforted in knowing that He is there even though I don't feel Him there. How should I view these prophecies?",
    "output": "The prediction of catastrophic events are certainly true since they are already well underway in our world. Our concern, therefore, is not with the veracity of the predictions, but rather with our interpretation of them. As Jesus tells us in the text: \"The test of everything on earth is simply this; 'What is it for?' The answer makes it what it is for you. It has no meaning of itself, yet you can give reality to it, according to the purpose that you serve\" (T-24.VII.6:1-3). We are also told that there are only two possible answers to the question: everything serves either the ego's thought system or the Holy Spirit's. The ego interprets everything in support of the belief that the world is real and has an effect on us. The Holy Spirit interprets everything as an opportunity to learn through forgiveness that the world is not real, and that nothing external to the mind has any effect on it. Given these two choices, the only truly catastrophic event is choosing to believe the ego. This choice takes place in the mind and gives rise to the guilt that is the only cause of fear, which is then experienced as fear of disasters, feelings of impending doom, and countless other forms of upset. The true cause of these feelings is in the mind's choice for separation, whereby the Son of God obliterates from His mind all awareness of His true Identity, and identifies with the body. The world with all its conflicts and disasters is the result. The message Jesus gives us in A Course in Miracles is: \"Nothing at all has happened but that you have put yourself to sleep, and dreamed a dream in which you were an alien to yourself, and but a part of someone else's dream\" (T-28.II.4:1). The dream is a nightmare in which natural disasters are inevitable. In fact, life in the world is itself a disaster; an unnatural disaster for God's Son who was created one with Him: \"It [the world] symbolizes fear. And what is fear except love's absence? Thus the world was meant to be a place where God could enter not, and where His Son could be apart from Him\" (W-pII.3.2:2-4). This world, therefore, cannot be anything but a fearful place, with or without predictions of catastrophic events. Our goal in studying the Course is to awaken from the dream by learning that we are not the bodies that inhabit this world, it is not our home, nor can we find in it any hope for peace. Our hope lies only in accepting that we have a mind that can be healed of the thought of separation by choosing to look differently at the world. Thus, as students of the Course, we hear Jesus saying, \"seek not to change the world, but choose to change your mind about the world (T- 21.in.1:7). This is accomplished by seeing the world as a classroom to practice the forgiveness Jesus teaches in the Course, which makes every experience the same, whether it be judged on the world's terms as good or bad, pleasant or unpleasant. A catastrophic event is an opportunity to get in touch with the tremendous fear generated, not by an earthquake or volcanic eruption, but by the eruption of guilt for having chosen to be separate from God. Salvation lies in healing the mind of this thought, and forgiveness is the prayer that makes it possible. This process is not an activity of the body, and therefore does not begin with its birth nor end with its death. There is no prolonged state of unconsciousness to fear after the death of the body because the body does nothing: \"The body neither lives nor dies, because it cannot contain you [the mind] who are life\" (T-6.V-A.1:4). The death of the body, therefore, has no effect on the mind's choice for separation. More importantly, the mind's choice to believe the separation is real has no effect on the truth. Jesus makes this clear by telling us: \"Sleep is no more a form of death than death is a form of unconsciousness. Complete unconsciousness is impossible\" (T-8.IX.4:7-8). Thus our only need is to pay attention to the thoughts of judgment that reflect the mind's mistaken choice to be separate, keeping us rooted in the dream, so we can eventually accept that in truth \"[we] can rest in peace only because [we] are awake\" (T-8.IX.4:9). For the Course's teaching regarding psychic abilities see the manual for teachers (M-25)."

    "text_input": "Q #799: My question is about having a certain level of comfort and abundance in the physical world. I am aware now that money and possessions and such really don't mean anything and cannot be counted on to make one happy. At the same time I am in this world for the foreseeable future and it is a bit of a drag not having the money to make the journey a little more comfortable. I have tried without success to attain financial abundance through many different New Age programs. I wonder why I just don't seem to be able to master this area. Can you direct me to anything in A Course in Miracles that might address this? So money cannot make you happy, but not having enough is not the answer either. Am I wasting my time with affirmations and such? Lack seems to be in my mind all the time. How can I reverse this? I mean I know the world is an illusion but my bills don't seem to be. I'm sure there is a way of following the Course and not having to live in lack.",
    "output": "Your observation that lack seems to be in your mind all the time actually holds the key to the solution. You see, you're not experiencing lack because you don't have enough money; you're experiencing lack because you are identified in your mind with the ego, which is a thought of lack (T-3.V.2:2,4-5). And whether you accept this or not, nothing at all in your external financial circumstances needs to change for your experience to shift from a sense of lack to a sense of abundance (T-1.IV.3). That is the change the Course can help you with--and not with how to have more money in your life. Sorry. Now if you are interested in having a different experience, regardless of your financial situation, the first step in undoing the experience of lack is not through affirmations of abundance, as you have been attempting. For affirmations deny the fact that we actually want and are choosing to experience lack in our lives. And it is with that acknowledgment that we must begin. For, as the Course so uncompromisingly puts it: \"I am responsible for what I see. I choose the feelings I experience, and I decide upon the goal I would achieve. And everything that seems to happen to me I ask for, and receive as I have asked\" (T-21.II.2:3-5). But why, you may reasonably ask, would we be choosing to see lack in our lives? The choice is a defense, serving the ego's purpose of keeping our focus on the world, rather than on the thoughts in our mind. We joined the ego in making the world and these \"needy\" bodies with which we identify so that we would not look within at the underlying belief in lack and limitation in our mind. And that belief comes from our choice for the ego, the thought that we could be separate from Love, the only true Abundance (T-12.III.6). And why would we not want to look at the underlying thought of lack in our mind? The ego tells us, don't look within, because the lack in the mind is a reminder of our sinful attack on God, which left us on our own, deprived of love, in a state of loss and scarcity. And He remains there in our mind, seeking to take away what little we still have, as vengeance for our attack, if He can ever find us. But Jesus exposes the ego's lie in all this: the ego does not want us to look within because it will be evident to us if we do that the lack and loss are made up, and that God's abundant Love remains always available, awaiting only our acceptance. And with that recognition, we would let go of our allegiance to the ego and our investment in loss and lack (T- 21.IV.1-3). Although it is true that our mind has chosen the events and circumstances of our lives, it is more helpful--while we still believe we are bodies in the world rather than the mind that is dreaming the world--to acknowledge that we have chosen our interpretation of those events and circumstances. It is our interpretation after all that determines how we experience what seems to happen to us (M-17.4:2). And there are only two possible interpretations of everything in the world. With the ego as the interpreter of our lives, we can only experience lack and limitation, regardless of our external circumstances. In other words, we could have all the money in the world, but we would still feel empty and impoverished if our allegiance remains with the ego. And so the next step, after we have accepted responsibility for choosing to experience a sense of lack, is to recognize that there is a different Interpreter of our lives, Who can help us begin to remember the truth about ourselves, that we have never attacked love and that we have always continued to exist in the abundance and fullness of God's Love, despite our ego beliefs to the contrary (T-1.IV.4:8; W-pI.165.6:5-6). Now coming to this recognition is likely to be a process for most of us, as we become afraid of love and its limitlessness, and return to the ego and its interpretation of who we are and how little we deserve. But once we begin to accept the truth about ourselves, we can never be completely fooled by the ego again. And the possibility of interpreting our circumstances differently will be an increasingly accessible option, to see in them only an opportunity to practice forgiveness, as our willingness to ask for help grows."

    "text_input": "Q #800: Please comment on the Christian dictum that we should hate the sin but not the sinner, that we should condemn the wrong but forgive the wrongdoer.",
    "output": "It is important first of all to clarify that this is, in fact, a dictum (saying), not a teaching found in scripture. It is based on the Christian teaching that sins can be forgiven. From the Christian perspective, the highest expression of this forgiveness would be to treat a sinner with kindness, mercy, and compassion, in the hopes that he/she will \"repent and sin no more.\" Fundamental to Christianity is the belief that sin is real, and that salvation requires repentance as well as abandonment of the sinful behavior. This perspective is, no doubt, the origin of the dictum. A Course in Miracles has a different message. Jesus tells us in the text: \"There is no sin\" (T- 26.VII.10.5). Therefore, there can be no sinner, no wrong, no wrongdoer. There is nothing in the Course about behavior of any kind, because the Course is teaching us to change our minds, not our behavior. The basis for this is one of the Course's fundamental principles that thoughts remain in the mind, where they originate: \"Ideas leave not their source, and their effects but seem to be apart from them. Ideas are of the mind. What is projected out, and seems to be external to the mind, is not outside at all, but an effect of what is in, and has not left its source\" (T- 26.VII.4:7-9). Thus everything is a projection of a thought in the mind. Every judgment is the expression of a judgment against ourselves, made in the mind. We cannot, therefore, dissociate the sinner from the sin, because we cannot dissociate ourselves from the thought in the mind that gives rise to the judgment. The only source of the perception of sin/sinner is the mind's judgment that the idea of separation is a sin and has had real effects. This is the original attack on the Son of God. He is deemed to be a grievous sinner for refusing to accept His only true Identity as God's one Son. The world and all its \"sinners\" is the projection of that attack thought. However, since the thought in the mind has been denied, and the Son's Identity replaced with the identity of the body, we need to look at the projected version in the world to see in it what the mind has chosen to believe: \"The world you see is what you gave it, nothing more than that. But though it is no more than that, it is not less. Therefore, to you it is important. It is the witness to your state of mind, the outside picture of an inward condition\" (T-21.in.1:2-5). The form of the projection is not important, it is the content that reflects the state of mind. Though you may not accuse yourself of a specific sin or wrongdoing (murder, rape, etc.), there has been an accusation of sinfulness made in the mind that is reflected in the judgment against another in the dream. The recognition that everything is a projection of the mind is how the Course teaches us to distinguish the \"sinner\" from the \"sin.\" It is, however, a reversal of the dictum you quote, in that the \"sin\" (thought in the mind/cause) is where attention should be focused, and the \"sinner\" (projection of the thought in the body/effect) is merely a reflection in the illusory world. Because nothing and no one external to the mind has any effect on us, Jesus' message to \"Be willing to forgive the Son of God for what he did not do\" (T-17.III.1:5) leads us beyond the Christian dictum mixed with condemnation and forgiveness, whatever the alleged \"sin\" may seem to be."

    "text_input": "Q #801: What is the cause of \"natural disasters\"--\"acts of God\" (earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, etc.)?",
    "output": "A Course in Miracles teaches that the world and all events in the world have the same cause: the choice of the decision-making mind outside time and space to identify with the ego thought system. This choice initiates a series of dynamics involving denial and projection that reinforce the belief that the separation from God has really happened, but that the responsibility for it lies elsewhere. The ego wants us as far away as possible from our reality as minds, lest we realize that being separate from God is not a good idea, and we decide to change our minds about being separate. The ego's strategy, thus, is to make us mind-less, which it does by convincing us that, for our own survival as individuals, we should project ourselves out of our minds, forget that we did that, and then believe we are bodies in a world ruled by the forces of nature, or whatever. Our new identity requires that we become the innocent victims of what is done to us. Earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, etc., are thus a necessary part of the ego's strategy, for if we are victimized by what is external to us, then we can in no way feel responsible for what happens, and we would be safe forever from our minds with all the guilt and fear residing in them. The ego's plan for our salvation thus requires that we experience ourselves, not as minds, but as vulnerable bodies subject to forces that do not appear to be of our own making. God, of course, has nothing to do with this. Jesus, though, as the reflection of God's Love within our otherwise deluded minds, helps us to question our beliefs and open our thinking to another way of perceiving ourselves and the world. He does this throughout his course, but to focus on one place in particular, he tells us in Lesson 14: \"The world you see has nothing to do with reality. It is of your own making, and it does not exist\" (W-pI.14.1:4-5). In the exercise in this lesson he asks us to \"think of all the horrors in the world that cross your mind ... Say, for example: 'God did not create that airplane crash, and so it is not real. God did not create that disaster ... and so it is not real'\" (W-pI.14.4:1,4,6-7). As he continues, he teaches us that the world's horrors are only in minds that believe they are separate from God's Mind, and are therefore meaningless (W-pI.14.6:6)."

Her parents are not followers of A Course in Miracles, although I think they will be sometime as they are reaching the age of questioning their thought system.",
    "output": "In the light of the Course's teaching, your granddaughter is right and wrong, and she speaks for all of us. Her declaration reflects the part of the mind that knows it has the power to choose, has some awareness that a \"bad\" choice has been made, and feels guilty about it. This describes the universal angst at the heart of \"everyone who wanders in the world uncertain, lonely, and in constant fear\" (T-31.VIII.7:1). Her hidden guilt and its companion fear are the source of her call for love, as they are in countless forms for everyone. She rightfully expresses the painful effects of the mind's choice for separation and identity with the ego: \"Depression is an inevitable consequence of separation. So are anxiety, worry, a deep sense of helplessness, misery, suffering and intense fear of loss\" (W-pI.41.1:2-3). This may seem to be an overstatement for a six-year- old's frustration, but it is in fact, at the root not only of her discomfort, but of every conflict in the world, however insignificant or monstrous it may seem to be. On another level, in your granddaughter's statement we hear her longing (also shared by everyone) to be told that she is wrong; that there is nothing to feel guilty about because her \"sin\" has had no effect. This is as true for anything she thinks is her fault in the dream, as it is for the \"original sin\" of believing that separation from God is possible and has been accomplished. Jesus' response in the Course gives her the ultimate reassurance and comfort that we all seek: \"God's Son will always be as he was created ... for his eternal guiltlessness is in the Mind of his Father, and protects him forever\" (T-13.I.5:7-8). Thus, although we and your granddaughter are right about the feelings of guilt that follow the choice for separation, we are wrong in believing that the great sin of separation has destroyed our oneness with God. A Course in Miracles does not give guidelines for behavior, since it only addresses the mind of the Sonship, and its goal is to teach us to use the power of the mind to choose the Holy Spirit instead of the ego. Because the mind is not the body, there is also no age distinction in the Course, so \"your brother\" refers to everyone, whether they be 6 or 66. We are asked, therefore, to apply its teaching equally in every relationship because in it we recognize our own need of healing: \"You have learned your need of healing. Would you bring anything else to the Sonship, recognizing your need of healing for yourself? For in this lies the beginning of the return to knowledge ... In whatever part of the mind of God's Son you restore this reality, you restore it to yourself. You dwell in the Mind of God with your brother, for God Himself did not will to be alone\" (T-11.I.1:1-6). Therefore, in response to any call for help we first remember our own desperate plea that is joined with the call for love shared by all the Sonship. If something in another's behavior sparks fear in us, we see our own need for help and can then turn to the Holy Spirit in our minds, Who answers that call. That is all we are asked to do. Although this may not seem like much of a response, it has great significance. It reinforces belief in the power of the shared mind by hearing the content rather than the form, and acknowledges the presence of the One Who speaks for God to us. Returning to the mind in this way is how to teach and learn what Jesus advises: \"Look gently on your brother, and remember the ego's weakness is revealed in both your sight. What it would keep apart has met and joined, and looks upon the ego unafraid. Little child, innocent of sin, follow in gladness the way to certainty\" (T-21.IV.8:1-3). This process in our minds is how we practice the Holy Spirit's curriculum in any relationship when fear is perceived. If we adhere to this practice, the content of whatever we say will communicate comfort and reassurance. In the role of an authority figure for a young child, setting limits and offering guidance concerning the choices that must be made on the level of form will then be guided by the Holy Spirit, Who will not reinforce guilt. For your granddaughter, for everyone, whatever form it takes, the content of His message remains: \"God's Son is guiltless, and sin does not exist\" (M-10.2:9). That is what we want to teach and learn."

Also, I asked Jesus to please send help, and suddenly people are showing up for me to help. Now my question is: Is this what is meant by the right-minded choice? Is it that what I am now perceiving as peace and help a manifestation of right-mindedness? Or is it just the ego projecting out to soothe the pain a little to keep me from rejecting myself totally.",

If your experience is one of peace and relief from guilt and grief and pain, the best thing is simply to accept the shift without trying to judge or evaluate what it means. Since we all have split minds, it is likely that our reactions to any event will vacillate between right- and wrong-mindedness. In the end, everything is a symbol projected from the mind, and its value depends only on what interpretation we give it. From a right-minded perspective, symbols lead us gently and gradually towards awakening. From a wrong-minded perspective, the same symbols will keep us rooted in and identified with the dream. Beyond that, there is little more that we need to know."

    "text_input": "Q #804: Why does the dream have to look so real and the real so much like a dream?",
    "output": "The dream fulfills our (the separated Son) need to be as God did not create us. We need the dream to be real so that what is real vanishes from our awareness. Thus: \"When you made visible what is not true, what is true became invisible to you\" (T-12.VIII.3:1). We rejected what is real (Oneness), believing we could produce a substitute more to our liking (separate, individualized existence). So to make this work for us, we had to do whatever would convince us that what is real is not real and what is not real is real. Once we believed we had accomplished this, it became imperative for our continued survival to keep the denial going and believe the illusion is reality. If you decide that it is necessary for your own protection to deny a fact and pretend something else happened instead, then that is what you would do, especially if you think it is a matter of life or death. And if your defense is going to be effective as a defense, it must convince you that you are safe from the threat. \"To the ego illusions are safety devices, as they must also be to you who equate yourself with the ego\" (W-pI.13.3:3). This is why Jesus places so much stress on purpose throughout A Course in Miracles. Referring to the world as an hallucination, he tells us that \"one thing is sure; hallucinations serve a purpose, and when that purpose is no longer held they disappear. Therefore, the question never is whether you want them, but always, do you want the purpose they serve?\" (T-20.VIII.8:6-7). The dream thus serves the purpose of sustaining our existence as individuals and assuring us that we are not responsible for the separation from God."

    "output": "It is not unusual to come across this kind of thing in A Course in Miracles. The reason has to do with pedagogical (teaching) methodology. Jesus is making different points in different places in his teaching. In the statement from the manual that you quoted, he is speaking more generically about a teacher of God; whereas elsewhere he may be speaking about specific aspects of the process that unfolds once one has made this choice to see shared rather than separate interests.

What does a parent do who has a challenged child and feels overwhelmed by what they perceive as a tremendous burden?

    "output": "What helps to lighten the sense of being burdened with an overwhelming responsibility such as you describe, is to see the situation now as a classroom in which you can choose which teacher you will learn from. You can proceed with the ego as your teacher, in which case you would always be tempted to see you and your child in a victim-victimizer relationship, suffused with conflict and sacrifice. With Jesus as your teacher, however, you can see this as an opportunity to learn that the peace within you cannot be affected by this or any other external situation. That would be the ideal toward which you would strive, while not denying your present feelings to the contrary. The process involves bringing your perceptions and feelings of frustration, impatience, and victimization to his love, where you would know that you are loved and accepted as you are. His love would not judge you--love and condemnation are mutually exclusive--and so you would learn not to judge yourself or your child. It is not wrong to have these feelings, and it does not mean you are failing the Course. Your patience with yourself would reflect the caring gentleness of Jesus, who knows that ultimately the ego is nothing, and therefore we should not be upset by ego attacks. This attitude of gentleness could direct you to seek help with caring for your child so that perhaps you could have time away from the stress of the situation. There is no particular spiritual advantage to remaining in a stressful condition when relief is possible. It is just normal to seek relief from emotionally and physically draining situations, just as one would seek relief from the pain of a sprained ankle or a burned finger. Jesus encourages us, actually, to use such an approach as we work our way up the spiritual ladder (see T-2.IV.4-5). Following this gentle approach would help you avoid the temptation to \"fight yourself.\""

As a person living here in \"the dream,\" I see race and class as big elephants in the room. I am also experiencing sadness and fear.  : Can you give us some words of wisdom about responding to Hurricane Katrina, especially on the level of the world we believe is real? Initially, I joined in the blame game but then it occurred to me no one seemed to be accepting any responsibility, personally or officially. And then I remembered there is nothing outside of my mind and everything I see in someone else, I projected onto him or her because I wanted to get rid of it, so the other person would be guilty and I could be innocent. But everyone is doing the same thing--the Katrina \"victims,\" and all the officials from the bottom up. Perhaps the most loving thing we can do is to join with all our brothers and sisters in New Orleans and the Gulf Coast--the victims and the victimizers, the rescued and the rescuers, government officials and private citizens--in our right minds and embrace each other in unconditional love, remembering that we are all united in Christ. : With all the pain and suffering going on in the Gulf states hit by Katrina, how is it decided what \"dream\" or \"illusion\" we enter into. Some are born as kings and queens, others are living a life so horrible, such as those in Sudan, and now the hurricane victims. Is there an answer somewhere in the Course?",
    "output": "It can be very difficult to remember that there is another way of looking at the world, when we are so strongly self-identified as \"person[s] living here in 'the dream'\" and when our body's eyes have been and will continue to be confronted in the days and weeks ahead with such powerful images of devastation and death--in our newspapers and magazines, on our TV and computer screens and, for those of us who may live or have lived close to the area of impact, before our very eyes. And the ego's insistence that there is a hierarchy of destruction seems hard to argue with, as so many speak of the effects of this natural disaster as being of \"biblical proportions\" (the Course suggests a deeper meaning and source for that common expression to describe horrific cataclysmic events!). And so our collective reactions run the gamut from disbelief and horror to sadness and fear, as well as frustration and anger. That Jesus is fully aware of how we mislead ourselves, so long as our focus remains on the effects in the world without truly understanding their illusory cause in the mind, is apparent from his words: \"It is not easy to perceive the jest when all around you do your eyes behold its heavy consequences, but without their trifling cause. Without the cause do its effects seem serious and sad indeed. Yet they but follow. And it is their cause that follows nothing and is but a jest\" (T-27.VIII.8:4-7). But the only way to learn that there is another way of looking at the world is first to acknowledge that we are seeing the world--and this particular corner of the world along the Gulf Coast--the way we do now because we want to see it this way. For the way we are seeing it serves a very important function in the ego's plan to maintain the separation. These events and all the afterimages and aftershocks, with their multitude of geographical, economic, medical, political and societal reverberations, continue to convince us that the separation is real, and very, very serious. And just how does the ego build its case? The events seem so clearly to demonstrate that pain and suffering come from causes beyond our control, outside ourselves. And, despite the fact that the event itself was an \"act of nature\" that produced victims, much to the glee of many, it appears that there are those who may be responsible for failure to respond in ways that could have ameliorated the destructive and deadly consequences of the hurricane and its aftermath. In other words, clearly there are poor, helpless, homeless victims and careless, unfeeling, insensitive, and incompetent victimizers. Focusing on differences is the ego's lifeblood, so long as the differences make guilt real and assignment of blame a matter of utmost importance, whether it's because of differences in race or social class or political party, or whatever else works. And so we must begin by acknowledging that this is all very much what we want to see, for it serves not only the ego's purpose, but it serves our purpose. No doubt as more facts rise to the surface as the flood waters recede in the days and weeks ahead, the opportunity to project guilt and assign blame for all the apparent pain and loss and death will present itself over and over again. And the only question we have to ask ourselves is, do we really like how we feel as we look through the eyes of judgment, fear and attack? As the second questioner observes, we are all doing everything we can to demonstrate our innocence by pointing the finger of blame and guilt elsewhere. But if we could begin to recognize that deep sense of shame and guilt that we all collectively share for our unconscious beliefs about our betrayal of love, for deliberately choosing to see ourselves as homeless and bereft of our Father's Love, we would then be able to have a little more compassion for all the actors on the stage, each playing the part he or she has willingly chosen, no matter what role it may be in the unfolding tragedy. The Course, incidentally, offers no explanation for why we have chosen the specific lives and roles we find ourselves experiencing, other than that we continue to want to make differences between ourselves and others, no matter what the form, and hence, separation and guilt, real. Sometimes that may involve playing the victim, other times the victimizer, but those are the only real choices in the ego's dream (T-27.VII.14:4). To be concerned about why the differences exist in the world of form is to play right into the ego's game of making all those differences important and real. And the bigger mistake would be to believe that this apparent hierarchy at the level of form truly reflects differences in the degree of pain and guilt that each mind is experiencing. For everyone who believes this world is his home is in great pain, no matter what defenses he may employ to keep that recognition out of his awareness (W-pI.182.1-3). For pain and guilt never come from the world--the effect--but only from our interpretation of the world, which is determined by which teacher we have chosen to listen to in our minds--the ego or the Holy Spirit. And nothing in the world can release us from the pain and guilt in the mind--only forgiveness can do that. The pain in the mind associated with the guilt over our betrayal and attack on love is beyond comprehension, and we are all struggling in our own inadequate and nonfunctional ways to deal with it, never questioning its reality. And choosing to see ourselves as a victim, regardless of the form it may take, is simply one of the ways we attempt to atone for that imaginary guilt. And so, before we can embrace everyone in unconditional love, we will need to be able to learn to look on everyone, beginning with ourselves, with compassion for continuing to make the wrong choice, for still wanting to believe that destruction and homelessness and death are real, for believing that our salvation depends on seeing something or someone else as responsible for all the pain and suffering--that is, for needing to see the cause outside ourselves, outside our own minds. And so in the face of such apparent suffering and loss and need, what should our response be? Jesus asks only that we learn to forgive and everything else that is needed will follow. Our responsibility is not to change the world, but only to change the teacher who guides our perception of what our eyes behold in the world (T-21.in.1.7-12). There are of course many different ways in which we can express our support and concern for all those directly affected by the storm, whether they have lost family, their homes, their livelihood, their possessions. Jesus however is not concerned with the particular form of our response to the events we are witnessing, but the content with which we do whatever we may feel drawn to do in the world to offer help. What is essential to hold in mind is that, no matter what we do, if it comes from an ego perspective that continues in particular to see victims and, therefore, victimizing forces and folks, it will be an attack that keeps the thought of separation alive. But if we act from a right- minded perspective, whatever we think or say or do will have a healing effect, because we will have set aside our own need to be separate and special and \"innocent.\" Drawing on the beautiful imagery of the Course, it may be a helpful reminder of what our role is from Jesus' perspective, and where our safety lies, to close with some relevant lines from various sections of the book, holding in mind that our brother is everyone, and not only the apparent victims: \"Your home is built upon your brother's health, upon his happiness, his sinlessness, and everything his Father promised him. No secret promise you have made instead has shaken the Foundation of his home. The winds will blow upon it and the rain will beat against it, but with no effect. The world will wash away and yet this house will stand forever, for its strength lies not within itself alone. It is an ark of safety, resting on God's promise that His Son is safe forever in Himself\" (T-28.VII.7:1-5). \"I am in danger nowhere in the world. Your Son is safe wherever he may be, for You are there with him. He need but call upon Your Name, and he will recollect his safety and Your Love, for they are one ... No storms can come into the hallowed haven of our home. In God we are secure\" (W-pII.244.h; 1:1-2; 2:2-3). \"'I rest in God.' Completely undismayed, this thought will carry you through storms and strife, past misery and pain, past loss and death, and onward to the certainty of God. There is no suffering it cannot heal. There is no problem that it cannot solve ... You rest in God, and while the world is torn by winds of hate your rest remains completely undisturbed\" (W-pI.109.3:1-4; 4:2). \"There will always be this place of rest to which you can return. And you will be more aware of this quiet center of the storm than all its raging activity. This quiet center, in which you do nothing, will remain with you, giving you rest in the midst of every busy doing on which you are sent\" (T-18.VII.8:1-3)."

    "text_input": "Q #808: In answering #566, you stated that the separation is presented in A Course in Miracles as mythology that is meaningful within a framework of Western philosophy and religion. What curriculum is available within a framework of Eastern philosophy and religion? In other words, is there a correction to the Koran, Torah, Bhagavad Gita, etc.?",
    "output": "To clarify, the Torah (from Judaism) and the Koran (from Islam) are also part of the dualistic Western religious tradition, with a theology that sees God as the Creator of the entire physical universe, and sin and guilt real. However, unlike Christianity, Jesus is either not a spiritual figure (Judaism) or not the central spiritual figure (Islam) in these two other Western religions. Despite this difference, persons raised within one of these other Western religious traditions certainly may find the Course helpful in addressing limitations they may experience with their own religious training. If they also have a background in Western philosophy (e.g., Plato and neo- Platonic thought) and/or psychology (e.g., psychodynamic theory and process), the Course's principles may have even greater appeal. Within the highest teachings of Eastern spiritual and philosophical traditions (e.g., Advaita within Hinduism), there already exist many of the concepts and principles that the Course offers as an alternative, and a correction, to traditional Christianity's dualistic emphasis on sin and guilt and a punishing God. The idea that the world is a dream is a common Eastern theme. The observation that the realm of perception, with the dichotomy between perceiver and perceived (or subject and object), is illusory, and that reality is One, is also well-represented within Eastern traditions. In other words, although the most common practices of these religions by the majority of their adherents may represent an emphasis on form and ritual, and supplication and sacrifice (basic tenets of the ego's universal \"religion,\" according to the Course), their scriptures also contain a deeper and more profound perspective on the nature of reality for the genuine seeker. And teachers have arisen from within their communities (e.g., Shankara in Hinduism) across the centuries to provide corrections that have brought dedicated followers back to the deepest spiritual roots of their traditions. The wisdom of these traditions, like that of the Course itself, is ageless. But from the perspective of illusory, ego-based, linear time, the Western world is in the infancy of its awakening in comparison to the Eastern religions and philosophies. And yet the Course comes in a context that is especially suited to the needs of the Western world, which also allows it to offer some fresh new spiritual insights, building on its particularly Western intellectual tradition, that are not contained in any other of the world's spiritual teachings--such as an explanation of the mind's motivation to make up a world and continue dreaming, despite all the suffering and pain that seem to result. In the end, the good news is that we need not be concerned with anyone's spiritual path but our own, for there are thousands of genuine paths (M-1.4:1-2), as the Course points out, but we need only the one that will serve us best (T-18.VII.6:5). And if the Course is our path, it only makes sense to dedicate ourselves to understanding its principles of forgiveness and putting them into practice."

    "text_input": "Q #809: From the perspective of A Course in Miracles, what might a \"separated\" mind experience upon finally fulfilling the ego's promise--the \"death of the body\"? Since the mind is always active, always choosing, what does the ego then say to continue the illusion of its own reality? It can't really say, \"Oops, sorry buddy, guess we were wrong.\" Most of us, who to some degree must still think we are here, are not prepared for what the transition of \"not being here\" would present us with. And since those still believing in the illusion of guilt and separation will still be in the dream, how does the ego get itself out of that one, not to mention eventually persuading this mind that it would indeed be a great idea to go \"corporeal\" again? Also, does the separated mind still have the option to choose for the Holy Spirit during this supposed time between \"lives\"? And would learning, choosing the Holy Spirit and undoing the effects of the ego still progress during this time for students with willingness? A: What allows the ego to continue to maintain its smoke-and-mirrors illusions is the defense of repression or denial (e.g., T-11.II.3). Being the master of confusion and forgetfulness, the ego never lets us maintain any awareness of all its deceptions, so long as we still don't want to see through them. The ego, after all, is only a name for our own decision for self-deception and Self- denial. So long as we want to continue to fool ourselves about who we are, each seeming bodily death will have no more effect on our self-identity and our awareness of our ego machinations than any of the seeming events of the \"life\" of that body.",
    "output": "For \"between\" lives is not an interval of time when we are non-corporeal, since we are never in bodies. It is simply a brief instant when our mind is no longer consciously identifying with one particular ego identity and script, and is shifting our conscious identification to an already existing alternative victim script. There is really nothing linear about this process, although while we remain identified with time and space, we speak of it as if it were. All possible lives are simultaneous and in fact have already happened in that single unholy instant when we, as one Son, took the tiny mad idea of separation seriously. Since learning happens only in the mind, and has nothing to do with bodies, you are right, the possibility of choosing the Holy Spirit as our Teacher is always available to us, regardless of what aspect of the ego's myriad deceptions we happen to be identifying with in any one instant. For more on the nature of time, our seeming lives, and the choices available to us, A Vast Illusion: Time According to A Course in Miracles, would be helpful.

    "output": "The Course has to meet us where we are, and where we are is in a world that is very complex. But this is because our world has come from a very complex thought system, the thought system that dominates our minds. Therefore, if Jesus is going to be able to help us, the context of his teaching has to be this immense complexity of both our outer and inner worlds. That is what he means when he says, \"This course remains within the ego framework, where it is needed\" (C- in.3:1). Complexity is the name of the ego's game, he tells us in the text (T-15.IV.6:2). His teachings must address this complexity in order to undo it. Thus, when we start out with the Course, it can indeed appear to be hopelessly complex, but, again, that is because it is meeting us where we are. Its purpose, though, is to lead us out of that complexity to the \"simplicity of salvation\" (T-31.I), when we will all finally realize that \"what is false is false, and what is true has never changed\" (W-pII.10.1:1). That is the simple truth, hidden behind the vast complexity of both the ego thought system in our minds and the world that has come from it. #40 discusses the high intellectual level of the Course, and also that even though it is on a high level, everyone can find something in it that will help them become less guilty and fearful, and more kind and peaceful."

    "text_input": "Q #811: How would A Course in Miracles explain a negative intuitive/gut feeling I get when I meet a certain person? A new neighbor recently moved in and I get a strong negative feeling about this person--that he may be socially deviant and someone I need to be worried about. Clearly there are misperceptions here in that I am not seeing this person as a perfect child of God and that I am seeing myself as vulnerable. How would Jesus have me deal with this situation? What is this intuitive feeling? Is it just an extension of my ego?",
    "output": "In A Course in Miracles, Jesus teaches that the fundamental attack thought is the mind's decision to proclaim: \"I am a body.\" Identity with the body is thus established, along with guilt for the \"sin\" of having taken the thought of separation seriously. In order to preserve body identity and escape responsibility for the attack, the mind erases the memory of making the choice. It does so by projecting guilt and seeing attack outside itself. This is the true source of everyone's attack and fear of attack in the world, including your intuitive feeling: \"Because your attack thoughts will be projected, you will fear attack. And if you fear attack, you must believe that you are not invulnerable. Attack thoughts therefore make you vulnerable in your own mind, which is where the attack thoughts are\" (W-pI.26.2:3-5). The deep feeling of vulnerability is a reflection of the guilt for having chosen the ego. Fear thus becomes the force at work in the world, which is why it is filled with attacks ranging from the seemingly innocuous to the vicious. From fear comes the ego's vast arsenal of defenses spurred by guilt's battle cry \"killed or be killed\" (M-17.7:11). Therefore, like the rest of the animal kingdom, humans are trained to sense danger (sometimes with \"gut feelings\"), defend against it, and attack the perceived enemy. The important thing to remember, from the perspective of the Course's teaching, is that the source of all fear and vulnerability is guilt in the mind for choosing to believe the separation is real. The guilt is projected in many different forms of attack, some of which the world judges to be more deleterious than others. However, the attacker and the victim's fear have the same source in the mind. In content, they are both equally insane. Recognition of this sameness is a good place to start in dealing with those whose insanity sparks fear in us in a more obvious way. In the Course, Jesus teaches that the source of fear is not the potential harm of someone else's attack on the body, but the mind's choice for separation. However, although he tells us the \"mind cannot attack or be attacked\" (T-7.VIII.4:3), he also tells us thoughts are dangerous to bodies. (T-21.VIII.1). Therefore, it is wise to be careful in dealing with the world, and especially with those whose fear is expressed in physical attack upon others. Neither their fear, nor the harmful form it takes, diminishes their true Identity as a perfect sons of God, but it can make them dangerous bodies to be around: \"frightened people can be vicious\" (T-3.I.4:2). As long as any belief in the body is held, there is nothing wrong with being cautious when the threat of physical harm is perceived. This is no different from seeking medical help when the body is sick. We are not asked to deny our belief in the body, our fear, nor the potential for actual attack. What Jesus does ask us to do, is observe the feelings of vulnerability, fear, or defensiveness that arise, recognizing in them the mind's forgotten choice to identify with the thought of separation and the body, thereby denying the true Identity of God's Son; ours and the neighbor's. Recognition of fear's true source is an expression of the \"little willingness\" (T- 26.VII.10:1) that is required. It takes the blame off our neighbors for the source of our fear, and returns our attention to our own mind's need of healing. At least, then, we are at the root of the problem and can ask the Holy Spirit's help to make another choice. That is all that is required."

    "text_input": "Q #812: I have a question regarding the subject of \"conflict\" described in A Course in Miracles. The Course says that everything we are hiding must be looked upon and given to God before we can finally return to our true state of being. Is that the reason things seem to get worse for a lot of people when they start doing the workbook and studying the text? The Course also states that it is not meant to describe what is of God but what hinders us in seeing Him and us in our true state.  Could you advise anything on how to do the Course so that it might be easier for people to handle what comes up when they begin to get in touch with \"what they are hiding from God\"? From the postings you get, is there a tendency for people to have similar experiences when doing the Course, or is everyone different in what problems they describe when encountering their \"dark spots\"?",
    "output": "The issues you raise highlight the importance of having a relationship with Jesus or the Holy Spirit, and why that is stressed so much throughout the entire Course. One could not possibly go through the process of exposing and then letting go of one's ego without having an inner source of guidance, strength, and comfort to turn to. The words terror and fear come up in the Course far too often to be ignored. In one passage, Jesus tells us that the Presence of the Holy Spirit accompanies us always, and that if we were to accept His Presence, \"fear would be impossible\" but our continuing to choose to be separate from God blocks our awareness of that Presence: \"If you knew Who walks beside you on the way that you have chosen, fear would be impossible. You do not know because the journey into darkness has been long and cruel, and you have gone deep into it\" (T-18.III.3:2-3). In another passage, Jesus speaks about the inability of the body to take us beyond it to \"what lies underneath\"; yet, he says we can get there \"if you are willing to follow the Holy Spirit through seeming terror, trusting Him not to abandon you and leave you there. For it is not His purpose to frighten you, but only yours. You are severely tempted to abandon Him at the outside ring of fear, but He would lead you safely through and far beyond\" (T-18.IX.3:5-9). Thus, an essential part of our process is learning to trust in the presence of an internal Teacher -- either Jesus or the Holy Spirit--for then we would avoid the temptation to judge ourselves for our decision to separate from Love and then make it appear as if it is someone else's fault. Although it does not have to be this way, for practically all of us, things get worse before they get better in the process of undoing our egos. Jesus alludes to this several times (see for example, T-9.VII.4:5-7; T-18.III.2:1). We have built layer upon layer of defenses to protect ourselves from the contents in our minds--what we believe would totally overwhelm us, if not destroy us, if we ever allowed ourselves to face it. Even the first step of recognizing our defenses as defenses is painful, for more than likely we did not even know that we were defending ourselves against massive internal calamity. Thus, understanding the thought system of the ego and its correction through the Holy Spirit's thought system will help enormously as we go through this, for then we will at least have a general idea of what the undoing process is all about--why we undertake it and where it is heading. What is also important to keep in mind as one proceeds is that we are undoing something that never really happened, although it does not seem that way. The Atonement principle, after all, is the acceptance of the fact that the separation from God is an illusion. Recalling this frequently will help one avoid the common pitfall of taking the process too seriously and trying too hard to get through it, forgetting that time as well is illusory. We are all one mind, and so we all share the same basic thought system of sin, guilt, and fear; but the specific expressions of that vary from person to person, as do the expressions of forgiveness that undo that thought system. In that sense, each person's process is different, which means we must take care not to compare ourselves with anyone else. We have no way of knowing where we or anyone else is on their Atonement path, so we ought not make comparisons of that nature. Finally, some people have found it helpful to have their favorite reassuring passages close at hand when things get rough--passages that remind them that they are not alone and that \"the outcome is as certain as God\" (T-2.III.3:10; T-4.II.5:8). Turning to a kind friend, teacher, or therapist can be an important source of help as well."

    "text_input": "Q #813: The idea of love's symbols being attacked in our world really intrigues me and is something that I am trying to understand better and put into everyday practical language. Can you tell me if this assessment is correct? People are very competitive and enjoy finding people to compete against and feel better than. When loving people like Jesus or any of us coming from a loving space come along who teach unity and are not competitive with these people, these people feel threatened because they are seeing something that goes against everything they believe in. Are you saying that people's egos are threatened by people who are not threatened by them or are they threatened by self-love? What does the ego see exactly about loving symbols that it wants to attack them? It seems perplexing to me that someone would feel threatened by someone who is being kind more than someone being competitive. Can you help me understand this?",
    "output": "Jesus answers your question in the following way: \"An insane learner learns strange lessons. What you must recognize is that when you do not share a thought system, you are weakening it. Those who believe in it therefore perceive this as an attack on them. This is because everyone identifies himself with his thought system, and every thought system centers on what you believe you are. If the center of the thought system is true, only truth extends from it. But if a lie is at its center, only deception proceeds from it\" (T-6.V- B.1:6-11; italics added). In other words, my false identity as a separate, individual self is threatened by you when you represent the thought that separation and differences are unreal, which is what is always behind any genuine, right-minded symbol of unity, love and forgiveness. Now, if I am willing to consider the possibility that our interests are shared rather than separate--the latter being at the root of all the ego's competitiveness--then I may be able to accept at least a tentative inner shift of teachers from the ego to the Holy Spirit (not that I would necessarily represent such a shift to myself with such symbols). And in that moment I would be able to experience the love that is being offered through you without feeling threatened. However, when I do feel threatened, it is not you who are threatening, nor is it my self-love, unless by self-love you mean the boundless, unlimited, universal love that we all share. For that is the love that says that neither of us exists as a separate individual, and that again is what is so threatening. However, even if I remain entrenched in my wrong mind and tightly defended against the love being reflected in your mind, going so far as to reject it and attack you in some way to \"protect\" myself, so long as you remain identified with the Holy Spirit in your right mind, you will not experience this reaction as an attack, but only as a call for love. If you experience it as attack, which would not be an unexpected reaction for most of us who are still learning our lessons of forgiveness because guilt is still real in our minds, you too would have become wrong-minded and your reaction would be your call for help as well. And so you would simply want to turn once again to your inner Teacher for help in seeing yourself differently before you could again become a reminder to me that the same choice is available to both of us. It may be helpful to recognize that this ego dynamic of attacking love operates within our own mind, and we may direct it against ourselves after we have chosen to listen to the Holy Spirit and see ourselves as He does, rather than accept the ego's puny judgment of ourselves. If we attack ourselves for identifying with the Holy Spirit, it can not be so surprising that others' egos react in the same way. This self-attack is clearly described a little later in the text of A Course in Miracles, when Jesus observes: \"You, then, have two conflicting evaluations of yourself in your mind, and they cannot both be true. You do not yet realize how completely different these evaluations are, because you do not understand how lofty the Holy Spirit's perception of you really is. He is not deceived by anything you do, because He never forgets what you are. The ego is deceived by everything you do, especially when you respond to the Holy Spirit, because at such times its confusion increases. The ego is, therefore, particularly likely to attack you when you react lovingly, because it has evaluated you as unloving and you are going against its judgment. The ego will attack your motives as soon as they become clearly out of accord with its perception of you. This is when it will shift abruptly from suspiciousness to viciousness, since its uncertainty is increased. Yet it is surely pointless to attack in return. What can this mean except that you are agreeing with the ego's evaluation of what you are?\" (T-9.VII.4; italics added). Whether the seeming attack then comes from within or without, if we react defensively we are making the same mistake. And we are as identified with the ego as our competitive brother is. And so, in Jesus' words from the text, \"You who are not at war must look for brothers and recognize all whom you see as brothers, because only equals are at peace. Because God's equal Sons have everything, they cannot compete. Yet if they perceive any of their brothers as anything other than their perfect equals, the idea of competition has entered their minds. Do not underestimate your need to be vigilant against this idea, because all your conflicts come from it. It is the belief that conflicting interests are possible, and therefore you have accepted the impossible as true. Is that different from saying you perceive yourself as unreal?\" (T-7.III.3:2-7). And so before we can accept that we are all the one, guiltless Son of our Father, equally sharing in the unity of His Love, and therefore could not possibly be in competition with each other, we must first acknowledge that, as egos, we are really all the same. For that alone is what opens the door to forgiveness and true healing of the guilt within our minds. Q#814: The body/brain cannot choose the Holy Spirit or the ego; it can only bear witness to the choice of the decision maker in the mind. Jesus' Course appears on the level of the illusion, and seems to be mentally processed within the illusion by a brain. A Course in Miracles exhorts students reading it to choose again, yet the Course states throughout that choice on the level of the illusion is impossible! Is the Course asking the mind, of which the student is unaware by the Course's own admission, to choose again? What a riddle! A: It is helpful to be clear that the reason the body/brain cannot choose the Holy Spirit or the ego is because everything happens in the mind and nothing happens in the brain, no matter how it may seem, for the brain and the body are only shadows or projections of thoughts of separation in the mind. We are the mind, falsely identifying with its unreal thoughts, believing we are the projections of those thoughts rather than the thinker of those thoughts. We are the decision maker, choosing to accept a very limited false identity rather than to acknowledge all the seeming power of our mind to miscreate. While it is true that all choice is illusion, while we continue to believe we have a choice to see ourselves as separate from God, Jesus works within the illusion of our misbeliefs to help us make a different choice. So even the split mind and the decision maker are illusory, but the power of our belief has made them real in our experience. There is certainly a very real sense in which we seem to operate in the world as if we were mindless, for we are truly unaware of the power of our mind to have chosen to make the world and this physical self real. But everything we seem to think and do as a body is really a result of the exercise of the power of the mind to choose--and it's a choice for the ego, over and over and over again. We are always experiencing ourselves as mind, for nothing is happening in the brain, but we simply have chosen not to recognize that the mind does not depend on the brain, the brain depends on the mind. And so, since we are in that sense aware of our mind through all of the thoughts we experience, it is perhaps more accurate to say that we are unaware of the real power of the mind rather than to say that we are unaware of the mind. We use its power of choice to make that same blind choice for the ego repeatedly, all the while disguising the uniform content of that choice in a myriad of seemingly different forms. And so, although we may believe Jesus is addressing us as the self in the world we think we are, he is always and only addressing us as a mind that seems to have a choice. And that choice is only between the hurtful illusion of the ego and the helpful illusion of the Holy Spirit. And so, while we may experience ourselves making the choice from within the world, Jesus knows it is only ever our mind, outside of time and space, that is making the choice. And so, once we understand that, the seeming riddle is easily solved. For further discussions of related issues on the mind and the decision maker, see Questions #663, #713, and #715."

I love the words but always come away with \"so what in the hell am I supposed to do?\" ii) With the illusory nature of this world how is one to function? I post the quote \"you are asked to act as if you had no ego.\" But to live a life free of judgment seems to be a blissninny way to go.",
    "output": "The agitation you experience when you read the Course is probably not coming from not understanding what it is saying, but from understanding. You are not alone in feeling agitated by its message, and with good reason. The goal of the Course is the undoing of the ego's thought system, which ultimately means undoing all belief in the world, the body, and separation. It is not an easy message for the ego to hear, considering its investment in keeping us rooted in the world, its treasured home. The first thing to do is not to try not to be agitated, but to understand where the agitation is coming from: a choice in the mind to believe the separation is real, and resistance to learning a thought system that teaches that it is not. In this regard, Jesus offers us clear advice: \"Do not fight yourself\" (T-30.I.1:7). What we are supposed to do is follow his instructions to look calmly at the ego in operation without fear, and without judgment: \"No one can escape from illusions unless he looks at them, for not looking is the way they are protected. There is no need to shrink from illusions, for they cannot be dangerous. We are ready to look more closely at the ego's thought system because together we have the lamp that will dispel it, and since you realize you do not want it, you must be ready. Let us be very calm in doing this, for we are merely looking honestly for truth\" (T-11.V.1:1-4). Since the Introduction to the text tells us our goal in studying this course is to remove \" ... the blocks to the awareness of love's presence\" (T-in.1:7), it is reasonable to conclude that the blocks must be seen before they can be removed. That is why we are asked to look for them: \"Your task is not to seek for love, but merely to seek and find all of the barriers within yourself that you have built against it. It is not necessary to seek for what is true, but it is necessary to seek for what is false\" (T-16.IV.6:1-2). That is what we are supposed to do. The instruction to look is repeated frequently in the Course, because it is the correction for the ego's strategy of defending its thought system by keeping its origin (the mind), its goal (mindlessness), and its effects (pain) hidden. When we find the blocks (e.g., any judgment, all forms of specialness), we then are asked not to be deceived by their disguises, but to see in them the mind's choice to collude with the ego's scheme to keep the world real. To no longer identify with the ego's judgment is the ultimate goal of the Course. That is how we will eventually live \"as if we had no ego.\" Daily practice of the Course will lead us there, but it is not yet fully accomplished. We can easily avoid the blissninny approach through vigilant observation of the many judgments that flood into awareness during the course of the day. The ones we catch are enough to keep us humble, not to mention those we miss. Since blissninny's mother is denial, not denying our judgments and feelings keeps us focused and headed in the right direction. The Holy Spirit is here to tell us there is another way of looking at everything in our lives. As we are told in the introduction to the workbook: \"The purpose of the workbook is to train your mind in a systematic way to a different perception of everyone and everything in the world\" (W-in.4:1). This \"different perception\" is not the ego's. So, as we develop this new way of thinking and learn to live under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, we \"live as if we had no ego.\" It does not mean the ego disappears, nor that it is denied. It means that when the ego makes an appearance, it does not have to be given the best seat in the house. When it is recognized, and its secret agenda is exposed, it no longer carries the weight it previously did. Even the simple fact of knowing there is another Guest to Whom we can turn diminishes the ego's hold. Yes, in truth the world is an illusion, but as long as we believe it is real we continue to function normally. The only difference is we learn to interpret everything in the light of the Course's teaching of forgiveness, and its goal of removing the blocks to love's awareness. When resistance in the form of agitation presents itself, it may be helpful to remember only a \"little willingness\" is required, and it \"need not be perfect, because His [Holy Spirit's] is. If you will merely offer Him a little place, He will lighten it so much that you will gladly let it be increased. And by this increase, you will begin to remember creation\" (T- 11.II.6:6-8)."

    "text_input": "Q #816: If it's true that we are all one then why is not Jesus' return to God ours as well?",
    "output": "It is. We are with him at home in God. The only difference between Jesus (as well as others who have awakened) and the rest of us is that he is aware only of his oneness with God's Love. We have chosen to forget it, dream of separation, and only catch a glimpse of love's reflection when we are willing to forget the dream for an instant. Knowing we perceive him as different from us, Jesus explains the seeming difference in the first chapter of the text: \"There is nothing about me that you cannot attain. I have nothing that does not come from God. The difference between us now is that I have nothing else. This leaves me in a state which is only potential in you\" (T-1.II.3:10-13). What we have, that he does not, are all our illusions of specialness that keep us separate from him, from one another, and from our Selves. By choosing the \"tiny, mad idea\" (T-27.VIII.6:2) of separation, we keep awareness of our oneness with God blocked. This insane thought did not truly shatter our oneness; it is only our choosing it that makes it real in our experience: \"The tiny instant you would keep and make eternal, passed away in Heaven too soon for anything to notice it had come ... Yet in each unforgiving act or thought, in every judgment and in all belief in sin, is that one instant still called back, as if it could be made again in time. You keep an ancient memory [the thought of separation] before your eyes. And he who lives in memories alone is unaware of where he is\" (T-26.V.5:1,5-6). We do not know where we are; Jesus knows where he is. We dream of being bodies in a world of form, which literally takes us out of our minds. Our hope lies in the fact that we cannot completely obliterate all memory of the truth of our oneness from our minds. This is witnessed to by the very fact of having Jesus come to us in the form of A Course in Miracles to awaken us from the nightmare of exile. His message of forgiveness reflects the part of our minds that remembers oneness. The practice of forgiveness that he teaches gently wakens us by leading us back to the mind; the source of every experience. Each step in forgiveness strengthens our identity with Jesus and weakens identity with the body. Eventually, his identity and his experience will become ours because we will have accepted what was always there."

    "text_input": "Q #817: I have read your response to #317, which relates to physical disease, and understand that A Course in Miracles teaches that I need to question the idea that anything outside myself can disturb my peace, including illness. Can you please explain to me why the Course uses the following phrase when dealing with physical illness: \"Behold me brother, at your hand I die\" (T- 27.I.4:6). Is the word \"brother\" being used figuratively? Is the Course suggesting that we address a virus thus?",
    "output": "Although you could read this line you quote from \"The Picture of Crucifixion\" to refer to viruses, in most passages, including this section, when Jesus speaks of our brothers, he is speaking of our relationships with others whom we perceive to be human beings like ourselves. And behind every illness and disease--in fact, behind all our pain and suffering, no matter what the perceived immediate cause in the world--can be found an accusation that one of our brothers or sisters is somehow to blame. Sometimes the accusation is explicit: e.g., \"You gave me your cold.\" Or \"If you hadn't made me work so hard, I wouldn't have gotten so stressed and worn out and caught this flu bug.\" Sometimes the accusation is less direct: e.g., \"Both my mother and my grandmother died of breast cancer, so I guess it was only a matter of time before I was going to be diagnosed with it myself.\" Or \"I'm just sure my lung disease is the result of all that secondary smoke I was exposed to all those years I worked in that small, crowded office.\" And sometimes the accusation can be very subtle: e.g., \"I know I just didn't have all the opportunities for advancement that my friends had, with my parents not financially well off. And so I ended up with less education and a lower paying job. As a result, I just could not afford the kind of preventative medical care that could have helped me maintain better health.\" The point of the answer to Question #317 you refer to is that, at the level of content in the mind, it does not matter what form the victimizer seems to take in the world, whether it's another person, a virus, an accident, a catastrophic meteorological or geological event, or anything else. The purpose is always to find someone or something outside myself that I can point a finger at and hold responsible for my suffering and pain, rather than to look within my own mind at the real cause--my decision for separation and attack. The purpose, in other words, is always, whatever the seeming expression of suffering in my body, to demonstrate my innocence by accusing my brother of the sin and attack I secretly accuse myself of. By the way, when Jesus speaks in \"The Picture of Crucifixion\" of our use of our brother to prove our innocence, he is not addressing us as human beings, nor is he referring to our brothers as the bodies we perceive. Perceiving ourselves and our brothers as bodies is central to the ego's plan to demonstrate our victimhood (e.g., T-21.VIII.1:1-2). Jesus is always addressing us as minds, albeit minds who happen to believe we are the bodies we seem to inhabit. That he is also regarding our brother as a mind and not a body is apparent from his observation later in the text: \"Like you, your brother thinks he is a dream. Share not in his illusion of himself, for your Identity depends on his reality. Think, rather, of him as a mind in which illusions still persist, but as a mind which brother is to you. He is not brother made by what he dreams, nor is his body, 'hero' of the dream, your brother. It is his reality that is your brother, as is yours to him. Your mind and his are joined in brotherhood. His body and his dreams but seem to make a little gap, where yours have joined with his\" (T-28.IV.3; italics added). And so, in the end, we will come to realize that sickness is really a condition of guilt in the mind--only its nonsubstantial shadow seems to be expressed in the body (T-28.II.11:7). From this realization, it follows that we are never the victim of anyone else's actions, but only of our own thoughts."

The result is a severe constriction making swallowing very difficult. I have seen questions asked about praying and relieving or eliminating malignancies. My question is, what prayers should I use to relieve and remove the growth? My wife will help me pray.",
    "output": "First of all, you want to continue to seek out and follow whatever medical advice and treatment is available to help you with your condition. It is important to be clear that it is never an either-or proposition between medical interventions and A Course in Miracles. And then you should say whatever prayers bring you comfort and reassure you that it is not God's Will that you suffer or experience pain or fear, using words that are personally meaningful to you and your wife. The specific words are not so important as the decision you make to allow your mind to be joined with your wife's in a shared purpose of healing. The Course's focus is on healing the thoughts of unforgiveness we are holding against ourselves in our minds and not on changing the symptoms in our bodies, which it considers to be the effects of those thoughts. Still, there is nothing wrong with asking for help with physical conditions and Jesus recognizes that for most of us, still identified with our bodies, that will continue to be our focus of concern (S-1.II.2). Perhaps you would be willing to consider your symptoms as the external expression of a thought of illness--the ego, to be specific--in your mind. Then you can bring the thoughts of fear and pain in your mind to Jesus or the Holy Spirit or God, or whatever loving presence you find most comforting. The value in focusing in your prayers on any thoughts of pain or guilt or fear in your mind, as well as your bodily concerns, is that then you are including, from the Course's perspective, the underlying cause of the suffering and pain, as well as the effects--the physical symptoms. There are many passages in the Course that you may find of help and comfort as you deal with the ramifications of your diagnosis. One in particular, which recognizes the process that we all must go through as we commit ourselves to putting the Course's principles of forgiveness into practice, is Lesson 284, \"I can elect to change all thoughts that hurt.\" \"Loss is not loss when properly perceived. Pain is impossible. There is no grief with any cause at all. And suffering of any kind is nothing but a dream. This is the truth, at first to be but said and then repeated many times; and next to be accepted as but partly true, with many reservations. Then to be considered seriously more and more, and finally accepted as the truth. I can elect to change all thoughts that hurt. And I would go beyond these words today, and past all reservations, and arrive at full acceptance of the truth in them\" (W-p.II.284.1; italics added). These words are not meant to be used to deny or suppress whatever you may be experiencing in your body, but rather to offer the hope that, as a result of acknowledging the pain and the fear and their deeper source in the mind, the real potential for healing the underlying thoughts becomes possible. There are a number of questions, as you note, addressing issues of prayer and healing. Two that may be particularly relevant to your concerns include Questions #149 and #215."

    "text_input": "Q #819: A question on the metaphysics of A Course in Miracles, please. My sense of the teachings is that 1) We are \"at home in God dreaming of exile ... \" (or continuing to review and identify with the dream that lasted but a moment and was over long ago), and that 2) God does not know \"about\" this dream, since it is by definition unreal. My question is whether God knows even that there was a dream, and that we--in Heaven and at home with Him-- continue to engage (review and identify) with that dream, though He does not know all the sin-guilt-fear machinations of the dream itself? The image I keep getting is that we are sort of \"missing-in- action\" if you will, at home in Heaven, but not fully there--asleep. Does God know us as asleep, but not what we dream while asleep? Or are \"we\" a sleeping part of a larger Sonship, the other part of which is ''fully present\" in the song of prayer with God. A: There is no dream; the Son never fell asleep. That expresses the absolute non-dualism of the Course, a non-dualism that allows no compromise. Heaven (reality) is \"an awareness of perfect Oneness, and the knowledge that there is nothing else; nothing outside this Oneness, and nothing else within\" (T-18.VI.1:6). If even part of the Sonship were asleep, perfect Oneness would no longer be perfect Oneness; imperfection would coexist with Perfection, and limitation with Wholeness. From the Course's point of view, this is impossible. So, as humbling and as baffling as it is to us, the Son as not eternally sharing the Perfection of His Father and Source is a complete impossibility. To say, therefore, that God knows \"some part of the Sonship to be 'asleep'\" is to give reality to a dualistic state. That would be inconsistent with the strict non- dualism of A Course in Miracles.",

    "text_input": "Q #820: The first miracle principle in A Course in Miracles is that \"there is no order of difficulty in Miracles.\" Does that not mean, if I did the workbook \"properly,\" I would be able to be \"enlightened\" with each and every exercise I am doing in the Course (so 365 chances to reach God)? Do they not mean all the same (i.e. point at the same unspeakable \"thing\" that the Course can but lead us to but never explicitly say)? The lessons 70-75 seem quite crucial to me, what else is there to learn after \"the light has come\" and I can \"celebrate the ending of the long dream  of disaster\"? Once I have forgiven the world completely (albeit theoretically), does it not disappear and with God's vision in me ... why is this passage not at the end of the workbook?",
    "output": "If you did just one lesson perfectly, you would have completed the goal of the Course. However, the reason there are 31 chapters and 365 lessons is summed up simply in one of the lessons: \"To say these words [of any lesson] is nothing. But to mean these words is everything. If you could but mean them for just an instant, there would be no further sorrow possible for you in any form; in any place or time. Heaven would be completely given back to full awareness, memory of God entirely restored, the resurrection of all creation fully recognized\" (W-pI.185.1:1-4). If we have not had the experienced described in this passage, we may conclude that we have not meant these words completely, not even for an instant. Commitment is still weak, resistance is strong, and willingness wavers. In other words, we are afraid of awakening to the truth. And so we have at least 365 thousand opportunities to learn to accept that we are home in God. On the journey, there are glimpses of the light that has come, and if the light were the only thing we wanted, yes, it would be enough. However, attraction to guilt and attachment to specialness drop a veil to obscure the light, lest it remain to replace the individual autonomy that is still cherished. That is why there are lessons after 70-75, and why the workbook ends by telling us we've only just begun: \"This course is a beginning, not an end\" (W-ep.1:1). Forgiving the world theoretically does not accomplish the Course's goal of removing the blocks to love's awareness (T-in.1:7). The world must actually be forgiven, which means not seeing in it the cause of anything that is experienced in the dream of separation. And you are correct; in this there is no hierarchy. Thus, we are taught in the Course to \"question every value that you hold. Not one can be kept hidden and obscure but it will jeopardize your learning\" (T-24.in.2:1- 2; italics added). The values and beliefs that sustain the ego thought system are, for the most part, hidden under layers of denial. It therefore takes time, lessons, starts and stops, to bring them to the light. The process is gradual and gentle because fear and resistance are great: \"It is difficult for the untrained mind to believe that what it seems to picture is not there. This idea can be quite disturbing, and may meet with active resistance in any number of forms\" (W-pI.9.2:1-2). A brief review of how real the world, the body, and the drama of life seem to be reveals the intensity of this resistance. That is why there is still work to be done, forgiveness lessons to be learned. The workbook is done \"properly\" by following the instructions, which simply tell us to just do the lessons (W-in.9). We are told only willingness is necessary. Most likely that is because Jesus knows we will do them \"badly,\" and he assures us that our imperfection is not a problem: \"It is [the Holy Spirit's] task to atone for your unwillingness by His perfect faith, and it is His faith you share with Him there. Out of your recognition of your unwillingness for your release, His perfect willingness is given you\" (T-16.VI.12:4-5). Thus, each sincere application of the principles of forgiveness in our relationships, however imperfect it may be, brings us closer to the ending of the dream. Our concern in practicing the Course, therefore, is to be vigilant for every spot of darkness (judgments) and every illusion we choose to make real, that they may be questioned and found wanting. Until we are convinced none of them will meet our real need to accept the truth about ourselves instead of the ego's lies, we need the lessons of the workbook and the many pages of the text to turn to for guidance, instruction, and comfort."

    "text_input": "Q #821: I am at a place in life in which I am experiencing overwhelming fear. My husband and I have been married for a few years and together for nine. Over time, the outward dramas have lessened and now that there is a certain sense of outward stability in my marriage, I seem to be assailed on all sides by fears: is this situation one in which I can grow? Am I denying part of myself by staying in this relationship? Do I feel like I would be better off alone, with someone else, or with a woman? All these questions come to mind. More than anything, it seems that I have reached a place where I am now forced to take responsibility for my own thoughts--that I am encountering my shadow side. I want to run. Is there anything in A Course in Miracles that might speak to this level of fear and specific steps to take to deal with it? A: While we remain closely identified with the ego, it can feel as if we are being forced to take responsibility for our thoughts, as you describe. True, the Course is encouraging us to accept this responsibility as central to progressing on our path of forgiveness. But if there is any sense of coercion, the ego has joined the process in an attempt to subvert and derail it. And that feeling of coercion itself only adds to the anxiety and the fear. So the first step in addressing the fear is to recognize and accept that any sense of pressure is coming only from yourself. And if the overwhelming fear persists, Jesus gently advises, \"Do not fight yourself\" (T-30.I.1:7). It is okay to wait until you are ready. The ego revels in the thought that there is something terrible within that we must force ourselves to examine. For that reinforces the belief that the ego--and the separation--are real. And so, for this reason, when we are ready to look within, Jesus invites us to look with him, for he does not share our horrible evaluation of ourselves and he certainly does not take the ego seriously. One of his clearest invitations to us, which also acknowledges our fear, is found at the beginning of \"The 'Dynamics' of the Ego,\" in which he reminds us that this is something we do together:",
    "output": "\"No one can escape from illusions unless he looks at them, for not looking is the way they are protected. There is no need to shrink from illusions, for they cannot be dangerous. We are ready to look more closely at the ego's thought system because together we have the lamp that will dispel it, and since you realize you do not want it, you must be ready. Let us be very calm in doing this, for we are merely looking honestly for truth. The 'dynamics' of the ego will be our lesson for a while, for we must look first at this to see beyond it, since you have made it real. We will undo this error quietly together, and then look beyond it to truth\" (T-11.V.1). You are wise to recognize that the real issue of your fear involves examining your own thoughts, but you also acknowledge having thoughts of running away from your relationship with your husband. Now these thoughts are not surprising if, as you say, you are experiencing less drama and conflict in your external life, which may very well reflect an inner shift away from the ego and towards the peace within that Jesus is offering. And you can be sure the ego is not going to take this change of allegiance lying down. External drama and conflict conveniently serve the ego's purpose of keeping our focus outward and away from the mind, where the only real hope of finding lasting peace lies. If the ego begins to sense that our present relationship is no longer serving its purpose, it will counsel us to pull up stakes and go in search of someone or something else--anything other than remaining in peace and beginning to look within. Two passages from the text describe the ambivalence we can experience around this dual process of moving towards the light while at the same time beginning to use that light to look more deeply and eventually beyond the darkness of the ego. The fear that is aroused by approaching the light, as well as the process of looking together with Jesus at the darkness, are aptly described in the following: \"As the light comes nearer you will rush to darkness, shrinking from the truth, sometimes retreating to the lesser forms of fear, and sometimes to stark terror. But you will advance, because your goal is the advance from fear to truth. The goal you accepted is the goal of knowledge, for which you signified your willingness. Fear seems to live in darkness, and when you are afraid you have stepped back. Let us then join quickly in an instant of light, and it will be enough to remind you that your goal is light\" (T-18.III.2). And the fear that is associated with uncovering the ego's layers of sin and guilt in the mind, as well as the process of recognizing its unreality, is powerfully described in the following: \"The closer you come to the foundation of the ego's thought system, the darker and more obscure becomes the way. Yet even the little spark in your mind is enough to lighten it. Bring this light fearlessly with you, and bravely hold it up to the foundation of the ego's thought system. Be willing to judge it with perfect honesty. Open the dark cornerstone of terror on which it rests, and bring it out into the light. There you will see that it rested on meaninglessness, and that everything of which you have been afraid was based on nothing\" (T-11.in.3:5-10). Additional readings from the text that may help you get a clearer picture of what the fear is all about and what the process of releasing that fear involves, in the context of our relationship with our brother, joined with Jesus, include \"Light in the Dream\" (T-18.III) and \"The Fear to Look Within\" (T-21.IV)."

I am having enormous difficulty seeing these events in other than worldly terms. How do I need to think about this special relationship in order to get past the considerable pain this is causing me.",
    "output": "A situation such as you describe can only be experienced as heart-rending and painful while we remain at the level of the world in thinking about it. For the ego-directed mind can only think in terms of victims and victimizers, and those roles can seem all too clearly defined and assigned in our minds as we continue to listen to the ego. But then that is exactly what we all would have agreed to do as we would come together to play out this particular script. And all includes parents, grandparents, and child, as well as anyone else caught up in the tugging drama. Once we have chosen to see ourselves and others as bodies--which is inevitable once we find ourselves in the world--the game of assigning blame and swapping guilt must be set into motion. And in order for the game to work, we all must feel, each from our own perspective, that we have been or are being unfairly treated, which then justifies our thoughts of attack in return. This hidden agreement to be victimized, which lies behind all our dealings with everyone else, is explicitly described in A Course in Miracles in \"The Secret Vows\" (T-28.VI), where Jesus explains the role of the body in this self-deception: \"The body represents the gap between the little bit of mind you call your own and all the rest of what is really yours. You hate it, yet you think it is your self, and that, without it, would your self be lost. This is the secret vow that you have made with every brother who would walk apart. This is the secret oath you take again, whenever you perceive yourself attacked. No one can suffer if he does not see himself attacked, and losing by attack. Unstated and unheard in consciousness is every pledge to sickness. Yet it is a promise to another to be hurt by him, and to attack him in return\" (T-28.VI.4; italics added). It seems crazy when stated so clearly and directly, yet this is what we are all unconsciously engaging in all the time. And why would we accept such an insane arrangement with all our brothers and sisters? To understand the motivation for this insanity, we need to recognize that the real source of the pain we experience in such situations in the world comes from the belief we hold in our mind that we are an ungrateful Child who has lost our love and innocence by turning away from our eternal Father. But such a self-accusation is too painful to hold for long in our awareness and so we have made a world that can disguise the \"truth\" of our attack on God so that we can see the guilt outside ourselves. The form of the projected attack will vary across circumstances, but in situations such as yours, it will seem that a child--who symbolizes our lost love and innocence--is being taken away from us, it is clearly not our fault, and that is the cause of our pain. And yet everyone caught up in the drama feels somehow similarly victimized and justified therefore in their thinking and acting. This recognition actually holds the key to our own escape from pain. For when we can begin to see that everyone is really the same, ensnared in the same deceptions of the ego--looking to project their own painful guilt over seeing themselves as loveless, believing that the special love relationship requires that bodies be together (T- 15.VII.8:2)--we may then be able to begin to release the judgments we are holding against the others, which are keeping us separate from them in our mind, which is the real source of the pain. If we could know and accept that the love we want is already present within us, no seeming loss on the outside could have any effect on us. It is important to emphasize that everything we have been discussing here refers only to the level of thought or content, and has no specific implications for what actions you are taking. In other words, it is possible to continue with the legal proceedings you have initiated without it being an attack on your grandson's mother. The proceedings can be a classroom in which you have the opportunity to observe how strong your desire to project your own guilt onto your ex-daughter- in-law may continue to be. And in those moments when you are in your right mind, you will know that it is possible to continue to take legal action without condemning or attacking her for her own need to project guilt and to attack in seeming self-defense, and you will feel nothing but love for everyone who is involved in the court battle, for you will be above the battleground. \"Those with the strength of God in their awareness could never think of battle. What could they gain but loss of their perfection? For everything fought for on the battleground is of the body; something it seems to offer or to own. No one who knows that he has everything could seek for limitation, nor could he value the body's offerings. The senselessness of conquest is quite apparent from the quiet sphere above the battleground. What can conflict with everything? And what is there that offers less, yet could be wanted more? Who with the Love of God upholding him could find the choice of miracles or murder hard to make?\" (T-23.IV.9)"

    "text_input": "Q #824: How does Course material deal with programming or treating for positive results?",
    "output": "The mind training that the Course teaches is not the same as the use of affirmations, or replacing negative thoughts with positive ones to achieve positive results. A Course in Miracles teaches that we must look at the negative, the darkness of the ego, with the Holy Spirit's light to dispel it: \"No one can escape from illusions unless he looks at them, for not looking is the way they are protected. There is no need to shrink from illusions, for they cannot be dangerous. We are ready to look more closely at the ego's thought system because together we have the lamp that will dispel it ... \" (T-11.V.1:1-3). Looking means recognizing the mind's choice for the ego and the purpose it serves. It is this recognition of responsibility for a purposive choice in the mind that distinguishes the Course's teaching. It is not aimed at improving our experience in the dream with positive thinking for positive results. The goal of the Course is to lead us out of the dream entirely by undoing the thought of separation. Changing thoughts within the ego's thought system will not lead to this awakening. Programming for positive results without recognition of the active choice for the ego in the mind leads to further suppressing the guilt that gave rise to the negative thoughts in the first place. It supports the belief that the body is real and that happiness can be found in the world with the right programming. While it is true that it may seem more pleasant to have positive results rather than negative ones, the best the ego has to offer will not bring release from the devastating effects of believing separation from God has been accomplished. In case we are tempted to minimize the effect of choosing the world, Jesus spells it out for us: \"The sense of threat the world encourages is so much deeper, and so far beyond the frenzy and intensity of which you can conceive, that you have no idea of all the devastation it has wrought\" (W-pI.153.4:3). Training the body's \"thoughts\" to avoid pain and conflict works as temporary relief. It will not heal the real source of the problem, which is the mind's mistaken choice to believe the ego and identify with the body. This choice produces guilt, which is then projected into the world in a multitude of forms, none of which is truly positive. The correction is to choose the Holy Spirit's curriculum of forgiveness that has us look at the hidden negative thoughts and judgments that underlie the ego's thought system. This training leads beyond the body (its emotions, psyche, intellect, and \"thoughts\") to the mind. If we do not see how everything in our lives is set up to serve the ego's goal of separation, and the heavy price we pay to be in this world, we will not choose against it and return to our true home, the ultimate positive result. That is why Jesus invites to look with him at the ego: \"The 'dynamics' of the ego will be our lesson for a while, for we must look first at this to see beyond it, since you have made it real. We will undo this error quietly together, and then look beyond it to truth\" (T-11.V.1:5-6). Everything in this world becomes \"positive\" because it is useful to the Holy Spirit. We are thus freed of the need to judge for ourselves what is positive or negative. As Jesus tells us in the text, it is best to let the Holy Spirit decide: \"Put yourself not in charge of this, for you cannot distinguish between advance and retreat. Some of your greatest advances you have judged as failures, and some of your deepest retreats you have evaluated as success\" (T-18.V.1:5-6). Forgiveness is the only \"programming\" the Course offers, and applying it to our lives is our only function and our only need, it leads to peace. Until we awaken fully from the dream of separation, the real positive result is a peace undisturbed by anything in this world, positive or negative. Also see Questions related to forgiveness."

In one sense, it is almost safer to assume that we are doing this almost all the time than to think that we are beyond such self-deception-- especially in the early stages of our work with A Course in Miracles. Specialness is like oxygen to the ego: without it, there is no ego! Therefore, to the extent to which we still identify with the ego, letting go of specialness is like letting go of our oxygen supply. It feels as if we will not survive. That is why Jesus has to reassure us that \"the death of specialness is not your death, but your awaking into life eterna"

    "text_input": "Q #827: A Course in Miracles refers to our \"attraction\" to guilt and suffering as being responsible for our difficulties in this world of perception. At first hearing, this would appear to be the opposite to what we experience. To be attracted to suffering of any kind sounds undesirable with nothing to recommend it at all. However we do seem to be attracted to hearing news of disasters happening to others, but not to ourselves. I guess if there are really no \"others\" and only me, then that is the hidden attraction, to prove to myself that there are others around separate from me. The downside to that is that if they suffer, then I am a candidate for the same. I think I've just answered my question. If all is one in the real world, no separation or suffering, as promised in the Course, that sounds okay to me. What I like about the Course is that it insists  that we/I really have no real choice other than to be joyful, in spite of appearances and feelings of despair. Please comment on this tricky bit of detective work.",
    "output": "Your observations are valid, as far as they go. What limits them is your perspective, which all of us who believe we are here in the world share, that begins from the premise that we know who we are, and that our identity has something to do with being a body in the world. For seeing ourselves this way, we believe a reasonable goal is to attempt to maximize our body's pleasure and minimize its pain as we make all of our careful plans and adjustments to the world. We don't seem to know that we are minds that have chosen to see ourselves as bodies, just so we don't remember that we are minds! And so the Course's teachings on guilt and suffering are hard to grasp when we operate out of our mistaken bodily identity (T-27.VI.1:1-4; 2:1-2). Yes, as you point out, we all seem to be fascinated by disasters in the world, but not simply because they demonstrate that others exist outside of us. More importantly, they seem to validate one of the ego's central tenets, that victimization is real (more on this shortly). And most people relish the opportunity to recount the catastrophic events they've personally lived through, never tiring of sharing all the excruciating details that demonstrate their specialness through their good luck or bad luck, survivor skills, etc. And the media, demonstrating the principle that ego minds are joined, seem increasingly committed to broadcasting these very dramatic tales of loss and triumphs against overwhelming odds. But beneath these more obvious examples of our attraction to guilt and suffering at the level of the world is a sinister motivation that few of us allow ourselves to be in touch with. But as we begin to grasp the purpose our false identity as bodies serves, these hidden layers become more visible. The lie behind our conscious belief that we don't want to suffer and see guilt is easily recognized, once we are willing to accept the Course's premise that our identity is mind, not body. If we really did not want to suffer and experience guilt, we would give up the charade that we are bodies at the mercy of forces outside ourselves that we cannot control. The desire for most of us may be unconscious, but we all want to seem to suffer as bodies to prove that guilt and attack thoughts reside anywhere but in our own mind. If your body can cause my body to suffer, either directly or indirectly, clearly the guilt and responsibility for my pain is yours and not mine. I am the victim and you are the victimizer, the ego loudly proclaims. We don't want to get rid of guilt, for guilt says the separation and attack on God are real. And we want the separation to be real (T-13.III.2:4-5) because we want our individuality, which comes from the belief in separation, to be real. We each just want to see the guilt in someone else. And in order to see it in someone else, we must suffer at someone else's hands (e.g., T-26.X.3-4; T-27.I.3-4). And to suffer at another's hands, we must believe that we are all separate, individual bodies, and not simply related aspects of one mind. The suffering and pain, although they seem to be experienced in the body, are only experienced in the mind (T-19.IV-C.5:2-5; T-28.VI.2:1-4). It is part of the ego's ruse to keep us mindless that convinces us that it is our bodies that suffer. It is the mind that thinks it can limit itself that suffers, and not the body (T-25.in.3:1-2), which is nothing more than the ego's symbol for limitation (T-15.IX.2:3-4; T-26.VII.8:7-10; T-28.VI.3:10). And so your opening observation, that the Course teaches that our attraction to guilt and suffering is responsible for our difficulties in the world of perception is true, but not in the way that you are thinking. Our attraction to guilt is responsible for our decision to believe that we have difficulties and suffer in the world so that we never look to where the suffering is really occurring, in the mind, where we could do something about it (W-pI.76.5). We have fooled ourselves into believing that we have difficulties in the world so that we don't have to look at our attraction to guilt and suffering --the ego's only offerings--in our mind. And so, while everything of the ego, including all its projections into the world of form, is illusory, until we look at what we have chosen to make real in our own mind, we will continue to believe that joylessness and despair are our only lot. Jesus knows that the only real choice is for joy, but we stubbornly refuse to accept his word and continue to believe that we can choose guilt and suffering. If we are first honest about the pain that we are each in and are willing to accept complete responsibility for our own suffering (T-11.III.1:4), we can then make a different choice (T-28.II.12). And we make a different choice by inviting a different Teacher to look with us at the foolish choice we have been making, so we can recognize that we don't need to continue to suffer."

    "output": "Jesus is describing for us in this section what we have accepted in place of reality as God created it. Truth, infinity, and life are all characteristics of Heaven; but when, as one Son, we decided to leave that state of Oneness in Heaven, we came up with a substitute world of our own, which we then believed was reality and truth. This world that consists of billions of individual entities is an illusory world, of course, because separating from Infinity and Totality is impossible--that is what the Atonement principle states. So in the sentence you quote, Jesus is saying that by believing we live in a world that is not Heaven, we have made illusion, time, and death the truth, instead of what is \"truly\" true. By identifying with the ego, we brought truth to the illusion. A Course in Miracles corrects that error by bringing the illusion to the truth, where it is undone. What seems so real to us is not real at all--it is an illusion that we sustain in our minds by denying the truth and believing in what we have made up instead. The way we undo this illusion is to bring it back to the truth, which is also in our minds, just as darkness disappears when you turn the light on."

    "text_input": "Q #829: There are two passages in the text (T-2.VI.4; VII.1) of A Course in Miracles where Jesus tells us that we are making a mistake when we ask him to release us from our fear. The correction of fear is our responsibility, he states; he cannot take it away, as that would be \"tampering with a basic law of cause and effect, the most fundamental law there is. I would hardly help you if I depreciated the power of your own thinking. This would be in direct opposition to the purpose of this course\" (T-2.VII.1:4-6). Is it correct to say that the law of cause and effect exists only within this world, as part of a dualistic world and belief in separation? Our only responsibility to accept the correction for the error, the Atonement, and forgive, and that once we accept the only cause, God, as causing us, we will recognize that everything else is an unreal effect of an unreal cause, the ego. Are we bound by cause and effect only to the degree",
    "output": "that we fail to accept, or defend against, the Atonement, and to the degree we think sin and guilt are real? One particular workbook lesson comes to mind: \"God's Will for me is perfect happiness. There is no sin, it has no consequence\" (W-pI.101.6:6-7). This seems to break the cause and effect connection, saying that if we forgive in this moment and accept that we are inflicting the perceived pain on ourselves and accept God's happiness again, we are free of the illusory effect because we gave up the illusory cause, the ego. Does Jesus mean there is cause and effect in that we willingly have to participate in forgiving the illusory cause, ego and accept the only Cause again? A: You are definitely heading in the right direction. We have devoted an entire audio album to this topic because of its centrality in the Course's thought system, and to do justice to your question we would have to say far more than we have space for here. But we will try to cover the key points. First, the principle applies to Heaven as well as to this world. In Heaven God is the First Cause and the Effect is His Son, beautifully rendered in the Lesson \"I am forever an Effect of God\" (W-pII.326). The text also describes this cause-effect principle in a poetic way: \"The cause a cause is made by its effects; the Father is a Father by His Son\" (T-28.II.1:2). In the world the cause-effect principle is commonly defined as \"every action will have a reaction.\" The essence of it is that for a cause to be a cause, it must have effects; if there are no effects, then it cannot be said to be a cause. An effect requires a cause, and if there is no cause, then it cannot be said to be an effect. The relevance of this to our personal work with the Course--to state it in the briefest way possible--is that our belief that we separated from God (our \"sin\") is the cause of our being here in the world and of all our problems here as well; therefore, if we can show that that cause has had no effects, then the cause will have been nullified as a cause. In other words, we will have \"undone\" the separation (our \"sin\"), and then the awareness of love's presence will have been restored to our minds. The world and our individual selves would have disappeared back into the nothingness from which they came. We would once again be our true Self, Christ, God's one Son. Thus, \"I am forever an Effect of God\" (W-pII.326). Abbreviating, again, what would take many pages to unfold, forgiveness is the way we learn that sin has had no effect. And that, of course, is what the entire Course is about. So you are correct in saying that our only responsibility is to accept the Atonement for ourselves, and that forgiveness is the means of our doing that. In the passages you referred to, the main point Jesus is making is that we are decision-making minds--very powerful minds--and that he will never interfere with that power, for if we do not recognize and respect the power of our minds to choose the ego, we will not be able to call upon that same power to correct that mistake. The entire Course rests on this--its whole purpose is to get us to respect the power of our thinking, not to depreciate it. Thus, when we ask the Holy Spirit things like getting us a parking space, or to heal cancer, bring about world peace, or to do anything in this world, we are asking Him to tamper with the law of cause and effect and thus to depreciate and deny the power of our minds. He will not do that. \"This is a course in cause and not in effect,\" Jesus reminds us (T-21.VII.7:8). And the cause he always brings us back to is that we believe we live as individuals in a world outside God and Heaven--the \"tiny, mad idea\" he describes in the text (T-27.VIII.6:2). In one paragraph in the section called \"The 'Hero' of the Dream\" (T-27.VIII), Jesus essentially presents us with a model of the gentle process of forgiveness as it is meant to be. We do not deny how terrible we feel; we just bring these terrible effects to him or the Holy Spirit, where we will look together at them, and then beyond them to their cause. And when we realize the cause is just a silly thought not deserving of our belief any longer, we will simply smile and then be at peace: \"In gentle laughter does the Holy Spirit perceive the cause, and looks not to effects. How else could He correct your error, who have overlooked the cause entirely? He bids you bring each terrible effect to Him that you may look together on its foolish cause and laugh with Him a while. You judge effects, but He has judge their cause. And by His judgment are effects removed. Perhaps you come in tears. But hear Him say, 'My brother, holy Son of God, behold your idle dream, in which this could occur.' And you will leave the holy instant with your laughter and your brother's joined with His\" (T-27.VIII.9)."

    "text_input": "Q #830: I would like to know if you think A Course in Miracles and Transcendental Meditation are compatible spiritual disciplines? I am studying the Course but enjoy the centeredness from my meditation time. I am asking about TM in particular and not meditation in general.",
    "output": "If you find Transcendental Meditation useful as a technique for helping you relax and become more peaceful and centered, by all means, continue to use it in your life. But if you want to use it as a spiritual discipline, integrating it with the practice of the Course, you may be introducing some confusion and potential conflict into your life. Now there is some disagreement as to whether Transcendental Meditation is simply a meditation technique or an actual spiritual discipline. Its proponents generally present TM in a non-spiritual framework in an effort to make it accessible to people of all ages, cultures, and religious backgrounds. But it has been developed by the movement's founder, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, from principles of the ancient Hindu Vedic tradition of India. The expressed purpose of the practice of TM is to achieve a state of consciousness called transcendental consciousness, which through repeated practice leads one towards what Maharishi calls enlightenment. However, enlightenment as defined within TM circles would not be considered a spiritual state from the perspective of the Course. For example, in a 1998 interview, Maharishi is quoted as saying: \"'Enlightenment' means lack of darkness, absence of darkness. And 'absence of darkness' means no mistake, no weakness, no shortcoming--success everywhere, fulfillment of desire everywhere--that is enlightenment. One is living in full accord with Natural Law\" (italics added). While the Course does provide a kind of mind training that leads to higher levels of consciousness (e.g., C-1.7:4-6), its purpose is to lead us ultimately beyond any perceptual-based consciousness and beyond any concern with the quality of our lives here within the world. In other words, from the Course's perspective, enlightenment involves a process of gradually awakening from the dream and not simply making the dream better. So the two paths, to the degree that there is an intended spiritual direction implicit in TM, have very different purposes. From the Course's perspective, TM would be like any technique or practice that provides some relief from the tensions and anxieties of seeming life in the body. The Course teaches that only the practice of forgiveness leads to the undoing of the guilt over separation buried deep in the mind that is the real cause of all tension and anxiety (e.g., W-pI.41.1:2-3; W-pI.194.2:1)."

    "text_input": "Q #831: What aspect of our mind(s) truly understands \"seeing through the illusion\"? It is obvious we cannot see through the illusion from within the illusion. To say merely that we \"see it with Jesus\" implies another separation between subject and object; i.e., there's a \"me\" and a \"Jesus.\" Can we use the duality to undo the duality? In a way, I think that is what the Course is \"doing.\" Still one is almost helpless in the face of the forces one faces here. We have continued, from a linear perspective for \"millions of years,\" to actively delay our recognition of oneness, with an almost total underestimation of the extent of our denial. There was only one denial but it has taken a million billion forms. As a seeming individual who wants neither to be a victim nor a victimizer anymore, the dream itself still appears virtually to force an either/or orientation to any given situation. If there is \"another way of seeing this,\" is there a corresponding symbolic shift in the world we still see, or is this just another delusion?  To learn A Course in Miracles and finally and totally \"renounce the ego in oneself\" appears to be a goal almost completely impossible, due to the duality inherent in the illusion, which seems to prevent the renunciation itself. Despite forgiving over and over again, I still get caught up and trapped in the illusions of the world. What would you recommend that may or may not be reflected in the Course to deal truthfully and effectively with this recurring nightmare, once and for all?",
    "output": "You are right in that, so long as our attention remains focused on the world and all its many challenges and complexities and limited either/or choices, there is no way out. But the Course does offer us something to help us extricate ourselves from this quagmire we have placed ourselves in--it's called a miracle. The miracle quite simply involves a shift in our attention from the world back to our mind. And rather than denying the world, the Course invites us to use the world itself to facilitate this shift. For the Course teaches that the world is nothing more than the projection of the contents of the mind. And at the level of mind, the choice is really quite simple--there are only two alternatives, the ego's content of attack and guilt and fear, or the Holy Spirit's content of love and joining and forgiveness. And we can tell quite easily which we have chosen by looking at how we are experiencing our world. Now this choice obviously is still within the realm of duality, but in the end we will come to recognize that there is after all no duality, for only one of the alternatives--love--is real. We are not being asked to try to stop seeing duality, nor to recognize that duality is unreal and the world is an illusion. Nor is it our responsibility to try to see beyond the illusion of duality to oneness. The Course's approach is an indirect one (T-14.I). Duality is not inherent in the world but in the split mind. The illusion can reinforce nothing unless we still want it to be true. We are being asked to look at all the ways we block any experience of oneness, which really boil down to one--our judgments, which keep separation and differences real and alive in our mind. In other words, nothing must be done to achieve a state beyond duality except to become aware of our continuing investment in duality, and in particular, in the judgments that maintain it, and then to recognize that each of our judgments has a cost. Forgiveness is the Course's process that allows us gradually to release our investment in duality and separation--this investment is the real obstacle and not the world, which is its effect. And you are right that it is a mistake to underestimate the extent of our denial. But it is critical that we understand that we are not forgiving the world and all of our external relationships, but our own choice for the ego. In other words, there is nothing that has to be done--only undone. And so our part is to continue to look at and beyond all the obstacles we have placed in our minds between ourselves and the awareness of love's presence. This does require patience, and while it is true that our belief in linear time can make this seem like a daunting process, that is why the Course invites us to use Jesus or the Holy Spirit to help us join in a holy instant outside of time. The conundrum you feel is in a sense part of the problem, for it simply continues to reinforce in your own mind the density and reality of the illusory ego. We cannot imagine how we can possibly get out of this nightmare because we still think that we have to get out of it. And the point is that the very self that is trying so desperately to understand and let go is in itself the obstacle. The self that wants to understand is part of what must simply be looked at and smiled at and in the very end released. There are steps in the process of coming to recognize the world, as well as the self we think we are, is illusory. Since we can't imagine what it's like not to get caught in the illusion, Jesus simply asks us to take the little steps that first allow us to begin to take the world and our problems and issues less seriously. This is the symbolic shift in how we see the world that you ask about, away from the oppositional roles of victim and victimizer. We begin with a change in the purpose that we give to the world and to our bodies, reflected in the recognition that our interests or purpose are shared with, not separate from, all our brothers and sisters. Acknowledging our one shared purpose begins us on the journey to recognizing our one shared Self. In the meantime, yes, as you observe, Jesus and the Course are using duality to undo duality rather than maintain it. While we continue to believe we are separate, we need a thought within the illusion, even if it seems separate from us, that reminds us of oneness. So Jesus, or the Holy Spirit, symbolize the part of our mind \"that truly understands 'seeing through the illusion,'\" as you put it. As Jesus tells us in many different ways through the Course, we must learn to separate from our ego. And so he uses the idea of duality or separation to help us begin the process of separating ourselves from the ego. Once we begin to release our investment and identification with the ego, our willingness to recognize its illusory nature will gradually increase and we will no longer need the defenses that the world and our bodies provide against experiencing the oneness that is our reality. Consider the following examples in the Course of how Jesus uses the language of duality and separation to facilitate this process, giving the words another purpose (italics added in each selection): \"The reason you need my help is because you have denied your own Guide and therefore need guidance. My role is to separate the true from the false, so truth can break through the barriers the ego has set up and can shine into your mind. Against our united strength the ego cannot prevail\" (T-4.III.2:4-6). \"You have regarded the separation as a means for breaking your communication with your Father. The Holy Spirit reinterprets it as a means of re-establishing what was not broken, but has been made obscure. All things you made have use to Him, for His most holy purpose. He knows you are not separate from God, but He perceives much in your mind that lets you think you are. All this and nothing else would He separate from you. The power of decision, which you made in place of the power of creation, He would teach you how to use on your behalf. You who made it to crucify yourself must learn of Him how to apply it to the holy cause of restoration\" (T- 14.VI.5). \"He [the Holy Spirit] will separate out all that has meaning, dropping off the rest and offering your true communication to those who would communicate as truly with you\" (T-14.VI.7:4). \"It is the body that is outside us, and is not our concern ... To see our Self as separate from the body is to end the attack on God's plan for salvation, and to accept it instead\" (W-pI.72.9:2,5). We are simply asked to trust a process that will gradually lift us out of the dualistic quagmire we have made real in our minds. But while we remain too fearful to let go of duality, Jesus simply uses the dualistic symbols of separation to undo our belief in separation. And he promises us release from the pain of our self-imposed conceptual prison if we allow him to guide our perception, as we look with him."

    "text_input": "Q #832: There are many questions in the index regarding the loss of individuality/identity. I think what people are wanting to hear is that even though they no longer exist as an individual, they still exist. I had a dream in which I was waiting in line at the motor vehicle bureau to get my driver's license renewed. I was idly looking around at the crowd of people waiting along with me, at the officials behind the windows, etc. Suddenly I became aware that the air was charged and as I looked at people's faces it dawned on me that we were all the same, one person, although we all still had different physical features. My sense of identity, even though I was no longer just me, did not diminish. It expanded--it felt completely safe, completely full, because there was no sense of separateness. But there was still a sense of being. My question is this: Is this sense of oneness of being, but still of being, what is meant by giving up one's separate ego identity? If it is, I can say that there is nothing to lose ... because we have only one Identity, and it belongs to all of us. We lose nothing by sharing in it.  Does it follow then that only the ego can fear loss, because only it equates being with having, and with having a body? So that when you have a fear of loss of your identity, it's just the ego panicking in its dualism, and in truth, you have nothing to lose? You cannot in fact lose your identity, because you exist, just not as the person you think you are?",
    "output": "You can think of your dream as a helpful symbol reflecting the oneness of spirit. It is of course difficult for us to understand what it means to be spirit while bodily thoughts so dominate our awareness, but then that of course is their purpose. They are there only by our choice, to affirm a false identity and deny our true Identity. And so symbols such as your dream give a reassuring glimpse of the reality beyond the illusion. Yes, only the ego can fear loss, because it is the belief that loss is possible and it is in fact the desire for loss. For the ego originated from the belief in separation, that we can take only what we want from God--our separate, individual self--and not accept the All that He is offering us. And that is a choice for limitation, which is loss--loss of the All that we have excluded from our individual self. It is in Heaven that having and being are equated, for there is no difference between them (T-4.VII.5:7). In contrast, the ego asserts that we have only what we have taken-- a dynamic spelled out clearly in the fourth law of chaos (T-23.II.9)--as if there were someone other than ourselves that we can take from. And so, ironically, the ending of limitation, which is really an expansion of our awareness, is experienced as loss of self so long as we remain identified with the ego. And it is not simply the body, but the personality and all the many ways in which we define ourselves as different and special and unique that are part of the false self we release when we identify with our true Self. If you consider the underlying nature of your dream, you can see that it is really no different from any other dream, except that you had an experience, much like a lucid dreamer, of what was really going on, incorporated into the dream itself. For in our dreams, all the characters are us--it is our sleeping mind that is dreaming all of them and giving them their seeming existence. But there is only one dream and one dreamer. And the self you thought you were in the dream was as much a figment of your mind as all the other characters in the dream. So it's not the figures in the dream that are one and share a single identity, but the mind that is asleep and dreaming of all the figures that is one and has a single identity. And when we awaken, nothing is lost and nothing real is taken away. And so it is with our waking dreams, as Jesus refers to our lives (T-18.II.5). All of the seeming separate individuals that seem to people this dream world, including the one we identify as ourselves, are really the projections of the single, sleeping mind of the Son, of which we are all a part. And so it is not the self that we think we are in the world that awakens, but rather the mind that is asleep and dreaming it is a figure in the world. And yes, its being does not depend on having a body. In your question, you seem to use the words existing and being interchangeably. In a couple of sections in the text of A Course in Miracles, Jesus makes a distinction between the words, with existence pertaining to the ego and being to spirit: \"The ego arose from the separation, and its continued existence depends on your continuing belief in the separation. The ego must offer you some sort of reward for maintaining this belief. All it can offer is a sense of temporary existence, which begins with its own beginning and ends with its own ending. It tells you this life is your existence because it is its own. Against this sense of temporary existence spirit offers you the knowledge of permanence and unshakable being ... Existence as well as being rest on communication. Existence, however, is specific in how, what and with whom communication is judged to be worth undertaking. Being is completely without these distinctions. It is a state in which the mind is in communication with everything that is real ... Remember that in the Kingdom there is no difference between having and being, as there is in existence. In the state of being the mind gives everything always (T-4.III.3:2-6; T-4.VII.4:1- 4; 5:7-8). In other words, our true being is always unaffected, but when we awaken, we will not seem to continue to exist as we experience ourselves now. Your dream, while not representing being, nevertheless reflects a helpful bridge between the two experiences, one illusory and one real. For it still is experienced in the realm of consciousness, which is an ego state, and an experience of being is beyond all dualistic consciousness. (For more on the ego nature of consciousness, see Questions #27, #127, and #636.)"

Sometimes I feel like something from outside of me--it feels like a bad energy--is coming inside my body. In these moments, fear always comes up in my mind. Is this normal? In these moments also, a person comes into my mind whom I want to blame for these attacks. What should I do in these moments to be still and practice forgiveness? A: It is enough to know that the ego is always ready to do battle any time we make the decision to find peace, using whatever forms it can to distract us from our purpose. These can include bodily symptoms and pain, energetic shifts and fear, and thoughts of anger and blame, as you are experiencing. All of these are not uncommon and are normal reactions of anyone still identified with the ego--which includes just about all of us! Once we recognize where the distractions must be coming from, all we need to do then is to acknowledge that the ego is their source and, as best we can, not become too concerned about the forms of its various attacks. We are simply afraid of the peace and it will not be helpful to try to fight ourselves, for that only gives power to our egos. And the Course's purpose is to help us learn how to withdraw that power from the ego--of itself it has none (e.g., T-4.IV.8:9; T-7.VIII.4:6; T-8.I.2:1). As for practicing meditation while doing the workbook lessons, there is nothing wrong with doing that if you find it helpful. But there is also no need for any specific meditation practice other than the meditation-like exercises presented in the workbook lessons themselves. The Course's practice is forgiveness--releasing judgments in the context of our relationships--and not meditation (T-18.VII.4:9-11; 5:1-3). The workbook's meditative-like exercises are provided simply to help us become more aware of the two different contents present in our mind--the ego's and the Holy Spirit's--so that we can become clearer just what the Course is inviting us to choose between as we learn to practice forgiveness (W-in.3:1; 4:1). The Course itself does not automatically do anything for us--nor does Jesus or the Holy Spirit. Each is a symbol that reminds us of the choice that only we can make to release the ego's past and bring our mind into the peace of the present instant (T-5.II.7:1-7). This present state, by the way, would not be called mindlessness in the Course, for mind has a different meaning in the Course from other spiritual teachings that equate the ego with finite mind and its constant idle chatter. The Course in contrast uses mind (with a lowercase m, since Mind with an upper case M refers to God or Christ [C-1.1:2]) to refer to all the capacities of the split mind, including consciousness, perception and decision-making or choice (T-3.IV.2). From the Course's perspective, we are mindless when we are identified with the ego, for we believe all of our problems come from our body and the world around us, rather than from our choice to identify",
    "output": "with the ego in our mind. And so we forget that we have and are a mind that has a choice about how to look at our experiences and begin to choose against the false perceptions of the ego in our wrong mind, allowing them to be replaced in our consciousness by the gentle and healing perceptions of the Holy Spirit in our right mind. So be kind to yourself as you proceed with your study and practice of the Course. The process can be a very simple as well as gentle one, if we don't try to force anything and simply learn to step back and watch the silliness of our ego as it attempts to convince us to continue to take ourselves and our lives seriously. As we are able to disengage our mind from the ego's endless strivings and manipulations, we will find ourselves smiling more of the time (W-pI.155.1:1-3), if only in our minds."

    "text_input": "Q #834: The idea presented in A Course in Miracles that \"Only what you have not been giving can be lacking in any situation\" (T-17.VII.4:1) is something that I am very resistant to. I feel that I am not getting the proper respect I deserve from certain people. Is the Course saying that at some level I am not giving them proper respect? I feel that I am! I feel that I have been overly respectful in content and form and some people are still disrespectful back. Can you explain the meaning of this phrase?",
    "output": "The passage you quote is understood in the light of one of the Course's fundamental principles of salvation: \"...giving and receiving are the same\" (T-26.I.3:6). This rests on the fact that all minds are joined (T-15.XI.7:1), and therefore everyone is included in the individual mind's choice to receive, and thereby give, the ego's message or the Holy Spirit's. These are the only two thoughts the mind can choose between. Only one of them can be held/received at one time, and only what the mind holds can be given. Allied with the ego and driven by the emptiness it fosters, we will not give or receive true respect in any relationship, because the love that the Holy Spirit brings will be lacking, no matter how seemingly respectful the behavior may appear to be. Choosing to listen to the ego's tale of separation means denying one's true Identity, and is an attack on the Sonship. The result is a profound feeling of lack. Special relationships with people and things are then sought to fill the void left by separation. A multitude of specialness needs are brought to these relationships: e.g., the need for respect, acceptance, recognition. Relating to others in order to have individual needs met is truly a lack of respect, even when the behavior is courteous and seemingly \"respectful,\" because its origin is the attack thought in the mind. The respect that is not being given is thus lacking, as the line you quote indicates. The mind receives the respect it deserves when it chooses the Holy Spirit. In the moment that His Love is received it is given to the entire Sonship, just as the separation attack included everyone. Only then will there be no need to seek respect or anything else from others, for nothing will be lacking. In fact, any show of disrespect will be perceived as a call for love (T-14.X.7). If someone's behavior evokes any other response or reaction, it means the mind has decided to put out receivers for the ego's message. The only thing that will correct the judgments and feelings that follow this decision is to decide differently. That is accomplished through forgiveness, which begins with acknowledging that the feeling of being treated unfairly/disrespectfully comes from a choice in the mind, not someone else's behavior. The ego's message was received and given because it was chosen. The Holy Spirit's Love is therefore lacking. The true respect we owe ourselves and everyone is to recognize that the source of one's feeling deprived of respect, and the other's attack of disrespect, is the mind of each, and then to see in both a call for help. As Jesus tells us in the text: \"I have emphasized that the miracle [forgiveness], or the expression of Atonement, is always a sign of respect from the worthy to the worthy\" (T-2.VI.8:1). Choosing respect in this way guarantees that what is received is given, and nothing will be lacking in any part of the Sonship. Awareness of this fullness may be blocked, but it nevertheless remains true. That is not to say that someone could not be kindly asked to discontinue some form of discourteous or disrespectful behavior. If guided by the Holy Spirit there would be no attack in the request, no judgment, and, most importantly, no expectation that the behavior change. The important thing to remember is that the respect we all seek is found in our minds, where we choose it by choosing the Holy Spirit instead of the ego. In the instant of choosing it, it is given to ourselves and everyone: \"Its [forgiveness'] offering is universal, and it teaches but one message: What is God's belongs to everyone, and is his due\" (T-25.IX.10:9-10)."

    "text_input": "Q #835: Forgiveness comes relatively easily to me when it involves the interaction of myself and another, but I am having difficulty in forgiving attacks against a child of 14. My ability to forgive my husband for attacks levied against my son (his step-son) has been only partially successful, as they recur even when I believe I have done my best to appeal to the Holy Spirit to let me see the situation differently. How can I change?",
    "output": "Perceiving another as unfairly treated is the same as perceiving oneself unfairly treated. It is the projection of guilt for attacking the Self by denying Its true Identity as God's Son, and choosing identity with the ego instead. In the ego's version of who we are (separate bodies), everyone in every relationship is projecting, attacking and defending. That is how the \"game of guilt\" (T-26.X.4:7) is played, and in it everyone loses. What is lost originally is the awareness of innocence in the mind. This is then experienced in the world as the loss of peace, which seems to be caused by the attacks of one person upon another. It does not matter who is perceived as victim or victimizer, the result is the same: identity with the body is established, defended and maintained. This in turn serves to keep belief in the reality of the separation alive. The first step in changing the perception of victimization is to acknowledge that this is, in fact, the dynamic that is in operation, regardless of the judgments and feelings you may have about the situation, or what the circumstances may be. The judgments and feelings are not denied, but their true source (beliefs held in the mind) must be acknowledged for change to occur. An important goal of A Course in Miracles is to teach us that everyone has a mind (including children), and that attack against oneself occurs in the mind when the ego is chosen. Recognition that the mind is the source of guilt for choosing the ego, which is then projected on to someone else, is already a change in the way one views the situation. A little willingness to recognize projection in operation is enough to begin the process of forgiveness, which is the only meaningful change. It is willingness to forgive your husband \"for what he did not do\" (T- 17.III.1:5). He has attacked your son, but he has not taken away his peace or yours. That can only be done by each one's choice in the mind. When this is understood, it becomes clear that forgiveness is total, applying equally to your husband, your son, and others. When an attack occurs, the Holy Spirit can help if we are willing to recognize that we have already judged the situation and that we are wrong in our interpretation. Only then can the Holy Spirit replace our perception with His. Any belief that the attack has had a real effect blocks the Holy Spirit's message, because a decision has already been made to listen to the ego which tells us the body is real and that attacks external to the mind are the source of pain and conflict. In Lesson 24 of the workbook, we find a way to clear the ego's static by generalizing its message to all relationships. Slightly paraphrased it tells us: \"We do not perceive anyone's best interests\" (W-pI.24). We must therefore question all the expectations we bring to relationships, and all the things we think bring happiness and well being to others. They are all based on the belief that we are bodies. If we are at least willing to introduce doubt in this belief system, the door opens to receiving the Holy Spirit's perception of a situation that seems to have only the interpretation the ego assigns to it. In the Course, Jesus teaches that in all relationships everyone acts out the same choice, the same guilt, and the same fear. That is what relationships are for, it is what we came to the world to do, and what the Holy Spirit needs us to see so He can reinterpret them for us. Although the attacks may not stop, the way they are perceived will change with the Holy Spirit's help. It is always difficult to see loved ones attacked. The choice to invite the Holy Spirit's light into the conflict will ease the burden of trying to fix it, and His peace will gradually ease the pain and tension. There could not be any greater comfort than the acknowledgment that the body is not our true identity, and that attack need not abolish peace. Whether or not your husband's behavior changes, on some level the peace that you experience as a result of accepting the Holy Spirit's definition of who we are and His interpretation of attack will be communicated to him as well as to your son. One of you will have chosen sanity by choosing the Holy Spirit/the right mind. You, your husband, and your son will thus know (again, on some level not necessarily consciously) that the original attack of believing in the separation has had no real effect. With this mindfulness, whatever you choose to do to help your husband and your son, your peace will be your comfort and theirs."

    "text_input": "Q #836: Though a long-time Course student, I am asking the following question from a \"normal\" or \"worldly\" perspective--finding it useful to step outside of the Course, and its own internal assumptions. It has sometimes been suggested that the Course's message--that the world we seem to inhabit is not actually real--will appeal particularly to individuals who happen not to be happy in their relationship with the world. Stating this in an extreme way, for the purpose of clarifying what is meant, there could be seen to be some similarity with suicidal thinking, in terms of the wish for escape.",
    "output": "Conversely, it might be the case that individuals who have a healthier psychological relationship with the world will be less drawn to A Course in Miracles, as its suggestions of escape are of little interest to them. The Course might thus be viewed as an unhelpful, even damaging, affirmation of the reality-avoiding thoughts of unhappy people. How would you answer such a criticism \"from the outside\"? A: In attempting to step outside of what you refer to as the Course's internal assumptions, you may be getting yourself tangled in some faulty assumptions that could trip you up in some perhaps not so helpful ways! Probably the most questionable assumption is that the Course's purpose is to provide an escape from the world, which would therefore make it especially appealing to those who are quite miserable and, in the extreme, considering suicide. That is a misreading of the Course's intent, which in turn reinforces one of the ego's cherished defenses-- that the world outside is the problem. Although occasionally the words of the Course may on a superficial reading seem to suggest it--for example, Lesson 23 \"I can escape from the world I see by giving up attack thoughts\"--the Course's purpose is not to help us escape from the world, for the world is not the problem, as the text of this lesson makes quite clear (W-pI.23.2; 4:2-3). And so anyone drawn to the Course, thinking and hoping it will provide an escape from the world and all its problems, will be sorely disappointed. The Course also makes it clear that death--and this is true no matter what form it seems to take, including suicide--offers no peace or escape (e.g., T-3.VII.6:11; T-27.VII.10:2; M-20.5). Yes, the Course does teach that the world is not real (e.g., W-pII.3:1). But if the world is not real, why would we need to escape it? The belief that escape is necessary only reinforces the belief that the world is real and is the problem, that it is something that needs to be escaped. It may be more accurate to say that the Course teaches us how to escape from the ego thought system that is the source of the world. But even that is not quite right. Rather the Course teaches us how to escape from our belief in and desire for the ego thought system, since the ego thought system itself is no more real and no more of a problem than its shadow--the world. The Course addresses a pivotal question: if the world is not real and can not victimize us, why do we believe that it is real and that it can hurt us and cause us unhappiness? And to accept the Course's answer to that question requires an honest self-evaluation that most of us are not yet willing to engage in, and certainly not anyone who is seeking simply to escape from the pain and suffering of the world. Believing that the world is real serves a very specific and deliberate purpose in the ego thought system--it is the smokescreen that keeps our attention rooted outside on the seeming externals of the world so that we never look at the thoughts of separation, sin, and guilt within our own mind that are the real cause of our pain and suffering (e.g., W-pII.3:2- 3). And so we conveniently believe that sin and guilt exist outside us in the world--in others and not in ourselves, thereby keeping us from ever examining our own thoughts and thus protecting the fragile ego and all its (our!) cherished beliefs. And so the Course does not ask us to deny the ego's effects--the body and the world--for we still find safety and comfort and our personal identity in those beliefs. Instead the Course teaches us how to use our body and the world for a different purpose--the Holy Spirit's rather than the ego's (e.g., W-pII.3:4). Again, we joined with the ego in making the world to prove to ourselves that the separation is real, along with its effects of attack and sin and guilt, so that the world, rather than our choice for separation, would seem to be the cause of all of our unhappiness. And so the Holy Spirit teaches us how to use our body and the world to uncover those thoughts buried in our minds and eventually to learn how to demonstrate that the ego and the world can have no effect on us unless we want them to. In other words, the world and the body are transformed from prison house to classroom, where we can learn the Holy Spirit's gentle lessons of forgiveness. Rather than suggesting that we can ignore the world because its not real, the Course teaches us to look very carefully at the world and our reactions to it so that we can get in touch with the buried contents of our split mind. And of course, once we can look at and beyond our belief in sin and guilt in the wrong mind, we will find the peace and the memory of God's Love that is reflected in the right mind. But we cannot get to that happiness and joy without first allowing the contents of the wrong mind to be undone. And that means getting in touch with our unhappy thoughts, which we do by looking honestly at their projections onto the screen of the world and all our painful and difficult relationships. This is no mindless denial or escape and in fact most people have great resistance to this looking process, not because there really is anything horrible there, but because we believe there is. Now it is true that the Course will have appeal to many who are not particularly happy in their relationship with the world. Most people do not seek another way if they are content with the road they are already traveling along. However, most people who are drawn to the Course, at least initially, are looking for a spiritual path that will make their experience in the world and their relationships in the world better, and perhaps make the world itself a better place. In other words, most Course students are not looking to escape from the world but rather to make it work better for them in meeting their specialness needs. And of course, as students progress in their understanding of the Course's teaching, they struggle with their growing realization that the Course does not offer this kind of help. Rather, it is attempting to help us recognize how unhappy we really are so that we will be willing to choose, not against the world, but against the ego thought system. Since the problem is our belief in and desire for the ego thought system, the Holy Spirit's task is to help us become clearer about the ego's expressions and costs, so that we will gladly allow our desire for and belief in it to diminish (T-14.II.1:1-5). As to whether those who have \"a healthier psychological relationship with the world\" might be less drawn to the Course, that may or may not be true. It can however be said with certainty that it is not the purpose of the Course to help us develop a healthier psychological relationship with the world. True, one of our developmental tasks as we mature as human beings is to learn how to adjust to the world and all its demands so that we can successfully meet all our needs as best we can at the various levels, from physical to social and emotional and psychological. And those who are considered well-adjusted and healthy tend to be those who have mastered the various skills to make their way through the world, dealing with both the positive and the negative with a certain degree of equanimity. But the Course has a different definition of health: \"Health is seen as the natural state of everything when interpretation is left to the Holy Spirit, Who perceives no attack on anything. Health is the result of relinquishing all attempts to use the body lovelessly. Health is the beginning of the proper perspective on life under the guidance of the one Teacher Who knows what life is, being the Voice for Life Itself\" (T-8.VIII.9:8-10). And later, \"Your health is a result of your desire to see your brother with no blood upon his hands, nor guilt upon his heart made heavy with the proof of sin\" (T-27.II.7:7). Few therapists or psychological self-help books offer this kind of direction and perspective! Health from the Course's perspective is really a reflection of the wholeness or oneness that is our true reality in Heaven. And so in the split mind, health is represented as the outcome of forgiveness, where differences are not seen as important and guilt and sin are not real, because we are allowing the Holy Spirit to heal our perception. The psychologically healthy may have reached a compromise with the world that allows them to function with some degree of satisfaction, as well as a certain level of acceptance of their personal and the world's limitations But there is a quiet desperation that must lie beneath the surface, for life in the world is like a house of cards, always on the verge of falling apart. On the other hand, many who have successfully negotiated their way through the world and could be perceived as having a healthy psychological relationship with the world may come to the very honest recognition that they are still not happy, not really happy, and so will be open to another way (e.g., T-31.IV). They may at last be coming to the recognition that their attraction to the world and all its special relationships is causing them pain rather than joy. Interestingly, recent psychological research suggests that those who have less accurate self- perceptions are less likely to be depressed. Or alternatively stated, those who have more accurate self-perceptions are more likely to be at least mildly depressed. So the price of experiencing happiness in the world seems to be denial, which can be an effective defense only temporarily. And that of course is the case for all happiness that depends on our relationship with the temporal world. We will eventually have to recognize that the world cannot make us happy, but not because the world is the problem, but only because that recognition will reinforce our willingness to look for and ask for another way of thinking about the world. And so Jesus and his Course are leading us to a place of healing within our minds that will allow us eventually to be in the world, fully present to everything that seems to be happening to us and around us, without taking it seriously and without getting caught in the ego's reactive, judgmental mode. Clearly, this in no way can be construed as an escape from the world, but rather represents accepting a different perspective on the world--the Holy Spirit's rather than the ego's. The path of the ascetic or the monastic or the hermit who withdraw from the world is the path that would have greater appeal to someone who is seeking an escape. The Course in the end will lead us out of the world's thought system, but only as a result of participating in the world fully, so that we can recognize its meaninglessness (W-pI.155). If our motivation for studying the Course remains to escape the world, we will sabotage its process by never allowing the world to serve the purpose the Holy Spirit would give it in place of the ego's. For the ego would have us see ourselves as victims at the mercy of the world, but the Holy Spirit would have us recognize the ego's unspoken purpose for the world as the vehicle for fulfilling our secret wish to see ourselves unfairly treated. And the world serves that purpose well so long as we see ourselves as separate from the world, with the world existing outside ourselves. We will never leave behind the thought system that made the world until we first look honestly at the world and our reactions to it, and then use those reactions as an opportunity to uncover the thoughts of ugliness and guilt and sin that we harbor within our own minds. For to reiterate, the world is not the problem from which we need escape--in fact there is nothing that truly needs to be escaped. Rather we need to look honestly at our own thoughts which are mirrored in the world outside until we can come to recognize that they actually have no power at all and can be released, not because they are miserable and wretched and unhappy, but because they are truly nothing."

He has had no contact with his daughter either. He has chosen to turn his back on the both of us. His family however continued to be interested in our lives. I found this situation extremely frustrating as his family would continually bring up my daughter's father (as if reminding me he had chosen to abandon us).",
    "output": "I since cut communication with the family, as I was overwhelmed with the situation. Over six months has passed and I am asking to see everyone involved in this situation differently (i.e., without judgment). I would like to heal the relationship with the family and my daughter's father. However, when I go to call or write a note or make some contact with them, I am reminded of all the pain I went through while I was in contact with them. I don't know how to heal this situation. It doesn't seem to go away. However I just can't bring myself to swallow my pride and try again at having a relationship with my daughter's side of the family. Can I find peace with this situation without physically making contact with these people again? How do I know that I did the right thing in severing the relationship with the family? I still feel somewhat haunted by my decision, but really don't know how to move on and find lasting peace in my mind with all of the above mentioned people. How can I look at a man that abandoned his/our child in a \"different light\"? A: Perhaps one of the hardest lessons to accept and learn as a student of A Course in Miracles is that our upset and pain, regardless of what our experience seems to be, is never the result of what someone else has or has not done to us (W-pI.5). Everything in our experience seems to shout otherwise, and it is usually not difficult to find allies who will support us in our perception of ourselves as victims. But if we genuinely want to heal our relationships and release ourselves from the conflict and hurt and anger, the Course asks us to shift our focus from the external situation to our own inner decision to invest in the belief in sin and guilt and attack and abandonment. For that is the only source of our pain (W-pI.23). This is not to justify what anyone else does or fails to do, but rather to clarify that we have always first made a decision within our own mind to perceive ourselves as a victim in order to defend against the pain of our own choice for guilt, or we could not be affected by what the other person does. This of course contradicts all the counsel the world offers, but that is simply because the Course is offering us a radically different way of perceiving ourselves, our lives, our relationships, and our world--one that affirms that we alone are the rulers of our universe and our destiny (W-pII.253). How loudly and vehemently does the world--and our ego mind-- protest this acceptance of total responsibility for our experiences (T-21.II.1-5). The Course will not advise you on the particulars of your situation, such as whether you should or should not have cut off contact with his family, or whether you should re-establish it. Helpful answers to those questions are only possible after you have addressed your own need to see yourself unfairly treated (T-26.X.3-5), a need by the way which you share, regardless of the form it expresses itself in your life, with everyone else who seems to walk this earth. So you don't want to judge yourself for choosing the victim role--all of us who find ourselves here, in our own specific ways, have made the same choice. And so until you are able to release the judgments of unworthiness that you hold against yourself for abandoning your true Self, everyone else will only continue to be a symbol of that inner choice, and contact with them will necessarily continue to be painful. As inadequate as it may seem to us to be, the truth is we are all only ever doing the best we can, given our belief in our limitations and the guilt that naturally accompanies those perceptions. And that blanket generalization applies to the father of your daughter as well. Are you aware that you do not refer anywhere in your question to the nature of your relationship with this man, other than to identify him as the father of your daughter? It appears that you so want to avoid acknowledging his relationship to you that you even refer to his family as your daughter's side of the family. Perhaps he has been your husband or lover, but the real nature of the relationship that you want to deny is that he is your brother, a brother who is just as self- accusing and guilt-ridden as you may feel, regardless of what face he presents to the world. But you will only come to such a forgiven perception of him by first recognizing the mirror to your own self that he is holding up to you (T-7.VII.3:9; T-24.VI.8). And so to release him from judgment is only to release yourself. And in that release you will necessarily perceive the both of you in a \"different light.\""

    "text_input": "Q #838: I would like to know if you think A Course in Miracles and Transcendental Meditation are compatible spiritual disciplines? I am studying the Course but enjoy the centeredness from my meditation time. I am asking about TM in particular and not meditation in general.",
    "output": "If you find Transcendental Meditation useful as a technique for helping you relax and become more peaceful and centered, by all means, continue to use it in your life. But if you want to use it as a spiritual discipline, integrating it with the practice of the Course, you may be introducing some confusion and potential conflict into your life. Now there is some disagreement as to whether Transcendental Meditation is simply a meditation technique or an actual spiritual discipline. Its proponents generally present TM in a non-spiritual framework in an effort to make it accessible to people of all ages, cultures, and religious backgrounds. But it has been developed by the movement's founder, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, from principles of the ancient Hindu Vedic tradition of India. The expressed purpose of the practice of TM is to achieve a state of consciousness called transcendental consciousness, which through repeated practice leads one towards what Maharishi calls enlightenment. However, enlightenment as defined within TM circles would not be considered a spiritual state from the perspective of the Course. For example, in a 1998 interview, Maharishi is quoted as saying: \"'Enlightenment' means lack of darkness, absence of darkness. And 'absence of darkness' means no mistake, no weakness, no shortcoming--success everywhere, fulfillment of desire everywhere--that is enlightenment. One is living in full accord with Natural Law\" (italics added). While the Course does provide a kind of mind training that leads to higher levels of consciousness (e.g., C-1.7:4-6), its purpose is to lead us ultimately beyond any perceptual-based consciousness and beyond any concern with the quality of our lives here within the world. In other words, from the Course's perspective, enlightenment involves a process of gradually awakening from the dream and not simply making the dream better. So the two paths, to the degree that there is an intended spiritual direction implicit in TM, have very different purposes. From the Course's perspective, TM would be like any technique or practice that provides some relief from the tensions and anxieties of seeming life in the body. The Course teaches that only the practice of forgiveness leads to the undoing of the guilt over separation buried deep in the mind that is the real cause of all tension and anxiety (e.g., W-pI.41.1:2-3; W-pI.194.2:1)."

    "text_input": "Q #839: How can one use the perspective of A Course in Miracles to look at a person who is verbally abusive and to become more peaceful within?",
    "output": "The first place the Course asks us to look in a relationship is at ourselves. Our feelings, judgments, and thoughts show us the unconscious content of the mind, i.e., the forgotten choice to deny the Self that God created and to identify with the ego instead. Guilt, along with feelings of emptiness, vulnerability, and unworthiness, are the inevitable result of that choice. When the guilt is projected out, it is experienced in relationships characterized by victimization scripts. Although victim/abused and victimizer/abuser have different roles in the relationship, both are acting out the fear that innocence has been irretrievably lost by the mind's attack on the Self. And so, motivated by a deep feeling of worthlessness, the victimizer feels compelled to attack in some form such as verbal abuse. The distorted thinking is that making another look bad makes the attacker look better. Thus, someone else's loss is his gain This is an expression of the fourth law of chaos found in Chapter 23 of the text: \"This seeming law is the belief you have what you have taken. By this, another's loss becomes your gain, and thus it fails to recognize that you can never take away save from yourself\" (T-23.II.9:3-4). The victimizer convinces himself that his accusations are truly justified. The underlying belief is that he has taken the other's innocence and now has it for himself. The victim believes the victimizer is to blame for his loss of peace and for his feeling unfairly treated. He is the innocent victim and many witnesses can be found to support this view. The true source of this feeling, however, is the mind that chose to throw peace and innocence away by identifying with the ego. The victim-victimizer plot is an ideal scenario for the ego to keep the mind's power to choose from awareness, by focusing attention on the external dynamics of the relationship. As with every relationship, peace is found in forgiveness. It begins with willingness to apply the above mentioned principles of the Course's teaching to the example you give, which releases it from the ego's interpretation of every victim/victimizer situation. It is now seen in a different light and for a different purpose. While the feeling of victimization may remain and should not be denied, the source is no longer seen as another's attack, but as the mind that chose to deny its true Identity as God's innocent Son. The attack then becomes an opportunity to see the guilt engendered by this choice in its projected form. Early in the text, Jesus gives us a process to help us practice forgiveness in any situation: \" ... the first step in the undoing is to recognize that you actively decided wrongly, but can as actively decide otherwise ...Your part is merely to return your thinking to the point at which the error was made, and give it over to the Atonement in peace. Say this to yourself as sincerely as you can, remembering that the Holy Spirit will respond fully to your slightest invitation: I must have decided wrongly, because I am not at peace. I made the decision myself, but I can also decide otherwise. I want to decide otherwise, because I want to be at peace. I do not feel guilty, because the Holy Spirit will undo all the consequences of my wrong decision if I will let Him. I choose to let Him, by allowing Him to decide for God for me\" (T-5.VII.6:3,5-11). Because the true source of victimization is a decision in the mind, this format addresses the problem with no mention of the \"attacker.\" The important thing is taking responsibility for the mind's choice without judging this mistaken choice as a sin. When this occurs, peace is possible no matter what kind of attacks may be hurled at us. Then, with the Holy Spirit's help, you may choose to take steps to improve the relationship in some way or discontinue it altogether. When the Holy Spirit has been chosen, whatever follows will be loving for both you and the other person."

    "text_input": "Q #840: If the world I see is the guilt in my mind projected outwards, then does that not make me responsible for the suffering I see in this world? Jesus healed the sick with his right perception, so how can I practically apply that to the suffering I see in this world?",
    "output": "We do not know whether or not the historical Jesus healed the sick. There are no historical documents of his life, besides the gospel accounts, which were written many years after his death and whose factual accuracy is disputed by scripture scholars. The Course does not teach that Jesus heals our minds or our bodies. The healing Jesus teaches in the Course is accomplished by a choice in the mind. The mind that chose to identify with the ego thought system is sick, and is healed as it learns to choose against the ego by choosing the Holy Spirit. Neither Jesus nor the Holy Spirit makes that choice for us. As Jesus tells us in the text: \"I cannot choose for you, but I can help you make your own right choice\" (T-3.IV.7:11). That is the ultimate healing goal of A Course in Miracles. It is achieved through a process of exposing the sickness of the ego's thought system: its dynamics, purpose, goal, and painful effects. Since the ego's greatest defense is denial, its exposure is the beginning of its undoing/healing. Exposing the ego weakens it, just as some forms of bacteria cannot survive in the dry warmth of sunlight. Thus, bringing the darkness of the ego's sickness to the light of forgiveness is the healing Jesus teaches in the Course. What we are directly responsible for is the mind's choice for separation, which is the source of guilt and the world's suffering (including our own). The suffering we perceive is the reflection of our own pain, perception is interpretation. The problem lies not in seeing suffering in the world, but in seeing those who suffer as different from ourselves. We are taught in the Course that everyone who chooses separation is sick and in need of healing: \"A sick person perceives himself as separate from God\" (M-22.6:5). Sickness is thus equated with separation, and so healing is the undoing of separation. Everyone who identifies with the body is suffering, whether the pain is obvious, or camouflaged as pleasure. In the insanity of the ego's plan for \"life\" apart from God in the body, pleasure and pain are the same: \"Pain compels attention, drawing it away from Him (the Holy Spirit) and focusing upon itself. Its purpose is the same as pleasure, for they both are means to make the body real. What shares a common purpose is the same\" (T- 27.VI.1:3-5 italics added). It is not our responsibility to determine who is in need of help, not to mention the fact that we could not make the distinction if we wanted to. In the ego's upside-down thinking we are confused about everything, especially pain and pleasure. \"Sin [separation/sickness] shifts from pain to pleasure, and again to pain. For either witness is the same, and carries but one message: 'You are here, within this body, and you can be hurt. You can have pleasure, too, but only at the cost of pain'\" (T-27.VI.2:1-3). Given this predicament, our only responsibility is to allow the Holy Spirit to heal our minds through the practice of forgiveness. Whenever we find ourselves upset about anything in the world, Jesus would have us see an opportunity to remember that we have chosen to believe the ego's message that the body is real and, reminiscent of Pogo's claim, we are \"it.\" The healing Jesus offers in the Course is focused on this belief, which is the true source of everyone's pain. The ego's lie has made us sick, and the Holy Spirit's truth will heal us. If you choose to do something to alleviate a specific form of suffering in the world, the real goal remains allowing the Holy Spirit to heal your mind of the thought of separation. Choosing this as the purpose of your work is a truly meaningful contribution to the Sonship. At the end of the text, Jesus' healing message to all of us is the same: \"In every difficulty, all distress, and each perplexity Christ calls to you and gently says, 'My brother, choose again.' He would not leave one source of pain unhealed, nor any image left to veil the truth\" (T-31.VIII.3:2-3)."

    "text_input": "Q #841: Are we in the process of the Last Judgment? Is this the Apocalypse?",
    "output": "Many people view the disasters that have occurred and are still occurring around the world as heralding the Apocalypse and the Last Judgment, as described in the Bible. According to the Bible, the Last Judgment is the final phase of God's punishment of sinners. The Course's definition of the Last Judgment is radically different. In A Course in Miracles, the Last Judgment is the end of the process of creation, not of punishment: \"It is a final healing rather than a meting out of punishment, however much you may think that punishment is deserved. Punishment is a concept totally opposed to right-mindedness, and the aim of the Last Judgment is to restore right-mindedness to you. The Last Judgment might be called a process of right evaluation. It simply means that everyone will finally come to understand what is worthy and what is not\" (T-2.VIII.3:3-6). The true meaning of the Apocalypse flows from this; it is solely connected with the process of freeing our minds to \"choose to preserve only what is good ... [and] inevitably disown its [the mind's] miscreations which, without belief, will no longer exist\" (T-2.VIII.4:3-5). This is why Jesus assures us that the world will end not in a conflagration but rather \"with the benediction of holiness upon it. When not one thought of sin remains, the world is over. It will not be destroyed nor attacked nor even touched. It will merely cease to seem to be\" (M-14.2:9-11). From the perspective of A Course in Miracles, thus, the Last Judgment pertains to life and love, not to death and fear (T-2.VIII.5). It is the merciful call within our own minds beckoning us to return to the eternal peace in which we were created by God (W-pII.10.4:1). Correcting the traditional view, Jesus therefore assures us that God's Final Judgment is not to be feared, but gladly welcomed: \"You are My holy Son, forever innocent, forever loving and forever loved, as limitless as your Creator, and completely changeless and forever pure. Therefore awaken and return to Me. I am your Father and you are My Son\" (W-pII.10.5:1-3)."

Nothing external or in the world can hurt you; only your interpretation of it can hurt you. The thoughts in your mind will try to convince you that what is happening in the world is you and is happening to you. In light of this, can I go through my entire life as a body in the world with paranoid and angry thoughts and still know--even though it seems otherwise --that all this has nothing to do with me?",
    "output": "The core message Jesus conveys to us in many ways throughout A Course in Miracles is that nothing other than our own thoughts can hurt us. \"I can be hurt by nothing but my thoughts\" is the title of a workbook lesson (W-pII.281), echoing what he said in an earlier lesson: \" ... once you understand it is impossible that you be hurt except by your own thoughts, the fear of God must disappear\" (W-pI.196.8:3; see also; W-pI.190.5; T-20.IV.1). Yet, in the end, even our own hurtful thoughts are nothing. We have never stopped being the invulnerable, perfect Son of a perfect Father. Imperfection of any kind is impossible in reality. Importantly, what Jesus adds to this teaching is that \"I can elect to change all thoughts that hurt\" (W-pI.284), which means that if you go through your entire life with paranoid and angry thoughts, you have elected not to change them. Note, though, that Jesus does not say \"I must elect ... \"; just \"I can elect ... \" Granted, these thoughts are coming from your ego self, not your true self, but they would not be there at all unless you had a reason for not letting them go. That really should not be ignored, given the craftiness of the ego in sustaining its presence. Because our minds are split, we can be aware of terribly hateful, judgmental thoughts, yet know they have nothing to do with who we truly are. But if you are not experiencing your true, right-minded self, then, as a decision-making mind, you must have chosen to identify with your wrong-minded self instead. As minds, we can observe our ego thoughts, which is what Jesus strongly urges us to do; but the purpose of the observing is to enable us to take the next step with him and realize that the decision to hold onto these thoughts is a decision not to be peaceful. Thus, you just want to be sure that your ego is not sneaking in the back door in your practice of this principle. Recalling the old saying that the devil can cite Scripture for its own purpose, we can say something similar about the Course: the ego can use Jesus' teachings in the Course as a means of sustaining itself (T-5.VI.4)."

I sometimes am quite afraid that what the book does is manipulate and brainwash me into a stupid numbness. Is this just the resistance to \"learning\"? Personally I do feel a very strong sense of relationship with Jesus, but that looks quite a bit different, and is much easier. Does Jesus mean to \"crack us open\" and cut us out of the eggshell we have surrounded us with? I find this definitely frightening. I seem to be losing all the people that I love and/or depend upon. Will this ever be getting any better? A: The Course stirs up fear in most of its students. This is normal, but temporary, because it is bringing to the surface of our minds some awful stuff we have been afraid to look at. Jesus' purpose, though, is not to make us more fearful, but rather to help us see that our fear of what is within us is not justified. It has all been based on false beliefs about God and ourselves. When you look within with Jesus' comforting love next to you, as he asks us to do, your fear would begin to subside, or at least stay under control. If you already have a nice relationship with him, which you seem to have, why not just stay with that?

    "text_input": "Q #844: In the answer to #589 on psychic powers, you told the questioner that if he or she thinks they know the specific purpose for something that they are doing or saying to be helpful to someone, then they are probably coming from their wrong mind. Could that be a general rule of thumb for all of us following this path even if it does not concern psychic powers, that we really do not know why what we say or do for someone may be helpful? A: Yes, that is a pretty safe bet. And the reasoning behind this is that nearly every reason we may come up with for what is helpful about what we are doing will come from the perspective of seeing ourselves and others as bodies, with specific needs (T-1.VI.1,2). But from the perspective, of A Course in Miracles, there are only two possible reasons for doing anything. Either we are wanting to reinforce our investment in the ego thought system or we are wanting to release that investment through forgiveness. And when our focus remains on bodies, to the exclusion of the mind--where the only problem and the only real choice reside--we are maintaining our commitment to the ego and its belief in the reality of the separation and all its effects. That is not to say that this is our conscious intention, but then the ego never wants us to be aware of what we are really up to when we are listening to its voice. Using the Course's metaphor of the dream for our lives, our reasons for doing things always come from the perspective of the dream figures, and not from the perspective of the dreamer, which is who we really are within the split mind. And so all our seeming reasons for doing things continue to make the dream and all its figures real and keep us asleep and dreaming, which of course is the ego's purpose. But when we are in our right mind, all of our choices will be leading us to identify increasingly with the dreamer, so that our understanding will grow that we are only ever choosing between continuing to dream and waking up (e.g., T-4.I.4:4-7; T-10.I.2,3; T- 18.II). And so that is why Jesus tells us very early in the workbook that we are never upset for the reason we think (W-pI.5). We think we are upset because of what seems to be happening to the dream figures in the world, but Jesus is trying to help us see that we are upset because we are choosing to dream a dream that represents the ego's content of sin, guilt and fear, so that we do not have to take responsibility for our choice in the mind for the ego. And so if none of us is ever upset for the reason we think, and our upset has nothing to do with what is happening in our lives --the dream--how could we know what specifically would be truly helpful for ourselves or anyone else? We are only ever truly helpful to ourselves and others when we are remembering the only meaningful choice we ourselves have--to which teacher shall we listen, to guide our perception of what seems to be happening to ourselves and others--the ego or the Holy Spirit (T-26.V.1). And our remembering of that choice serves as a simple reminder to others that they have the same choice (M-5.III.2). That is the only real reason for doing anything. The form of what we do will then reflect an appreciation of shared rather than separate interests, but the form itself is never what is helpful. It is always the underlying content, which will be leading us all gently out of the dream of separation, toward an awakening to the glorious Self that we all share, and are (T-22.IV.7:8).",

    "text_input": "Q #845: In one of your statements you said imagine walking through this world loving everyone you meet, which would be a state of complete forgiveness. However, I have not known or heard of anyone who has ever reached this state no matter how long they study A Course in Miracles. In fact, I read about people who have been studying the Course for twenty years who are still at square one, carrying hate, envy, etc., for someone. And I'm around Course students all the time who have been studying for years and they don't seem different from anyone else. More knowledgeable concerning the Course, yes--more capable of forgiving, no. I don't know any Course students who have moved up the ladder in any real sense. Why continue studying the Course if after 15 or 20 years one is still losing one's temper, not being able to forgive, still begging for help in seeing these difficult life situations through the eyes of Jesus? What's the point when the Course teaches it's already over and no one is left behind? Why put all this time into something so difficult to understand when it gets you nowhere? The Course is beautiful but it does not seem to have any practical value. A: You sound pretty frustrated with your experience with the Course. Jesus never says it's an easy path and it does require a great deal of patience with ourselves (and others!), as we uncover all the various aspects of the ego thought system and become increasingly aware of the connection in our beliefs between our judgments and attacks and our need to preserve the self we believe we are. In one sense, because the ego is a total thought system, which in itself is not mitigated nor modified in the least by our study and practice of the Course, we are always back at square one when we are identifying with it. The ego is pure, unadulterated hatred, attack and murder and this does not change, no matter how long we have been studying the Course. What hopefully changes is how long we continue to give life to the ego before we are willing to ask for a different Teacher, for the Holy Spirit too is a total thought system--one of pure, unadulterated love. So it's not that we stop getting angry and judging and hating, but the periods of time when we choose against that anger and hatred gradually increase, as we begin to recognize sooner when we have chosen the ego and can acknowledge its cost to our peace and joy. Yes, at the very end, at the top of the ladder, we will no longer get angry or hate or judge. But to expect ourselves--or others--to be free of judgment and anger as we progress up the ladder is not a realistic expectation. After all, Jesus nowhere in the Course tells us not to get angry--he just asks us to accept that it is never justified (e.g., T-30.VI.1:1; M-17.8:6).",
    "output": "It is helpful to remember that we are simply not in a position to judge anyone's progress with the Course, including our own (T-18.V.1:5-6). When we judge others, we rely on external behavior--form--and we simply do not know how another's mind may be vacillating between right-minded and wrong-minded content. If we can have compassion for the fear and resistance that others may experience in this process of letting go of judgment, we will also be able to be gentler with ourselves when the resistance is great. Again, it is helpful to remember that the judgment and hatred serve a purpose--self-preservation of the ego, and therefore, of the self we believe we are. And so the resistance will be tremendous and the progress may at times seem snail-like in its pace. But again, we are not in a position to judge anyone's progress on this path, including our own. It may also help to consider a larger context for the healing process that the Course is attempting to foster, acknowledging at the same time that using a linear temporal framework can be a bit misleading. The Course has been available for about 25-30 years. We are attempting to undo a thought system that we have spent thousands, even millions of years investing in and making real (T-2.VIII.2:5). Twenty years of attempting to understand the ego's thought system as well as the Course's thought system of correction and then applying its principles, which will necessarily shift in terms of their application as our understanding of the Course deepens, is nothing in comparison. Of course, it's not really the amount of time studying and practicing the Course but the level of guilt and fear we allow ourselves to get in touch with so that they can be undone that determines our progress. And for most of us, the fear of losing the self we cherish as real is what secretly motivates us to continue to judge and hate and attack and justify those perceptions. And because of the many levels at which the Course is written, which really reflect corrections for the many layers of the ego thought system, we can fool ourselves into believing we are practicing its principles when we are subtly reinforcing our egos. And so each of us who sees the Course as our spiritual path must ask ourselves honestly--am I putting the Course's principles into practice or am I simply studying the Course, attempting to keep it as primarily an intellectual exercise? It can take many years of study before our fear level subsides enough to allow ourselves to hear what Jesus is really saying. The Course's purpose is not simply to teach us to stop judging and hating, but to learn to recognize at deeper and deeper levels what the costs of that judgment and hatred are. For that is what motivates us to let go of our judgments and hatreds and release the fear that maintains that forgiveness will lead to self- annihilation. Your experience with the Course and its students sounds quite negative, but there are many who, although not claiming to have reached the top rung of the ladder, do report experiencing major shifts in their perceptions of others and themselves as a result of applying the Course's principles of forgiveness. And many students also report that others--friends and family--have observed big changes in the Course student without knowing just what exactly may have brought it about. It is only the ego that would want to deny any shifts in allegiance away from the ego and toward the Holy Spirit. You may also wish to consider that A Course in Miracles may just not be your own particular spiritual path, and that certainly has to be okay. There may be some other form of spirituality that will help you to release your own anger and judgments and take the steps that will lead you back home, where we are all heading, no doubt stumbling and falling at times along the way, but still progressing surely towards that inevitable outcome, when we will truly know that \"it's already over and no one is left behind.\""

Sometimes my ego wants me to feel inferior or worthless, especially when my wife is telling me that she thinks I am a cheat, a sneak, a thief, a hypocrite etc. A part of me tells me she is right because I love someone who can't love me and uses me for her own needs. I need to forgive both women and myself.",
    "output": "A Course in Miracles teaches that the way we look at the darkness with Jesus or the Holy Spirit is through the process of forgiveness. This means recognizing the real source of the problem (the mind) so it can be healed. The attack against the Self originated in the mind when it chose separation and identified with the ego. It was then intensified when the mind chose to forget the choice it made for separation, thus refusing to take responsibility for it and projecting blame onto persons, things and situations external to itself. The result is profound guilt, and feelings of being a cheat, thief and hypocrite, as well as having been cheated, robbed and deceived. These feelings are then projected out and experienced in some form, such as the situation you describe. In this activity of the mind lies the source of every conflict in the world, as well as in our personal lives. Looking at the darkness with Jesus through forgiveness begins with a little willingness to accept that this is true, and that we are wrong about our interpretation of every situation. We need not strive to see innocence, beauty or light in others. Rather, we walk in forgiveness by seeing the layers of judgment we have used to cover the innocence, beauty and light that is theirs and ours. It is our denial of these judgments that keeps them in place and casts a shadow on the light preventing us from seeing the Christ in anyone including ourselves, which accounts for feelings of unworthiness and inferiority. Although these feelings have their real source in the choice for separation outlined above, they find their justification in the dream in some specific form, such as the extramarital affair you describe. The specific circumstances provide the opportunity to be both victim and victimizer, thus accomplishing the true goal of the special relationship, in which guilt is projected, defended and justified. This is certainly not what the goal seems to be, but it is what the teaching of the Course reveals is the true nature of all of our relationships. Every special relationship also serves as the means for satisfying the seemingly endless needs that arise from the deep sense of lack the separation thought evokes. Practicing forgiveness means seeing these hidden dynamics for what they are: the ego's dance of guilt and specialness underlying all the feelings you describe. This is the first step in bringing the ego's darkness to the light of forgiveness. It has nothing to do with changing behavior. The miracle/forgiveness is seeing differently; in other words, a shift in perception. The shift is from the body/behavior to the mind/thought. The following passage from the manual expresses both the simplicity of the process and its \"difficulty\" due to our identification with the body: \"What is the single requisite for this shift in perception? It is simply this; the recognition that sickness is of the mind, and has nothing to do with the body ... For with this recognition is responsibility placed where it belongs; not with the world, but on him who looks on the world and sees it as it is not. He looks on what he chooses to see. No more and no less. The world does nothing to him. He only thought it did\" (M-5.II.3:1-9). The term \"body\" refers not only to the physical body but the psychological and emotional body as well. \"World\" includes everything we believe makes up the world of bodies, such as relationships. A careful reading of the passage tells us that what you are feeling has nothing to do with the women in your life, nor with the nature of your relationships with them. The feelings and judgments come from a choice in the mind to identify with the ego which precedes the experience of the relationships. Willingness to recognize this and accept responsibility for the choice brings the cause back to the mind where Jesus and the Holy Spirit abide as symbols of the part of the mind that does not identify with the ego/body. It is then possible to hear Their voice guiding all relationships in keeping with our oneness rather than specialness. The only thing required at this point is not to interfere with judgments about what or who is right or wrong, or how to see or feel differently. Jesus gives us clear instructions and a beautiful prayer to help us in our process: \"Keep but one thought in mind and do not lose sight of it, however tempted you may be to judge any situation, and to determine your response by judging it. Focus your mind only on this: I am not alone, and I would not intrude the past upon my Guest. I have invited Him, and He is here. I need do nothing except not to interfere\" (T-16.I.3:8-12)."

    "text_input": "Q #847: Is the soul a unit of Christ?",
    "output": "A Course in Miracles does not use the term soul except in reference to the Bible: \"The term \"soul\" is not used except in direct biblical quotations ... It would, however, be an equivalent of \"spirit,\" with the understanding that, being of God, it is eternal and was never born\" (C-1.3:2-3). The Course also uses the term mind to refer to the true Identity of God's Son. In this Mind, God and His Son, Who is the Christ, are one: \"Christ is the Son of God Who is in no way separate from His Father, Whose every thought is as loving as the Thought of His Father by which He was created\" (T-11.VIII.9:4). We are taught in the Course that the dream of separation began when: \"Into eternity [the eternal mind], where all is one, there crept a tiny, mad idea [separation], at which the Son of God remembered not to laugh\" (T-27.VIII.6:2). When the thought of separation is taken seriously, the Son falls asleep and dreams a dream of separation in which there seem to be individual fragments of the one Son. This split off part of the mind, which seems to have a separate existence, could be considered a \"unit of Christ.\" In reality Christ is a whole that cannot be split into separate units. By choosing to identify with the thought of separation, however, the wholeness of the Identity of Christ is \"forgotten,\" but it is not shattered. Thus, while part of the mind sleeps and dreams it is a body, there is a part that does remember the truth. Meanwhile, each seeming \"unit\" is responsible for recognizing the choice the mind makes to remain asleep when it chooses to identify with the body in the dream of separation. By teaching us that we pay a heavy price for this choice (losing awareness of our true Identity as Christ), Jesus motivates us to learn to make another choice. This is learned gradually through the practice of forgiveness, whereby we learn to see in every experience in the dream the reflection of the mind's choice to identify with separation (the ego) or with truth (the Holy Spirit). When a final choice is made to identify only with the Holy Spirit, separation will be forgotten and the wholeness of Christ will be remembered. This will occur when every illusion has been forgiven, and every belief that there is something outside of oneness is relinquished. In this awakening the dream will end, and the wholeness of Christ will be restored to awareness."

While teaching that time does not exist in the Mind of God (and therefore does not exist at all), the Course nevertheless inserts",
    "output": "itself into the historical, i.e., temporal, sequence - illustrated by the fact, which you have pointed out before, that the \"psychological approach\" of the Course is \"heavily based on Freud's insights into the human psyche.\" The point is made even more explicitly in one of the Lighthouse articles: (March 2001), which asks, \"Why this insane fear of the truth?\" And answers: \"It is one of A Course in Miracles' important contributions to world spirituality that it supplies the answer in a way that Saint Paul's famous problem, for example, was never really answered--an answer, incidentally, that was incapable of being understood or accepted in a pre-Freudian age.\" Doesn't this suggest that human consciousness evolves through history, and that the message from eternity that is A Course in Miracles is in some way dependent on that evolution? A: While believing we are in time, we will necessarily use the symbols of time, both to assist us in understanding relationships that are not truly temporally linear, but from our perspective seem to unfold in some logical sequence across time, and to communicate to others who have no reason yet to even question the reality of time and space (W-pI.184.9). But it would be a mistake to give explanations based on time any more reality than we give to any other aspect of the ego thought system. Time is an illusory conceptual filter through which we process shifts in our understanding that happen in the mind outside of time and space, while we still want to believe the world and our individual selves are real. If we consider that there truly is no linear time and everything that can possibly happen within the world of time and space all exists simultaneously in the mind as potential experience that is already over (T-26.V.3), then we can begin to grasp that there can be no truly causal relationship between events \"in time.\" If we consider the mind as holographic, then any moment in time simply represents the totality of thoughts that we are choosing to allow into our awareness at that one moment. And each moment in time as our ego mind has set it up seems to contain memories of what has come before, an experience of what is happening now, and thoughts and musings about what may happen in the future. But these distinctions are simply tricks of the ego mind to make sin, guilt and fear seem to have a multidimensional reality as past, present and future (Kenneth Wapnick's audio album, From Time to Timelessness, elaborates on this translation from the concepts of the ego mind to the seeming external reality of the world of time and space). For sin rests on a belief in a past that is already over, that cannot be undone, that is having consequences in the present, with the certainty of an even worse hell off in the future (T- 15.I.6). And yet it is only the choice in the present moment in the mind that makes any of this seem real to us, and that is a choice that can just as easily be undone in the present by asking for a different Teacher in our mind (T-15.I.8,9). To return to the specific issues raised in your question in light of this understanding of the holographic, nontemporal, nonspatial nature of the mind--there is a moment experienced in time that includes the thought that there was a distant past when Jesus walked the earth, and also the thought of a less distant past when Freud elaborated his understanding of the nature of the mind, including its defenses of denial and projection. But these events do not exist in the past as causal antecedents to the present day Course, but are only thoughts we hold in our mind now to explain in a less fearful way in time how we seem to be coming to an understanding of the principles of forgiveness that are reflected in the Course. Jesus remains always outside of time and space, offering the correction for the ego thought system, but we interpose conceptual filters, including time, between ourselves and his message of pure love, to keep him and his love at a safe distance. The hologram of the mind may just as likely contain a thought of a present moment that includes a recent past in which Jesus has explained everything we need to know about our blocks to his love and we have willingly embraced his teaching, forgiving all our brothers and accepting the Atonement for ourselves, without the thought of a distant past with a crucified Jesus, without the thought of a more recent past with the brilliant insights of a Sigmund Freud, and without the thought of a book called A Course in Miracles. Salvation does not depend on anything that happens in time! It only depends on our willingness to look at and let go of the blocks to the awareness of love's presence that we continue to cling to in our minds right now. And the forms in which we may choose to experience that only reflect the symbols that are personally most meaningful for us in our undoing process right now, and nothing more (M-2.3). Kenneth Wapnick's book, A Vast Illusion, provides a much more extensive discussion of the nature and uses of time, from the perspective of both of the teachers in our mind."

    "text_input": "Q #849: In The Most Commonly Asked Questions about A Course in Miracle, it is said in several different places that the mind is never in the body, and that it is impossible to answer \"where it is.\" This is very confusing to me. Does the mind not temporarily reside in a body while it is animated (alive) and where our lessons are being learned? Is it not the mind that animates a body? Isn't the life force and the mind one and the same? If not, WHAT animates a body for a while until its demise? Is it not the mind which chooses to inhabit a body for learning purposes?  I once had an experience during which my mind (or was it my consciousness?) seemingly left the body and merged with what felt like the All, where I felt whole, and no more questions were needed. I no longer felt like an \"I\" but an indescribable sense of \"neutrality,\" like nothing and everything at once. What was that? Did this have anything to do with the mind?",
    "output": "The body is simply an illusory projection of the mind, but it remains a thought within the mind, animated by the mind's desire for that thought to appear alive, just as in a dream (e.g., T- 27.VIII.1:1-2; W-pII.5.3:1). In fact, the parallel with our night dreams can be very enlightening. When you dream at night, does your mind inhabit the body of the figure you think you are while you are dreaming? No, the dream figure is simply a thought playing out across the mind's screen, as long as your mind chooses to continue to sleep and dream. The body of the dream figure is not alive, it only seems to be alive and real while you continue to dream (T-27.VIII.4). Upon awakening, it vanishes, as if it never existed at all, although it may be held in your memory, perhaps for only a fleeting moment. Jesus is telling us that our waking \"life\" is as much a dream as our sleeping dreams, and the self we think we are as much an imaginary figure as the self in our sleeping dreams, existing only in our mind (T-10.I.2; T-18.II.5). Granted that may not be our experience, but neither is it our experience while we are dreaming at night, believing we are that figure in our dream. What is experienced as an out-of-body experience, such as the one you describe, using the dream metaphor again, would be akin to some glimmering recognition while you are still dreaming that you are not a figure in the dream but are the mind (or consciousness--they are the same) that is dreaming the entire dream, that everything within the dream is your projection and thus you are identified with the whole rather than with any of the seeming fragments within the dream that have their own seeming separate interests, in conflict with the other fragments and forces within the dream (T-28.II.7:1-4). And so, identified with the dreamer and its total projection rather than any figures within the projection, there can be no questions or needs, replaced instead by a sense of neutrality or peace, for there are no sides to be taken. This whole remains as a symbol within the split mind, but if it is not being used as a defense against the guilt in the mind, it can symbolize the wholeness that is our true reality beyond the split mind."

    "text_input": "Q #850: What does the successful completion of A Course in Miracles look like? I was disappointed to read that Helen did not make it. When I was reading Absence from Felicity, I was horrified to read about the nature of Helen's death; it seemed gruesome. How could this be? One year ago I read about the illusion of sickness and what it means. I was a chronically sick person, but once I believed that sickness was an illusion like the Matrix, I never was never sick again. This made quite an impression on me. How could Helen have died that way when I could remove sickness with a minor revelation? A: It appears that you are confusing form and content by concluding that Helen \"did not make it\" because of the nature of her death. Most people would look to that as a kind of criterion of her spiritual advancement; but it would be a mistake to do so. Kenneth also stated in his account of her death that there was a totally peaceful look on her face. Jesus had told her that he would come for her when she died, and her peaceful countenance seemed to confirm that.",
    "output": "When we use the nature of a person's death as a criterion, we would have to ask ourselves, Well, what about Jesus? His death was rather gruesome if you judge entirely by what appeared to happen to his body. Yet he tells us in the Course that he did not experience it as a gruesome event at all (T-6.I.5). That was the lesson he was passing on to us and asking us to demonstrate as well: \"Teach not that I died in vain. Teach rather that I did not die by demonstrating that I live in you\" (T-11.VI.7:3-4). The condition of one's body (the form) is not necessarily an indicator of the content of one's mind--of whether or not Jesus lives in us. In this sense, there is no way of saying what the successful completion of the Course would look like, perhaps other than to say that an inner state of undisturbed peace would somehow radiate through a person who would appear to be \"normal\" in every other respect. This could be a person paralyzed from a spinal cord injury, the plumber who just fixed a broken pipe in your kitchen, or the surgeon who just transplanted a liver. The beginning of Lesson 155 says of such a person that he or she would \"smile more frequently\" (W-pI.155.1:2). That is all that would stand out, so to speak. There is no way we can know the whole of another person's Atonement path, anymore than we can know our own, and therefore we should not judge where we think a person is, spiritually. As we move along in our journey back to God and our true Self, Jesus encourages us to approach everything in our lives as classrooms in which we can gradually and gently learn that everything outside Heaven, including our individual selves, is an illusion. Thus, when we are sick or even dying, Jesus can guide us through that experience to help us learn that the peace in our minds cannot be affected by anything of the body. What a valuable lesson! He starts with wherever we are at, whatever the condition of our bodies, and he just invites us to ask him in as our teacher. That is the way most of us learn. As your experience testifies, though, we can also learn in one instant that our bodies are completely under the control of our minds, and then there would no longer be any symptoms, unless the mind chose to use the body that way. That is not necessarily an indicator of spiritual advancement, though. We do have very powerful minds, and our bodies do only what our minds tell them to do; but the completion of our Atonement path involves much more than that. #262 discusses the suffering and death of enlightened beings, along with other pertinent issues about death."

    "text_input": "Q #851: It seems that what I experience as \"anxiety attacks\" have gotten much worse since I started working with A Course in Miracles again (after a 10-year hiatus). These attacks are so intensely frightening and so difficult to describe in words; they are utterly paralyzing. It's as if I am totally engulfed by the blackest of clouds; or standing in a sea of black morass pulling me down into an abyss of despair. The Course feels like insanity itself; it feels as if I am going crazy. My brain seems to quit working. Cries to the Holy Spirit for help seem to be unheard; then I get angry at Him and am convinced that this is all one big hoax--an exercise in supreme denial of what's happening in this world, and to me. The confusion is so total and I can't seem to regain my bearings. These episodes can last anywhere from hours to days (sometimes weeks, months, even years); medical intervention (antidepressants, therapy) has never helped me for long. I have never gotten to the bottom of this no matter how often I ask to show it to me; that I am willing to look at it. Nothing. Just continuously more of it. And doing the lessons feels like a joke. Is it really possible that the ego is fighting for its survival in this manner? I keep assuring it that it's not going to be killed, just its role will be reversed (\"be the ego's master, not its servant\"). Makes no difference. A: Anxiety, intensely uncomfortable as it may be, is simply one of the ego's many defenses to preserve itself. It's really no different in purpose from anger, depression, boredom, guilt, or any of the other myriad of emotions we experience in our lives as bodies (e.g., W-pI.5.1:3-4). A few things to consider. Although your experience is that you have the willingness to get to the bottom of the anxiety but that your pleas to be shown are to no avail, there is really no one other than yourself who can bring the buried thoughts into your awareness--not Jesus, not the Holy Spirit, not anyone. The role of Jesus or the Holy Spirit is to look with you at what you allow into your awareness, but they play no active role in uncovering the contents of the unconscious. Your part in this process, as well as the Holy Spirit's, is clearly described in the following passage:",
    "output": "\"The Holy Spirit asks of you but this; bring to Him every secret you have locked away from Him. Open every door to Him, and bid Him enter the darkness and lighten it away. At your request He enters gladly. He brings the light to darkness if you make the darkness open to Him. But what you hide He cannot look upon. He sees for you, and unless you look with Him He cannot see. The vision of Christ is not for Him alone, but for Him with you. Bring, therefore, all your dark and secret thoughts to Him, and look upon them with Him. He holds the light, and you the darkness. They cannot coexist when both of You together look on them. His judgment must prevail, and He will give it to you as you join your perception to His\" (T-14.VII.6; italics added). You must uncover the dark and secret thoughts yourself and bring them to His Light, where you can then look upon them together and see them vanish. So it may be helpful to acknowledge that you are the one who is responsible for bringing the darkness to the light, and that experiencing anxiety attacks is more preferable to you right now than getting in touch with what you believe lies beneath the anxiety. There is nothing wrong with this and it would simply be an honest acknowledgment that the power of decision, as always, is yours and no one else's (T-8.IV.5:7- 14; T-14.III.4:3). Another thing to consider is that the Course is leading to much more than a role reversal for the ego, and whether you are consciously aware of this or not, at some level your ego is. If you continue to follow the path that the Course is leading you along, at the very end of that journey the ego will not simply become more amenable to your control, but it will literally disappear, and with it the self that you currently believe you are. Now this does not happen until the completion of the forgiveness process, but the ego, with which you are identified, believes it is literally fighting for its life, although, as you say, it is not that the ego will be killed or annihilated. You will simply come to recognize its nothingness (C-2.2:1-2). But while you remain identified with the ego, you too must experience great anxiety or fear at what the implications are of the Course's message. Finally, you want to be sure that you're not pushing yourself to study the Course if you are simply not ready for it yet. Near the end of the text, Jesus cautions, \"And if you find resistance strong and dedication weak, you are not ready. Do not fight yourself\" (T-30.I.1:6-7). The Course should be a gentle process, but our resistance can make it seem frightening, even painful. So first of all, be gentle with yourself. A couple of previous Questions #155 and #355, addressed the issue of panic attacks, which have some observations that could be helpful. In addition, Question #144 offers some thoughts on anxiety from the Course's perspective."

    "text_input": "Q #852: Referring to \"Redemption must be one\" (W-pII.295.1:4), I ask how Jesus or any \"individual\" can be outside the dream while the rest of us are inside the dream. It seems that Jesus' success in relinquishing his \"ego\" would have been accomplished for all of us. Yet here in the dream we remain. A: Yes, \"here in the dream we remain,\" as long as we choose to stay asleep. Meanwhile, the truth is we are all awake with Jesus, who represents the part of the mind that is \"outside the dream.\" The difference for him is that he identifies only with this part of the mind, while those who sleep choose to identify with the ego. Moreover, there is no \"individual\" who is awake, because awakening means acceptance of the oneness of God's Son. It is a choice for the truth of oneness rather than for the separation of the ego. Neither is anyone actually \"inside the dream.\" For example, although you may dream of roaming the hills of Tuscany during a nocturnal dream, you know as you awake that you were not in Tuscany at all. The problem is not that we dream, but that we identify with the figure in the dream and all the events of the dream. This is a purposeful choice, the goal of which is to be separate and special, reflecting the mind's decision to say no to the Identity God gave His Son. In reality there is no distinction between Jesus and \"the rest of us.\" Oneness is oneness and there we all remain. What keeps this from awareness is the decision to believe that separation offers \" something more than everything, as if a part of it were separated off and found where all the rest of it is not\" (T-29.VII.2:3). The \"something\" is specialness. That is what is chosen, cherished, and preferred to redemption, and what distinguishes us from Jesus. He did not actually",
    "output": "relinquish the ego. He is the name given to the part of the mind of the Sonship that never bought into the idea of the separation in the first place: \"The man [Jesus] was an illusion, for he seemed to be a separate being, walking by himself, within a body that appeared to hold his self from Self, as all illusions do ... he saw the false without accepting it as true\" (C-5.2:3,5). When the \"tiny, mad idea\" (T-27.VIII.6:2) seemed to occur, part of the mind knew all along that it was impossible. This part of the mind was not obliterated by the sleep of separation. That is why Jesus tells us: \"When I said 'I am with you always,' I meant it literally. I am not absent to anyone in any situation\" (T-7.III.1:7-8). Thus, returning to the example of the nocturnal dream in Tuscany, you carry into the dream a sense (memory) of who you are. You do not dream that you are Napoleon roaming the hills, nor do you leave your bed for the trip. Nothing actually happens, although during the dream it seems very real: \"You recognize from your own experience that what you see in dreams you think is real while you are asleep. Yet the instant you waken you realize that everything that seemed to happen in the dream did not happen at all. You do not think this strange, even though all the laws of what you awaken to were violated while you slept\" (T-10.I.2:3-5). Our analogy ends with the significant distinction that the dream of separation is the result of a choice in the mind, and the projection of guilt for that choice. To defend its choice for separation, the mind denies its power by making a body where external agents seem to be the cause of everything that happens from birth to death. The dream's script, therefore, begins with the cry: \"I don't know how I got here, and it is not my fault that I'm here!\" Jesus' message from outside the dream is to tell us, first of all, that we are not really here, and secondly that it is our choice to believe that we are. It is resistance to hearing and accepting his message that leads to diversionary considerations, such as the \"unfairness\" of Jesus' envious position as the first to make it out of the dream, leaving us behind. Most likely he is aware of our \"mild irritation\" with him for this, and so he tells us: \"There is nothing about me that you cannot attain. I have nothing that does not come from God. The difference between us now is that I have nothing else\" (T- 1.II.3:10-12). Our goal, therefore, is to join with Jesus in our oneness by undoing our belief that we have what does not come from God, i.e., separation/ specialness. His loving message in A Course in Miracles that the mind that chose separation can choose differently is all the help we need to reach beyond the dream to the truth of our awakening. Jesus quiets every fear that we have been left out of his redemption: \"My mind will always be like yours, because we were created as equals. It was only my decision that gave me all power in Heaven and earth. My only gift to you is to help you make the same decision\" (T-5.II.9:1-3)."

    "text_input": "Q #853: Chapter 4 of \"All Are Called,\" Volume I, in The Message of A Course in Miracles, goes through a lengthy description of our three selves. I got bogged down several times trying to \"cut to the chase.\" Please tell me if I got it right: self A is the holy Son of God who for a brief moment freaked out and thereby was no longer a whole. As a result, self A realized that he was now in the land of good and evil and felt guilty for that. Next, self A figured out that if he blamed somebody else--self B--then he wouldn't feel guilt any more. So self B became an innocent victim of self A. Self C becomes the victim of the body and hates everybody. And around and around it goes?",
    "output": "A valiant effort, but let's see if we can get a little more clarity on this central part of the ego's myth of separation and sin, as uncovered in the Course. The description of the three selves you refer to in Chapter 4 of The Message of A Course in Miracles, Vol. I, is actually an extension to the level of the world and individual bodies of what was presented in Chapter 2 to explain the initial A-B-C split at the level of thought in the mind, prior to the projection of bodies and the world. And so it is there, in the mind, that we need to begin, if what you refer to in Chapter 4 is going to make any sense. Beginning then at the level of mind, self A is not the holy Son of God, but an illusory thought of a separate self that we as the sleeping Son believe we have wrested from God when we wanted the separation from Him to be real. It is a fiction we have made up in our feverish ego dream and identified with, calling it ourselves. And this separate self is the original home of sin and guilt, according to the ego's story, because its life came selfishly at God's expense, destroying His Oneness to bring itself into a separate, autonomous existence. At this point in the Son's delusional mind, there is nothing else--no land that self A seems to occupy, no world, and no other self. Now to deal with the immense guilt his ego says is real over destroying God Himself, yes, the Son as self A would like to blame someone else, to dump the guilt elsewhere. But there is no one else to blame, no other self. So the solution, drawing on the only dynamic available in the Son's split mind--the thought of separation--is to separate self A into two selves, B and C, identifying with self B and pushing all the guilt onto self C. Self C, in the Son's insane imagination, now becomes the angry wrathful God who is going to punish the Son, self B, for his sin against Him. But of course, the sin and guilt in self C, now seen as separate from self B, are nothing other than the sin and guilt of self A, split off. But this is what enables the Son, now identified with self B, to believe that the guilt is no longer in him, that he is now \"innocent.\" All of this is as much a delusional fantasy as the initial making of self A. And so self A has seemed to vanish from the scene, leaving only self B and self C in the mind. As the Son we are now identified with the \"innocent\" self B, who is the potential victim of self C, in whom all the sin and guilt now reside. Again, this is all happening only at the level of thought. For the drama to play out and allow us to convince ourselves that we are truly \"innocent\" victims, we need a world of time and space and, in particular, bodies. For bodies are vulnerable and weak, and demonstrate quite convincingly that we are powerless to change in any significant way what happens to us--clear-cut criteria for victimhood. And so the mind seems to fragment into millions of pieces, but each fragment retains that same progression from a guilty self A to an innocent self B, with all the guilt now residing in a guilty self C, the self split off from self A that we no longer identify with. And every fragment in the Son's mind seems to play out this conflict, now projected from the mind onto the screen of the world, each desperately attempting to affirm its innocence by demonstrating everyone else's guilt. And you need a body to be able to point the finger of blame. Except that every fragment is trying to play the same blame game. And so to ourselves, we are each an innocent self B, but to everyone else, we're another victimizing self C. And the guilt is swapped back and forth, but its reality is never questioned. It is only when we can shift our identification away from the B-C split in the world back to the guilty but forgotten self A in the mind that we can begin to look at our own guilt, which has nothing to do with the seeming relationship between B and C in the world. For they are only shadows of the thought of guilt in the mind. And when we return our attention to the illusory self A in the mind, we can at last begin to question the reality of the guilt. It is through this process of recognizing first where the guilt originates, and then questioning its reality, which is what the Course means by forgiveness, that we begin to remember the truly innocent self A' that we all share (see chapter 5 of Volume I of The Message). At the same time, while we still remain identified with the body in the world, we will begin to see self B' and self C' as the same, rather than as different--both caught in an insane thought system, believing that guilt is real and desperately looking to escape it. Over time, as we practice forgiveness, we will identify more and more with the innocent self A', a reflection of our true Self as Christ, Who has nothing to do with any As or Bs or Cs. For additional discussion of the splits in the mind which are expressed in the world, see Questions #176 and #630."

    "text_input": "Q #854: I come from a completely non-religious background and was never \"involved\" with God in any way, form or fashion until I \"met\" A Course in Miracles (for which I am so grateful). I am \"stuck\" on Lesson 41 \"God goes with me wherever I go.\" I've been doing this lesson daily for about a week now because the concept fascinates me so, but despite the diligent practicing as set forth, I have not \"reached\" God in any sense, although the Course tells me that it is quite possible to do so. It also says: \"The way will open, if you believe that it is possible\" (W- pI.41.8:4) I want to believe, but how does one do that?",
    "output": "Another of way of stating the content of this lesson is: \"the separation never happened, and we remain with God.\" We cannot truly be anywhere else, and that is why God is with us. However, there is a very important message in the first line in the fifth paragraph: \"We understand that you do not believe all this\" (W-pI.41.5:1). With this single statement, Jesus explains the \"stuckness\" almost everyone experiences in the practice of the workbook. The first goal of the lesson, therefore, is to help us realize that we do not believe what it says. We learn by contrast just how much we do believe the ego and do not believe the Holy Spirit, which is one of the important goals of the workbook. A necessary part of the learning process is arriving at precisely the dilemma you describe: the message of the Course inspires us, yet despite diligent practice nothing seems to happen, but we are assured it can be accomplished. The usefulness of this situation is learning to appreciate the intensity of resistance and the full scope of attachment to the ego's belief system. Without this clear recognition, real progress is impossible because the ego's best game is denial. Its life depends on the belief that the body is our true identity, which in turn rests on the denial of the mind's existence, not to mention its power to choose. Jesus tells us early in the text: \"Few appreciate the real power of the mind, and no one remains fully aware of it all the time. However, if you hope to spare yourself from fear [guilt, separation] there are some things you must realize, and realize fully. The mind is very powerful, and never loses its creative force\" (T-2.VI.9:3-5). Finding it difficult to experience God with you is a way to get in touch with the choice in the mind to believe in the reality of the separation, and to identify with the ego thought system. This choice has made the world and the body real in our experience, thereby making God unreal. The mind cannot hold the thought of separation and the thought of God at the same time. Thus, identity with the ego/body and the guilt that accompanies this choice keep the memory of God from awareness. In fact, it is an attack on God: \"If the ego is the symbol of the separation, it is also the symbol of guilt. Guilt is more than merely not of God. It is the symbol of attack on God\" (T-5.V.2:8-10). When guilt is gone, God is there. Guilt is relinquished through the process of forgiveness, which begins with the willingness to look at the ego in our lives in light of the principle of projection of guilt. This important principle of the Course tells us that everything we experience in the world is the result of the mind's projection of guilt for choosing to be separate, and to identify with the body. This means that nothing outside of our mind is responsible for how we feel. Learning to look at every relationship in this way takes patient practice, because it is not the way we have taught ourselves to interpret our relationships or our experiences in the world. Doing so teaches us that others are not to blame for our condition, they are guiltless. Seeing others as guiltless is how we learn that we, too, are guiltless, which opens the way for us to remember that we are God's Son and He goes with us: \"Unless you are guiltless you cannot know God, Whose Will is that you know Him ... He cannot be known without His Son, whose guiltlessness is the condition for knowing Him\" (T-14.IV.7:1,4). The instructions for practicing the workbook lessons do not ask that we believe the lessons, nor that we practice them perfectly. It asks only that we do them (W-in.8,9). It is important to honestly recognize that we do not believe them, and then forgive ourselves for being afraid of the Course's truth. If we truly knew that God was with us, we would not need the workbook, nor the Course for that matter. The fact that you have become aware that this truth is not your experience means that you have achieved one of the important goals of the workbook lessons: to appreciate the contrast between what you have learned from the ego, and what the Holy Spirit is teaching you in the Course. You then realize how much you need the Holy Spirit's help to unlearn the ego and learn His lessons instead. Practicing each day's lesson as sincerely as you can is sufficient to make steady progress, for that is all you are asked to do. In this is the way made open, because it reflects and strengthens the part of the mind that does believe."

    "text_input": "Q #855: In A Course in Miracles, I am currently doing Lesson 24 \"I do not perceive my own best interests\" (W-pI.24) where Jesus asks us to say all that we would like to happen in each situation, and that some of the goals we have in each case would conflict with each other. I did my lesson and in each subject my goals did seem to be unified. Now I know that Jesus is correct, and I am not questioning that, but I would like to understand the lesson better, especially when it says our goals are not unified.",
    "output": "First, we do not perceive our own best interests because we have split off the part of our minds that does know and that contains the memory of our true Identity. Our goals therefore almost always have to do with preserving and enhancing our lives in the world, because the fundamental goal of the ego is self-preservation. Most of us think that is in our best interests. Now you might say that is a unified goal, but conflict is bound to erupt because bodies are inherently limited and always changing. Our needs are always changing--I might need something from you today, but not tomorrow or next week. What I want from you may conflict with your needs and goals, or with what someone else wants. Today my need might be to alleviate my guilt by forgiving you; other days my need would be to alleviate my guilt by attacking you (projection). Jesus returns to this theme later in the workbook, discussing it in the context of the functions we believe we have in the world--our \"self-made roles\"--these in contrast to our only function, which is to accept the Atonement for ourselves through the practice of forgiveness: \"We will accept the function God has given us [forgiveness], for all illusions rest upon the weird belief that we can make another for ourselves. Our self-made roles are shifting, and they seem to change from mourner to ecstatic bliss of love and loving. We can laugh or weep, and greet the day with welcome or with tears. Our very being seems to change as we experience a thousand shifts in mood, and our emotions raise us high indeed, or dash us to the ground in hopelessness ... The images you make give rise to but conflicting goals, impermanent and vague, uncertain and ambiguous. Who could be constant in his efforts, or direct his energies and concentrated drive toward goals like these? The functions which the world esteems are so uncertain that they change ten times an hour at their most secure\" (W-pI.186.8:2-5; 10:2-4). In the exercise in Lesson 24, Jesus asks us to think of unresolved situations that concern us and to uncover the outcome we want in these situations, then recognizing there are several goals implicit in the outcome we want--\"these goals are on different levels and often conflict\" (W- pI.24.4:3). As an illustration let us say the unresolved situations are: (1) I am looking for a job; (2) My son is having problems in school; (3) I am having a dispute with contractors about your house. The different goals and the conflicts could be as follows: (1) I want a job so I can eat. But on another level, I don't want a job so that I can continue to feel unfairly treated. (2) I don't want to see my son having such a hard time; but on another level, there's an ego payoff to seeing him victimized. There might also be authority issues: I would feel severely threatened if my son did better than I did in school--my self-worth would diminish. (3) Authority issues usually flare up in disputes with contractors or anyone else you hire. You want your house to look nice and be free of defects, so you will be comfortable and others will think positively of you, but it must be done your way; you will have no regard for anyone who stands in the way of your achieving what you want. Everything is to be done on your terms. Moreover, your ego would love the fact that the contractor did a poor job--another victimizer, another innocent victim! What Jesus is helping us to recognize is that adopting forgiveness as our one and only goal would unify every aspect of our days--in fact, our entire lives. Conflict would gradually dissolve and we would go about our daily lives more calmly and peacefully."

    "text_input": "Q #856: Give me a good meaning of Atonement. I know it means at-onement, no separation, but I need a stronger explanation.",
    "output": "At-onement is not a term used in A Course in Miracles to define Atonement. Neither does Atonement have any of the meaning traditional Christianity applies to it, which is reparation for sin. In one word, the Course gives a new meaning to the term Atonement: sinlessness. As simple as this is, it is in fact a very strong message to the ego whose thought system rests entirely on the belief that the Son of God is guilty for having taken the separation thought seriously. Accepting the Atonement means listening to the Voice of the Holy Spirit, Who speaks for God and tells us that the separation thought is not only not a sin, it never even happened. This is the heart of the Holy Spirit's teaching of Atonement in the Course. Accepting this truth is a process by which guilt is relinquished through forgiveness; the Holy Spirit's correction for the mistaken belief in separation. In the Glossary-Index for A Course in Miracles, Kenneth Wapnick defines the Atonement as \"the Holy Spirit's plan of correction to undo the ego and heal the belief in separation.\" Our function in this plan, and what makes it meaningful in our daily lives, is the practice of forgiveness: \"Forgiveness is the only function meaningful in time\" (T-25.VI.5:3). Atonement, therefore, is not just an intellectual concept to be understood. It has life and becomes our life, to whatever extent we are willing to apply the principle of forgiveness in our relationships. This means seeing in every judgment the projection of our guilt for the mind's choice for separation. That is our only responsibility in the Atonement process: \"The sole responsibility of the miracle worker is to accept the Atonement for himself [learn complete forgiveness]\" (T-2.V.5:1). Since the choice for separation in the mind is the cause of what we feel, no one/nothing external to the mind can be blamed. Releasing others in this way is how we learn that we, too, are sinless. In that recognition is the Atonement accomplished. What makes the Atonement a process are the heavy layers of guilt that accompany the choice for the ego and block the Holy Spirit's light. \"It [Atonement] is perfectly clear because it exists in light. Only the attempts to shroud it in darkness have made it inaccessible to those who do not choose to see\" (T-3.I.6:6-7). In the ego's twisted thinking, guilt is the justification for not accepting the Atonement. It would have us believe that we are not worthy to be God's innocent Son, and are thus doomed to remain cut off form our Source. What the ego does not tell us is that this is the means by which the separation thought is maintained, the ego is protected and guilt is perpetuated. This vicious circle of the ego is undone only by the mind's decision to choose the Holy Spirit, Whose message is that the belief in the separation has had no effect and the Son of God is innocent. This is stated very simply in the text: \"Everyone has a special part to play in the Atonement [accepting it for himself], but the message given to each one is always the same; God's Son is guiltless\" (T-14.V.2:1). Every encounter is an opportunity to choose between judgment or forgiveness. As forgiveness becomes the goal in every relationship the Holy Spirit's inclusive circle of Atonement gradually replaces the ego's vicious guilt circle of separation and exclusion. Jesus puts the choice before us in the section \"The Circle of Atonement\": \"Each one you see you place within the holy circle of Atonement or leave outside, judging him fit for crucifixion or for redemption. If you bring him into the circle of purity, you will rest there with him. If you leave him without, you join him there\" (T-14.V.11:1-3)."

    "text_input": "Q #857: I am currently facilitating an ACIM group and was wondering if there is a guide available which relates chapters in the text to lessons in the student workbook! If there is, could you identify it, and /or let me know how to get one.",
    "output": "There really is no one-to-one correspondence between chapters and lessons. The structure of the text is more along the lines of a musical composition with themes, sub-themes, and variations rather than the more traditional text book with subject matter progressing in terms of difficulty and complexity. In that sense, the same ideas are developed in different ways depending on the context of the discussion. Therefore, sections, paragraphs, and even passages could apply to several lessons or parts of lessons. We are preparing for publication (as of February 2005) an eight-volume commentary on the workbook--lesson by lesson--that includes references to the text, the manual for teachers, the two pamphlets (Psychotherapy and The Song of Prayer), and the poetry of Helen Schucman (The Gifts of God). This work is based on the transcript of our audio albums on the lessons in the workbook. This certainly would not be an exhaustive listing of all conceivable cross-references, but we hope it will help students of A Course in Miracles gain a more comprehensive grasp of its thought system and the means of implementing it in their daily lives. Q: #858: You often refer to projection, that is, getting rid of what we do not want by assigning it to someone or something else. In actual fact there is no one out there so projection is just a term that is used to describe an activity of the mind where a fragment of \"creation\" is cataloged under a heading--such as the ego. I assume the ego knows that time does not exist as the ego \"creates\" continuously and holographically to develop multiple responses which address all sorts of causes. We, in our illusory state as human beings, can then access and \"live\" any of these responses and we actually believe that what we are experiencing is actually happening for the first time. If, as the Course states, we are all one mind, then are my ego-based thoughts only accessible to me or can other minds also \"live\" my dream? I know that Heaven is the state where all minds are joined and sharing is natural, but what are ego thoughts? A: We'll address your points more or less in the order you present them: Projection began ontologically with an attempt to place the made-up guilt over the separation outside of the one ego mind (T-7.VIII.4:2-4; T-13.II.1:1). Since nothing or no one else existed as a separate entity outside the ego mind, we as the one Son needed to make up something separate to become the repository of that guilt. And so we split the one guilty self we had identified with into a separate guilty self, called \"God,\" and an \"innocent\" self with which we continued to identify (see #853 for further discussion of this split). This basic dynamic involving a made-up self and a made-up other has been the basis for all further projection, which becomes increasingly complex once the shattering of the ego mind into billions of fragments is undertaken as a defense against the made-up angry God in the split mind. But simply stated, projection is nothing more than a defense to avoid taking responsibility for our own ego thoughts (T-6.II.1,2). To make the distinction clear between reality and illusion, the Course refers to anything that seems to result from our activity with the ego as a miscreation (e.g., T-2.II.2:5; T-2.VII.3:13-15). Although for teaching purposes the Course speaks of the ego as if it were a separate entity that knows and does things, it is really nothing more than an illusory thought system or set of beliefs that our split mind activates when we want to believe the separation from God is real (T-4.VI.1). Time and space are among the concepts of this illusory set of beliefs (T-26.VIII.1:3). At some level, we know that none of this is true, but we have deliberately decided to deceive ourselves to maintain our individual existence. Ego thoughts are nothing. Our seeming lives are based on reviewing and identifying with aspects of these ego thoughts, and while we review them, we have a choice of teachers, or thought systems, to guide our interpretation of what we are reviewing. The only real value in examining them is to come to a recognition of their ultimate meaninglessness. But while we believe ego thoughts are real, we can seek the guidance of the Holy Spirit or Jesus rather than the ego, enabling us to use them to undo rather than reinforce our belief in their reality. In principle, there is no reason any of the seeming bits of separate consciousness that we each identify with could not experience the whole of the ego hologram, except that we have set it up so that we each seem to have our own isolated experiences and perceptions to maintain the reality of separation and individuality. So-called psychic experiences often represent the ability to step beyond these self-imposed barriers within the ego mind. So, for example, some psychics report experiencing what other seemingly separate minds have experienced or are experiencing, as if they were living it themselves. We see this as unusual, but from the perspective of the Course's metaphysical teachings, there should be nothing surprising about it. The psychic ability in itself is neutral, its helpfulness dependent only on what purpose it serves (M-25)--guilt and separation or forgiveness and joining, the latter a reflection of the state of Heaven you refer to, where all that is shared is love, for there is nothing else."

    "text_input": "Q #859: Lesson 183 asks that we call upon God's Name, and to repeat His Name while sitting silently. I need to have a Name to do this lesson.",
    "output": "It is not unintentional that God's Name does not appear anywhere in this lesson, although we are asked to call upon It repeatedly. This helps us realize something we don't want to miss about Jesus' teaching: everything in the world of specifics symbolizes in some way the content we have chosen to identify with in our minds, which is either that of the ego's thought system or the Holy Spirit's thought system. Applied to this lesson, this means that to call upon God's Name or to repeat His Name means to call upon the thought system that reflects His Love. And for us as students of A Course in Miracles, that love is symbolized in Jesus. Speaking in the third person in the manual, Jesus discusses calling on his name: \"The name of Jesus Christ as such is but a symbol. But it stands for love that is not of this world. It is a symbol that is safely used as a replacement for the many names of all the gods to which you pray. It becomes the shining symbol for the Word of God, so close to what it stands for that the little space between the two is lost, the moment that the name is called to mind\" (M-23.4:1- 4). So calling upon God's Name shifts our perspective from specialness, specifics, and the offerings and demands of the world, to the perception of our shared interests and our oneness as God's Son--and that everything other than this is of no worth or meaning. Jesus does not want us to turn our calling upon God's Name into a ritual or magical incantation of some kind, or to use it as a mantra or a formula for success. Set in the context of the entire Course, \"calling on God's Name\" could have no meaning other than to be a means of helping us bring everything of our egos to the loving presence in our minds, beyond the world and the body, and back to our selfless identity as expressions of that Love."

    "text_input": "Q #860: My question comes from two sentences in Chapter 2 of A Course in Miracles: \"There are no idle thoughts. All thinking produces form at some level\" (T-2.VI.9.13-14).  And this seems to coincide with what quantum physics is saying. However I have also heard Ken say the following: \"Everything that this world teaches is false. And even what the new quantum physicists are teaching. The quantum physicists end up falling into the same trap. Because they say that the material world is an illusion, but the thought that underlies it is real. Well the thought that underlies the material world is separation. So that thought is illusory as well.\"  Could you explain the above quotation, and how it relates?",
    "output": "Once we have made the separation real in our minds, there are certain things that inevitably follow, among them the fact that whatever thoughts we entertain will have consequences. The entire fragmented world we see and the separate, individual selves we believe we are have followed from the tiny, mad idea of separation in a deliberate progression, serving a very specific purpose to maintain the reality of the separation in our mind. However, since the initial premise is unreal, everything that follows from it cannot be real either. We may experience it all as real, but according to the Course, only the Oneness of Heaven, the unified Mind of the Father and the Son, in which no division or difference exists, is real. And since Heaven is formlessness (e.g., W-pI.186.14; C-6.5:8), it is apparent that the above lines from the Course can only be referring to the illusory split mind--all thinking produces form at some level within the split mind. The Course is helping us understand the laws of mind that we believe we operate under, but only so that we can come to recognize their painful consequences and in the end choose against the basic premise of separation, from which everything else has followed. Jesus knows that once we truly understand the starting point for the thought system of separation, we will no longer want to keep it real in our thinking. Quantum physics, in contrast, while uncovering some of the operating principles of the split mind, and recognizing that the material world is really a projection of thought, is still entrenched in the thought system of separation. And so, from within that limited and limiting perspective, this approach would have little if any inclination to consider whether the thought that provides the impetus for manifestation in form is any more real than its illusory projections. Impressed with the world--what the Course would regard as our ingenious and complex illusory miscreation --these theorists, if they offer any metaphysical speculations, are more likely to believe they are getting glimpses into the mind of the Creator God, with whom we are then co- creators. And so, the likely outcome is that, rather than seeking to awaken from the illusory dream, we will seek to master ways of \"co-creating\" that can bring about a world which we believe will be more to our liking. And the ego is still safe and protected, for we have not uncovered the thought of attack always implicit in any thought of separation (T-5.V.2:8-10; T- 11.V.13:4-6; T-15.V.2:5-7; W-pI.56.5:2)."

    "text_input": "Q #861: In terms of people who have not developed psychological soundness due to inadequate parenting and childhood traumas (drawn to study A Course in Miracles in order to heal their minds), what psychological phenomena could they be projected to experience as a result of working toward understanding the concepts presented in the Course?",
    "output": "There's a very common assumption implicit in your question that it would be good to take a look at first before we can offer a satisfactory answer. And that is the belief that how we are as adults is a result of how we were treated as children. At one level, in the world's terms, this is certainly true. But the Course does not address anything in the world's terms, except as a jumping off point for recognizing what our minds are always choosing, so long as we remain identified with our egos. It is pretty much the nature of being human that we all experience inadequate parenting and childhood traumas as we're growing up, although the number and degree of severity at the level of form can vary widely across individuals. Until we become aware that there is another way of looking at our situations and our lives (e.g., T-25.VII.8:4; 9:1), we all pretty much feel that many if not most of our problems and limitations as adults are the direct result of what happened or didn't happen to us as children. It may be helpful at first to explore psychologically how we seem to carry the wounds of abuse and neglect that were inflicted many years earlier, when we were pretty much helpless and unable to defend or protect ourselves. There is real value in developing a certain degree of ego strength, or psychological soundness, that allows us to cope with the many challenges of living as a separate self in a demanding and at times menacing world. But getting in touch with all of these thoughts and memories and perceptions is, from the Course's perspective, only the first step in the forgiveness process we are invited to join. For things are not really as they appear! This common childhood experience of some level of feeling unfairly treated or victimized in fact is quite deliberate and serves a definite purpose from the ego's perspective. Now when we say it's deliberate, we are not attributing choice or intention to the young child, but rather to the mind that has chosen to experience itself as a child, physically weaker and emotionally more vulnerable than most of the people around it, including especially the parents. You see, we all want to believe our pain and unhappiness come from what others have done to us. And a major goal of the Course is to help us get in touch with the real source of that pain (T- 27.VII.7; T-27.VIII.10,11; T-28.III.5:1)--a decision in our own mind, outside of time and space, that we seemed to make in the past but are still making right now, which is the only real problem, to see ourselves as separate from love. Each of our lives as individual bodies in this world is predicated on the assumption that the separation from God is real, but that someone else is responsible for it--perhaps God, or maybe our parents who decided to give birth to us. And Jesus is telling us in his Course that we are never victims (e.g., W-pI.31; W-pI.57.1), and how we feel right now is a direct result of the choice we are making in our minds right now for the ego, and not the consequence of things that happened to the selves we believe we are, in either the distant or more recent past. This is a radical statement, with revolutionary implications for our thinking, if we are willing to take it seriously. And, by the way, this does not mean that we then should ignore or deny what we remember as having happened to us in the past but rather, we want to begin to recognize that there is another way of looking at all those painful memories, so that Jesus can help us understand what purpose they have served for us in keeping us mindlessly oblivious to the power of our own minds to choose between happiness and pain right now. And so, to answer your question about what psychological phenomena those of us who have experienced inadequate parenting and childhood trauma are likely to encounter as we study the Course, high on the list for most of us would be resistance. For the Course threatens all of our cherished ego beliefs and defenses that ironically make us feel safe and secure in the role of victim. And so we will not want to hear the Course's very challenging message that will turn our whole world upside down. And closely related to our resistance would be fear, fear that we may be punished for all of our selfish decisions to project guilt and blame outside of ourselves, believing with the ego that they are sins. And then a still deeper fear that we are about to lose the self we still so strongly identify with. None of this is true, but the ego will use any deceit to keep us away from a genuine experience of peace and love. Anger would be expected as well, perhaps at the Course, perhaps at Jesus, perhaps at ourselves, as we will want to dig in our heels and not have to accept full responsibility for how we feel. But with the willingness to begin to look within our own minds rather than outside ourselves for the cause of our unhappiness, we will also be drawing closer to the love that we all genuinely seek, despite having turned our backs on it. And so there will also be experiences of release and relief and peace and joy, as we begin to awaken to the recognition that the sin within that we have thought we must defend ourselves from is not real and has no effect, unless we want it to (T-17.I.1)."

    "text_input": "Q #862: What is the meaning of salvation as used in A Course in Miracles? What is meant by the body?",
    "output": "The Course uses the term salvation to refer to the Holy Spirit's correction for the ego's thought of separation. Early in the text, Jesus defines salvation for us: \"Salvation is nothing more than 'right-mindedness,' which is not the One-mindedness of the Holy Spirit, but which must be achieved before One-mindedness is restored\" (T-4.II.10:1). When the mind of the Sonship chooses separation, it becomes split and experiences itself in conflict between the thought of separation (the ego) and the memory of truth (the Holy Spirit). These two parts of the mind are also referred to as the wrong and right minds. An important goal of the Course is to teach us that we have a mind, with the power to chose between these two thoughts. As the above passage tells us, salvation lies in choosing the right mind, and learning to do so gradually heals the mind of the thought of separation, which is the ultimate goal of the Course. In reality, salvation is already accomplished because the separation never happened. Nevertheless, it is experienced as a process because the mind continues to choose to believe in the illusion of separation. Thus, we are \"saved\" each time we are willing to choose the Holy Spirit/right mind. When the ego is no longer chosen, the mind's oneness is restored. Jesus gives us several statements to define the body: \"It is nothing. It is the result of a tiny, mad idea of corruption that can be corrected\" (T-19.IV-C.5:5-6). \"[It is] an isolated speck of darkness; a hidden secret room, a tiny spot of senseless mystery, a meaningless enclosure carefully protected, yet hiding nothing\" (T-20.VI.5:2). And even more to the point: \"At no single instant does the body exist at all\" (T-18.VII.3:1). However, that is not our experience because along with the choice for separation, and imperative for its defense, comes the choice to identify with the body. In answer to the mind's loss of identity when it decides to split itself off from its Source, the ego proclaims: \"I am a body.\" It is important to remember that although this cannot actually be accomplished, the power of the mind makes the impossible seem true. The mind seeks to escape the guilt for choosing separation by denying its true Identity. It convinces itself that the separation is real because the body, which it conveniently forgets it fabricated, is obviously real. So goes the \"logic\" of the ego. Thus, the split mind is the source of the experience of finding ourselves in bodies, wondering how we got here. It is also the real answer to what the body is, beyond the obvious physical composition. As Jesus tells us in the text: \"Although you are one Self, you experience yourself as two; as both good and evil, loving and hating, mind and body. This sense of being split into opposites induces feelings of acute and constant conflict, and leads to frantic attempts to reconcile the contradictory aspects of this self- perception. You have sought many such solutions, and none of them has worked. The opposites you see in you will never be compatible. But one exists\" (W-pI.96.1:1-5; italics added). The \"one\" that exists is the mind. And it alone is the source of everything the body seems to experience. The fact that \"I am not a body\" (W-pI.84,91,136,199; W-pII.201-220) is the most frequently repeated phrase in the Course (47 times) is an indication of our intense attachment to the body and the need to unlearn this identity by learning to identify with the mind. This is accomplished through willingness to see in the body, and in every relationship with other bodies, the reflection of a choice in the mind to identify with the ego or with the Holy Spirit. The body, which of itself is nothing, thus becomes an instrument for communicating the ego's message or the Holy Spirit's. (See: \"The Body as a Means of Communication\" T-8.VII.) Through its pain, \"joys,\" suffering and death, the body is used by the ego to prove that the separation was accomplished. To the Holy Spirit, it is the means whereby the mind is healed of the thought of separation through the practice of forgiveness. Thus, what the ego made to keep us separate from our Source and from each other can be used by the Holy Spirit to undo the separation. By its choice for or against the ego, the mind imbues the body with purpose: \"The body will seem to be whatever is the means for reaching the goal that you assign to it. Only the mind can set a purpose, and only the mind can see the means for its accomplishment, and justify its use. Peace and guilt are both conditions of the mind, to be attained\" (T-19.IV-B.10:7- 9). Recognizing the negative effects of choosing separation (guilt) experienced through the body, the mind is motivated to choose the Holy Spirit (peace) instead. When the mind decides to see in everything an opportunity to make another choice, the body becomes an instrument of salvation."

    "text_input": "Q #863: Is it not possible that the original \"tick in time\" (sorry to be harping on the famous question, but I can't seem to get past it) occurred not out of a sense of discontent (would not discontent require duality and perception?) but out of a playful kind of \"what if\" feeling on the part of the mind of the Son? Sort of like a six-year-old getting into mom's car in the driveway and while pretending to drive, inadvertently releasing the emergency brake, putting it in drive, and sending the car rolling into a busy street. It just seems to me that inherent in the original impulse could not have been an element of wanting to attack God. I feel that the belief that we had attacked God, and the attending birth of guilt and the ego mind came once we were out in the middle of traffic in a vehicle we couldn't drive, with no memory of how we got there! In other words, the belief in the attack on God came only after we were hurled into the dream by our own inadvertent misuse of creativity. Or is there something I am not understanding?",
    "output": "There have been many, many mythologies throughout the centuries, and in practically all cultures, about the origin of life. Your notion of a \"playful kind of 'what if' feeling\" sounds similar to some aspects of Hindu theology. The myth presented in A Course in Miracles, however, consistently ascribes the ultimate origin of life in this physical cosmos to the thought in the mind of God's Son that being part of God's perfect Oneness was not acceptable. This is articulated in different ways in the Course: for example, God did not grant His Son the special favor he desired (T-13.III.10:2), the quest for \"something more than everything\" (T-29.VII.2), \"a power past omnipotence, a place beyond the infinite, a time transcending the eternal\" (T- 29.VIII.6:2). The Course is equally clear that this was all just a silly thought, \"a tiny, mad idea at which the Son of God remembered not to laugh\" (T-27.VIII.6:2). Sin, guilt, and fear came after the \"tiny, mad idea\"--the consequences of taking it seriously. And therefore the Course's entire spiritual path centers on training us to return to this choice point in our minds in order to give ourselves the opportunity to choose again, this time remembering to laugh, which means accepting the Atonement for ourselves--the thought that we never truly separated from God. While there are many profoundly rich and inspiring theological and metaphysical concepts in the Course, that is not what Jesus would want us to be focusing on, however. \"Theological considerations as such are necessarily controversial, since they depend on belief and can therefore be accepted or rejected\" (C-in.2:4). His purpose is to teach us about how and why we are blocking awareness of the Love that defines us, so that we may consciously decide whether or not we wish to continue on that way."

There seems to be no relief from my anger and negative emotions. All the promises in A Course in Miracles don't seem to have any practical value. Studying the Course is a very uncomfortable, disturbing, and mentally unhealthy way to go through life, so it seems.",
    "output": "Seeing your anger through the eyes of the Holy Spirit means, above all, that you not feel guilty about not being able to let it go. By being upset about your anger and negative emotions you are giving the ego a power that it does not really have. Yes, anger is an ego thing, but nowhere in the Course does Jesus say that we should not be angry; he asks only that we not justify the anger. So practicing this course means learning how to be more gentle with yourself when you discover that you cannot let go of grievances. You have a lot of company! It is not easy, and we are not asked to do it perfectly. Your willingness to let go of the anger is what is spiritually helpful. That there are \"shadows\" surrounding it is normal and to be expected (T- 18.IV.2). If you could do everything the Course asks of you instantly and perfectly, you would not really need the Course. We all have tremendous resistance to letting go of grievances because they serve the ego's purpose of hiding the love that is in the other part of our minds, just as any form of bodily preoccupation serves to block awareness of ourselves as spirit. We are intensely afraid of the pure love in our minds and of our true identity as spirit because we know that acceptance of that means the end of our identity as individuals. So Jesus leads us slowly and gently along his path, which focuses on reducing our guilt and fear as much as we are able to at any given time. That is why it is so important that you not be hard on yourself--or on Jesus and his course--because you are still angry. Inviting Jesus or the Holy Spirit to look at it with you will help you be less frustrated and upset. That is the goal-- simply to watch your ego in action without being disturbed by it. That should lead to more peace and internal comfort, for you would be spending your time in the presence of one whose love for you does not depend on your letting go of your anger."

    "text_input": "Q #865: In #608 you responded to the questioner by saying that if their weight was keeping them separate from other people, then that was indeed the ego's underlying purpose for the extra weight. Can that principle be used as a general rule for other bodily insecurities or conflicts? For example, if someone avoids dating with the opposite sex because of self-consciousness about or self-hatred of their height, eye color, hair color, etc., can it then be said that they actually may have chosen, on some level, to be born with these qualities to keep them separate from the opposite sex? Am I understanding this correctly?",
    "output": "Generally speaking, our experience in the present reflects the goal we have chosen to pursue on another level in our minds. Note that we are talking about our experience--an internal state, not behavior. We need to be very cautious about using the form a person's life has taken as a direct indicator of the content in that person's mind. We cannot judge content using form as the criterion. Crucifixion is normally thought of as a hideous form; but Jesus' mind was never not in a state of total peace; no one was ever excluded from his love. If your internal experience is that you feel alienated and separate from others, then that has to be what you first desired in your mind, otherwise you could not feel that way, whatever your bodily characteristics happen to be. A two-fold strategy (the ego's of course) unfolds from that decision to ensure that you will not be held responsible for the separation and punished as a result (all of this being part of the ego's tale of separation, sin, guilt, and fear), and that you will totally forget that you have a mind that is deliberately upholding the thought system of separation and rejecting the thought system of unity and oneness. So once you make the choice in your mind to reinforce your underlying belief in separation, you would then use the world and your body for that very purpose. You would be intent on showing that separation is reality and that you are an autonomous individual, subject to victimization by others and/or by your own body. We all do this. There are many ways of demonstrating this, but bodily insecurities and conflicts would be high on the list, for you would be preoccupied with your body--keeping you from remembering that the real source of insecurity and conflict is in your mind--and you would have a reason to keep yourself separate from others and be able to blame your problem on your genes, your hormones, your dysfunctional family, society, Hollywood, etc., etc. It is quite possible, thus, that you (as a mind) would produce a body with the kinds of characteristics that could be used to achieve that purpose. Always remember, though, that the purpose chosen in the mind is the critical factor, for another person could have the same height, hair color, eye color, etc., and not be self-conscious about it at all. There are plenty of examples of that, just as there are examples of people who have the \"ideal body\" but are still plagued with insecurities and conflict. The solution to the insecurities and conflicts is to shift from focusing on the body to the purpose being upheld in the mind. And that means shifting from the ego as your teacher to Jesus or the Holy Spirit. Whenever there is shame, conflict, and separation, it means that you are following the ego's guidance. So you would just step back from that and ask for help to now use your body to learn the exact opposite of what the ego wants you to learn. With Jesus or the Holy Spirit guiding you, you can learn to perceive yourself and everyone else as sharing the same interests-- all having the same wrong mind, right mind, and decision-making ability. Eventually, what you look like would diminish in importance, as you would recognize your preoccupation with the body as a defense against realizing you are a mind, as is everyone else. That may or may not improve your dating life, but even that would cease to matter as you progress, for you would know that your self-worth has nothing to do with your life in the body. The major lesson Jesus would help you learn is that you can be peaceful regardless of your bodily condition or your dating life. That is what we are all trying to learn--that the peace of God is always shining in us (W-pI.188), and, without falling into denial or blissninnyhood, nothing of the world or the body can change that. We have to unlearn what the ego taught us, which is that our inner peace is conditional on external circumstances meeting our needs as we have perceived and defined them. Finally, if the self-loathing does not abate, then the kind and loving thing to do for yourself might be to turn to a professional therapist for help."

    "text_input": "Q #866: I have been married for ten years and we have four boys under ten. My wife is separating from me, with a view to divorce. I have betrayed her in my mind out of spite but would never dream of actually doing it as I love her tremendously. I am afraid my wife will betray me by loving someone else, that she will not love me. I have dedicated my life to her and our children, our family, and I do not want to lose her!  Isn't marriage a sacred contract that should be worked through, a holy relationship with vows taken in the eyes of God in Church? I have asked Jesus and the Holy Spirit to look at my thoughts, feeling, actions, and words to help forgive me and to undo all those mistakes I have made and the ones that I feel in my gut now. I have asked Jesus and the Holy Spirit to be in my mind to bring peace, light, joy, forgiveness, love and understanding, but I still feel terrible and scared. How do I get to feel at peace and joyful with life and see my wife without feeling hurt, pain, guilt, betrayal, and jealousy?  How do we or the Holy Spirit undo the mistakes we have made? Do I try to tell my wife everything I'm recognizing? Near the end of \"Practicing the Holy Instant\" (T-15.IV), A Course in Miracles talks about communicating all thoughts pure and unpure so that the Holy Spirit's purity can shine them away. Does this mean communicating my thoughts to the Holy Spirit in my mind or communicating them to the person whom the thoughts are about, my wife, so she can realize I have learned from my mistakes? I would like our relationship to be a success as I really want a family forever. I feel sorry that our children may not be living together with both their mother and their father as I did. Is there hope for our relationship?",
    "output": "There is always hope for every relationship, if you look at it from Jesus' perspective. In fact, the outcome is certain (W-pII.292.1), for in the end every relationship will be healed. But the form of the relationship may not be what we think we want and need, while we remain identified with the ego and concerned with our own special interests. For the healing occurs in our mind, at the level of thought, and that may or may not be reflected in anything that seems to be happening in the world between two bodies. It is only in the mind where any real hope can be found. The pain you've been experiencing as you've been confronted with a major shift in your relationship with your wife comes through your words very clearly, as does your desire to do whatever you can to maintain the marriage. However, from the Course's perspective, you have set up the problem and its solution in your mind in a such a way that you are assuring yourself of conflict and pain, no matter how things turn out. For you see your peace and joy as dependent on what you have no control over--your wife's decision either to leave or return. Now this is very much the way of the world--to see our experience of love and happiness as coming from outside ourselves--and it is doomed to failure (T-29.VII.1). And so even your pleas to Jesus or the Holy Spirit for help are attempts to bring about changes so that your wife will decide to remain with you. The relationship you have established with your wife, like all of the world's so-called love relationships, is what the Course would call a special love relationship or bargain (T-16.V.6-8; T-21.III.1). We come to such relationships out of a feeling of lack or emptiness (T-16.V.9:2), never questioning the reality of the lack we're experiencing. We all seem destined as human beings to have to seek for love and, if we are lucky enough to find a relationship that seems to meet that need, do what we can to cling to it so we will not have to experience the feelings of lack and emptiness again. But, beneath all such relationships are ambivalence and resentment for being dependent on the other, and so conflict such as what has pervaded your relationship with your wife over the years is almost inevitable. But this is how we have all set up our lives. And so, when confronted with the possibility of the loss of such a relationship, as you have been, the feelings of desperation, loss, pain, guilt and anger can seem quite intense. And yet Jesus assures us that none of this need be (T-4.IV.1-6), if we are willing to change our thinking about ourselves, which we can only do by changing from the ego to Jesus or the Holy Spirit as our Teacher and Guide for looking at our lives and our relationships (T-4.IV.7-8). For it is the ego who is the arbiter of the conditions for all special love relationships. And special rituals and \"sacred contracts\" are all part of its offerings (T-16.V.11:4-8; 12:1-3), to obscure the guilt and fear and emptiness that are at the core of its gifts. Now there is nothing wrong, and there can be great practical value in making commitments to another through a marriage contract but, from Jesus' perspective in the Course, there is nothing sacred or holy about such contractual agreements. The only thing that can make anything sacred or holy is its purpose, and the only purpose that confers holiness on any of the symbols of the world is forgiveness, which must begin truly with ourselves. Whether you and your wife remain together or not, the relationship can always be made holy by being given the purpose of forgiveness in your mind. And this simply means that you are willing to withdraw judgment and blame from both of you and forgive yourself for wanting to see her as somehow responsible for your happiness. True love and happiness can only be found by joining in our minds with Jesus or the Holy Spirit and releasing our investment in the guilt and lack of the ego. And this is how all our little mistakes are undone with the Holy Spirit. For the only mistake that ever has to be undone is our choice for the ego, however that choice may be expressed in the relationship. The specific mistakes and self-judgments can be brought to the Holy Spirit or Jesus for healing, where they can be recognized simply as faulty choices and not sins deserving of punishment (T-19.II.6; T-19.III.4). Once you have released the underlying guilt associated with all your self-condemnation, you may or may not be guided to share some of the specifics with your wife. But you will have no need to use any of it to try to change the nature of your relationship with her. For in your mind, as you continue to practice forgiveness, you will become increasingly aware that you already have the love that you thought you had needed to seek from her. And if you should feel guided to say anything to your wife, it would be only because it could be helpful to her. For we are never the ones who can judge what is truly helpful for anyone, including ourselves (M-29.2). And so, regardless of the form of the relationship in the world, Jesus assures us that every relationship can become holy. And it does not depend on what the other person says or does or thinks, but only on which teacher we have chosen in our own mind. And given the gifts the Holy Spirit holds out to us, how could we want anything else? \"Before a holy relationship there is no sin. The form of error is no longer seen, and reason, joined with love, looks quietly on all confusion, observing merely, 'This was a mistake.' And then the same Atonement you accepted in your relationship corrects the error, and lays a part of Heaven in its place. How blessed are you who let this gift be given! Each part of Heaven that you bring is given you. And every empty place in Heaven that you fill again with the eternal light you bring, shines now on you. The means of sinlessness can know no fear because they carry only love with them\" (T-22.VI.5)."

Also, being a 12-step program attendee, if I talk about the problem I seem to be having in a meeting so I can look at it, is that making the problem real? Or, again, am I seriously looking at the guilt? My intention is to use that forum to look with the Holy Spirit at the problem. Hearing myself say it out loud in front of other people seems to help look at it. It begins to seem trivial and lose its power there, I think.",
    "output": "If you're spending that much time on the perceived problem, more than likely, you're focusing on the wrong problem or, more accurately, the pseudo-problem rather than the real problem. You see, whatever seems to be a problem in our lives upon which we lavish so much concern and attention is always a smokescreen, to keep us from getting in touch with the underlying problem in our mind (W-pI.79). And this is true regardless of whether the focus is on someone else or on ourselves, that is, the self we think we are. Our problems can seem so complex, with so many angles to consider, so many layers to work through, so many insights to pursue, before we can really understand and let go, release, \"forgive.\" And yet, we are remaining entrenched in the ego thought system, never really stepping outside it, simply rearranging the furniture on the Titanic, as one of our staff members once so aptly put it. Because Jesus is well aware of our tendency to try to solve problems at the wrong level, in A Course in Miracles he cautions us: \"If you believe you understand something of the 'dynamics' of the ego, let me assure you that you understand nothing of it. For of yourself you could not understand it. The study of the ego is not the study of the mind. In fact, the ego enjoys studying itself, and thoroughly approves the undertakings of students who would 'analyze' it, thus approving its importance. Yet they but study form with meaningless content. For their teacher is senseless, though careful to conceal this fact behind impressive sounding words, but which lack any consistent sense when they are put together\" (T-14.X.8:4-9). The temptation is almost unavoidable to perceive our problems as being the result of our relationships in the world. But that's no surprise since we, as the collective Son, established the world and relationships among bodies for the very purpose of keeping ourselves unaware of the underlying problem in the mind (W-pI.64.1:2-4; 2:1). And so we can spend hours, days, months, even years, going around and around over the same or similar territory, analyzing the specifics to death. One form this can take is to trace all of our relationship issues back to our parents. At one level, this is true, for the dynamics of our relationships with our parents are repeated in all of the relationships we experience throughout the rest of our lives. But if our focus is on how the limitations of the parenting we experienced as children are at the root of all our problems in later life, we have not really gone far enough back, or more accurately, deep enough (for more on this, see #861). For even our initial relationships in this lifetime with our mother and father are symbolic of, or split-off fragments of, our initial primary special relationship with God. And that relationship is an insane hallucination that we have made up to maintain our belief in the separation, while holding someone else responsible for the guilt and pain that follows from it. And the specific problems and issues in our lives are only illusory shadows of that underlying imaginary ego dynamic with God. So our focus on ourselves and our relationships in the world is, from Jesus' perspective, really misplaced. Not that our problems in the world can not serve a different purpose, when brought to the Holy Spirit (W-pI.64.2:2-4). For they can become the portals to the darkened vaults of our mind, where the hidden ego beliefs will continue to wreak havoc on our peace until we shine the light of true forgiveness on them so that they can dissolve into the nothingness that is their essence. But so long as we maintain our focus only on the world and our lives here, those disruptive unconscious beliefs remain securely hidden and locked away from our awareness, but still festering in the recesses of our mind, infecting and affecting our every perception. Having said this, please don't think it follows from this answer that you should stop doing whatever you are doing, if it seems to help you resolve issues and conflicts in your life. You just want to be aware that until you identify and address the underlying issue or content--your choice for separation and guilt in your mind--you are not resolving the real problem (W-pI.79.6). And you will find only temporary relief, much as an aspirin can briefly relieve the symptoms of an underlying chronic systemic problem in the body but is not addressing the source of the pain, which will return once the palliative effects of the drug wear off."

This seems to be the most separate state of existence possible in this world! To me, this means that he can never experience what most of us know as special love. There isn't much, if anything, that can be done for him at the level of form, since a safe and secure base from which to explore this world and develop a \"healthy\" ego was not provided at the critical stages of development. I will continue to ask to fulfill my function for him in my mind, which is the highest service I can render to him. It's very difficult to remember that this is the only thing which I can do, but I sincerely believe that it is truly everything. I need your encouragement, but more than that I need you to join with the Christ in me.",
    "output": "We are never in a position to know the reasons others have chosen the particular life experiences they have, no matter what form they may take. Usually, we do not consciously remember for our own lives either. About all we can say with any certainty is that there are wrong-minded reasons, based on fear and guilt, for the specific forms our lives take, and there are right-minded reasons, based on a desire to learn forgiveness and heal. And we can never judge why others have chosen what they have, nor whether or not they are learning their forgiveness lessons. For we see only external form and not the content beneath, at the level of mind. And one more thing is certain--no one needs our pity because of their life situation for, as Jesus reminds us, \"it is impossible the Son of God be merely driven by events outside of him. It is impossible that happenings that come to him were not his choice. His power of decision is the determiner of every situation in which he seems to find himself by chance or accident\" (T- 21.II.3:1-3). To understand what this means, we must recognize that Jesus is referring to the decision-making part of the mind-- the dreamer of the dream--and not to the figures in the world with which we all mistakenly identify, which seem to vary so in their level of insight and awareness. These selves, on which we lavish such attention and care, are powerless, ineffectual shadows of the thoughts in our minds. And the mind never sleeps (T-2.VI.9:6), regardless of how limited or inadequate the body, the brain, and the personality may seem. And so there is no specific answer to why the person you know is living his life in what feels to you like some kind of empty, emotional wasteland. It could be providing his mind with just the opportunities for forgiveness that he needs--you will never know for sure. But regardless of what purpose his life may be serving him, your relationship with him need not be any different, at the deeper level of content, from what your relationship is with everyone else you know. For all of us, identified with our egos, are trapped in our own emotional wastelands, feeling cut off from God and love and each other. The Course has come to let us know that none of this is true. For all minds are truly joined and can never be alone or in need of special love. Our only responsibility is to remember that our only meaningful choice is between the ego and the Holy Spirit as our guide through the maze we call our lives. And when we remember for ourselves, we are remembering for everyone. For we are all already joined with the Christ in us-- we've just chosen to forget that reality. And each of our minds has the power to choose to remember at any moment that we want, no matter how limited we may appear to be as figures in the dream."

    "text_input": "Q #869: Recent events have made me very bitterly disappointed in my country. I see lots of hatred and brutality where others might see righteousness. I see murder where others might see a just cause. While others might cheer the courageousness of our leaders, I see deception and cowardice. My peace has been destroyed and now I am involved in a moral battle that does not bode well. I know that A Course in Miracles says \"seek not to change the world,\" but how can one live in such a world without doing something about it? How can I \"change my mind\" without capitulating to what I believe is the worst in our human nature?",
    "output": "There is nothing in the Course that says you shouldn't do something about a situation in the world. It is saying that having righting the wrongs in the world as your goal will not lead to inner peace; and peace is the goal of the Course. Moreover, to say that focusing only on changing your mind about the world would lead to \"capitulating to the worst in our human nature\" is to miss the point of the teaching, and really of the whole message of the Course. The Course, unlike some other spiritual paths, does not advocate withdrawing from the world or condoning the hateful acts of others. It is trying to help us see that the way we have been going about solving problems in our lives and in the world has been counter-productive--we are really doing nothing to eliminate the conditions that are the real source of pain, conflict, despair, guilt, etc. We ameliorate and mitigate, and we do the best we can to cope with the pressures and struggles of life--sometimes asking help of a divine source to make things better. But the longing in everyone's heart is for inner peace. And that longing is what Jesus is speaking to in this course. He is telling us how to go about living in the world in order to restore that peace in which we were created. But that requires trusting in his way, which means letting go of our belief that we know what is wrong and how to fix it. \"To learn this course requires willingness to question every value that you hold\" (T-24.in.2:1). That is the challenge. So rather than encouraging us to withdraw from the world and abandon the obligations and responsibilities of our roles in the world, Jesus is telling us that we need to withdraw from and abandon the ego's purpose for our lives and the world, and accept his instead. That is what has skewed our perception of the cause of our problems and their solutions. We first need to be sure that we can distinguish between the ego's purpose and the Holy Spirit's purpose, and then with that clarity decide which to accept. Following the ego may deliver some of what we want in the world, but never peace. Following the thought system of forgiveness, on the other hand, guarantees true and lasting healing of the pain in our minds. The path of forgiveness teaches us that the world and the body are not the cause of our lack of peace, but that a prior decision in our minds to project responsibility for that lack is the cause. The guilt in our minds causes us to look for something in the world that we can blame for our feelings of distress and fury (see T-19.IV-A.i). That decision is the problem, which is readily solved by withdrawing the projection and accepting the truth that our sinlessness is guaranteed by God (W-pI.93). So being a student on this path does not at all mean that you would never be actively involved in the world. The difference would be in how you are involved--in other words, your purpose, which can be wrong-minded or right-minded. If the events in the world, and your country in particular, anger you and destroy your peace of mind, then you can be sure that you chose the ego's interpretation, the premise of which is that the separation is real, the duality of good and evil is real, and the perpetrators of evil should be punished and destroyed. You have forgotten that your only responsibility is to accept the Atonement for yourself, which means you have also forgotten that the world \"is the witness to your state of mind, the outside picture of an inward condition\" (T-21.in.1:5). Acting out of outrage makes the ego's error real, thereby ensuring the continuation of conflict and pain. Regime changes do not end the madness and insanity in the world, as is all too evident today. \"The world was made as an attack on God\" (W-pII.3.2:1), and all of us are here because we rejected the eternal peace of life in God. Why, then, would we expect the world to be different from the horror show it is most of the time? What can be different, though, is how we react to it, which is dependent on the thought system we have chosen in our minds. The point of the Course teaching you cite is that when you choose to change your mind about the world, you would then be viewing it with Jesus from above the battleground, and consequently would not take the events in it so seriously, a prelude to accepting the full truth, which is that there is no world. You would first see clearly the world's purpose in the ego's strategy to blind you to the oneness we all share as God's one Son. Then, centered in Jesus' love, which you would know is your own, shared with everyone else, you would then do or say whatever love's extension through you dictated, which might be doing or saying nothing. The key part of this process, though, is that you would not be the focal point. Your feelings and needs would simply have dissolved in your acceptance of your shared identity with the love of Jesus, and then whatever is most loving and helpful to all would automatically come through you. If you were to side with one group against the other, you would be making the same mistake as those you oppose, thus fragmenting the Sonship. You then become part of the problem instead of the solution. The healed or right-minded perception acknowledges the different opinions and viewpoints but does not judge against anyone. Both sides are seen as part of the Sonship. With the help of Jesus or the Holy Spirit, we can learn how to disagree with others without engaging in judgment. Even if we were to take action, we could learn how to do so without it turning into a battle to defeat or unseat the \"bad guys.\" That is our only hope for real and lasting healing and peace."

So I feel quite guilty for having to do this. How can I get to be able to accuse him with Jesus and not with my ego? I'm sure this is possible.",
    "output": "In order to apply the principles of A Course in Miracles to any situation in the world, it is essential to distinguish between form and content. Whatever this person has done on the level of form does not change the content of the Identity he shares with all of the Sonship, as God's innocent Son. As you point out, it is possible to proceed with litigation in the right mind. The criminal justice system is surely one of the clearest examples of the ego's thought system in action. From the authority problem to a vast array of victimization plots, its form is solidly based on judgments of guilt and innocence, victim and victimizer, and above all differences. There is nothing surprising about this, nor is it any worse than any other institution or relationship made up by the ego to prove the reality of the world in defense of its belief in separation. Thus, the principles of forgiveness Jesus teaches apply in the same way to testifying in court as to anything else in our lives. Neither criminals nor the court system has the market on insanity. All people are equally insane in their wrong mind, and equally capable of choosing the right mind. From this perspective, one whose behavior is correct, legal, and socially acceptable may have a mind filled with vicious attack thoughts making him a \"content murderer\": \"What is not love is murder. What is not loving must be an attack. Every illusion is an assault on truth, and every one does violence to the idea of love because it seems to be of equal truth\" (T-23.IV.1:10-12). This is another way of saying there is no hierarchy of illusions (T-26.VII.6). Therefore, there can be no hierarchy of crimes. The ego would have us believe otherwise, along with the belief that criminal behavior has a deleterious effect. Of course there are effects in form; bodies can be hurt, but nothing external to the mind can have any effect on it. While the world concerns itself with form, behavior, crimes and punishment, Jesus' teaching in the Course is concerned only with the content of the mind. Consulting with Jesus in the courtroom, therefore, means seeing it as a classroom for forgiveness by looking honestly at the judgments about oneself and the accused, all of which are based on differences and separation. In this classroom there are no front row seats, and the witness stand is for questioning one's own judgments. Any guilt you may feel comes from these judgments rather than from filing charges. If an illegal act has been committed, there are legal consequences. That is a simple fact that entails no judgment. The facts of a legal proceeding do not produce guilt. Guilt comes from already having chosen the ego in the mind, and judgments are the projection of that guilt onto oneself and others. With attention focused on the mind's judgments, the spotlight is off the accused. This is the beginning of forgiveness, which is how to proceed with the accusation with Jesus instead of with the ego. Thus, in the courtroom, as everywhere in our lives, the goal is to ask Jesus to help us look at every judgment so it can be healed. We will share the Holy Spirit's vision of those we accuse when every judgment has been brought to awareness and given to Him to be transformed. \"If you will look, the Holy Spirit will judge, and He will judge truly. Yet He cannot shine away what you keep hidden, for you have not offered it to Him and He cannot take it from you\" (T- 12.II.9:7-8)."

    "text_input": "Q #871: A Course in Miracles makes it very clear that in order to undo the ego and its illusions, one needs to be vigilant only for God's Kingdom and renounce all false idols and worldly goals. As I've begun taking this idea more seriously and applying it diligently in my life, I find that I have little or no motivation to do anything except meditate and read. If one is truly committed to renouncing all worldly goals and being vigilant only for God, then how can one function normally in this world with a job and responsibilities? What would be the purpose of doing anything in this world, if all \"doing\" is motivated by worldly goals and thus the ego? Please help.",
    "output": "Renouncing all false idols and worldly goals is a matter of content, not form. Renouncing the ego thus means to renounce its purpose in your life, which means your responsibility is to look with Jesus at how you fulfill the ego's purpose of separation in your daily activities and responsibilities. The activities and responsibilities are not the problem; your mind's decision to use them to reinforce separation is the problem. That decision is what needs to be changed, as opposed to changing what you do during the day. So being vigilant only for God means being vigilant for all the ways in which you are choosing against His purpose--mainly in seeing separate, conflicting interests rather than shared interests in your relationships and interactions. Your job, activities, and relationships provide the curriculum Jesus can work with to help you identify your ego choices. Your daily experiences reflect back to you your mind's decisions, which you would otherwise not know about. So to curtail or cease your normal family and business life would deny Jesus the only means he has of helping you get in touch with what is buried in your mind. Meditation is not the primary means the Course uses, although it is certainly not wrong to meditate. One of the sections that addresses this issue is in the manual for teachers: \"Are Changes Required in the Life Situation of God's Teachers?\" (M-9). Jesus' answer to that question is that very rarely is anyone asked to make significant life changes, because this is a course about changing your mind about your life, specifically your purpose; it is not about behavior. He is trying to help us learn how to go to the quiet center in our minds beyond the demands of the body, where we can be \"directed how to use the body sinlessly\" (T-18.VII.8:4)--not to leave the world, but to be nourished in the kindness and gentleness of love, which would then flow through us in our everyday life activities. Jesus discusses this approach again in Lesson 184, where he tells us that the Holy Spirit can use all of the world's symbols to get us to the reality beyond the world. And thus he asks us to do the same--to relate to our daily life and activities in terms of symbols through which we can learn that we all share the same interests, and that our reality is beyond the separate identities we seem to have. We are God's one Son (W-pI.184.9- 11)."

Recently, I began studying the Psychotherapy pamphlet and I have a question about a couple things that Jesus says in there. He says about goals, \"It is impossible to share a goal not blessed by Christ ... \" (P-2.II.6:7), and then later, \"Each one must share one goal with someone else, and in so doing, lose all sense of separate interests\" (P- 2.II.8:4). I'm assuming here that he means any goal ... such as losing 50 pounds? I realize that ultimately, all worldly goals must be renounced to the Holy Spirit, but if a client comes to see me for weight loss and has no interest in enlightenment, then on a practical level, how should I perceive my role and proceed in therapy? I'm assuming that I am simply to help her on a practical level in the way I normally would, but while at the same time forgiving us both in my heart and asking the Holy Spirit for guidance. Is there something else I'm not understanding?",
    "output": "Just stay focused on the purpose of getting beyond \"all sense of separate interests\"--that is the point of what Jesus is teaching. Any interaction at all can be used for that purpose, and all that matters is your willingness to accept that as your purpose. The other person's motive is irrelevant in this context. The content in your mind is to learn that you are not separate from your client, and the form in which you are learning this lesson is your joint participation in the weight- loss project. All that is truly meaningful in this interaction, though, is the joining--that you would realize that you are both the same in your wrong minds, your right minds, and in having the power to choose between the two. That healing of the separation is what you both are calling out for--you share the same problem at this level. At this time in her life, your client may be able to accept healing only in the form of a bodily change, but whether or not that happens is not your concern. Further on in the Psychotherapy pamphlet Jesus says that the goal of all psychotherapy is reached when \"the therapist sees in the patient all that he has not forgiven in himself, and is thus given another chance to look at it, open it to re-evaluation and forgive it ... The patient is his screen for the projection of his sins, enabling him to let them go\" (P-2.VI.6:3,6). That is quite different from the approach normally fostered in the world's training. But Jesus is helping us to realize that our perception of problems and solutions has been guided by the ego, and that we need to see that that was our choice and it has never led to peace and real healing. Jesus thus is training our minds to perceive in accord with his vision, which sees us all as the same."

I also realize that I can not change anything that I perceive because it is something that has already happened in the past and I am just reliving it. Now how is that for a Catch-22? So, on Level 1 I have created a scenario which on Level 2 I then decide to experience. If on Level 2 I try to change the experience which had previously been created on Level 1, then all I am doing is feeding the illusion because what I create on Level 2 is ego based and just keeps me apart from my true identity. Is that about it?",
    "output": "The sentence you quote is based on the phrase found in the text: \"...seek not to change the world, but choose to change your mind about the world\" (T-21.in.1:7). In A Course in Miracles, Jesus is teaching us that we are minds, not bodies. For that purpose, the Course focuses only on the mind. Remembering this when applying the Course to everyday experiences helps to avoid the confusion of form and content. The statement \"...not trying to change it on the level of form\" does not mean not to rescue a drowning person or not to make home improvements. It means not believing that changes in form have any effect on the mind; an illusion is an illusion is an illusion. Therefore, there is no creation within the illusion. The past that is being relived is the choice for separation, projected out in a multitude of made up forms which vary within the same moment, the same lifetime, or from one lifetime to another. As we are told in the text: \"Each day, and every minute in each day, and every instant that each minute holds, you but relive the single instant when the time of terror took the place of love ... Such is each life; a seeming interval from birth to death and on to life again, a repetition of an instant gone by long ago that cannot be relived\" (T-26.V.13:1,3). A thousand times zero is zero, no matter how good the form may be, nor how \"helpful\" certain activities seem to be. Saving a body from physical harm does nothing, because bodies do nothing (see: T-19.IV-C.5, T-24.IV.2). Neither does the body impede the mind's ability to choose between the ego and the Holy Spirit, which is the only decision that can be made. Once the ego is chosen, any experience will be interpreted in support of the ego's thought system of separation. It is not the experience that is chosen, it is separation. That is why we are told we need to change our minds, not the world nor the experience. Thus, the reason you cannot change what you perceive is that it exists only as a projection of a choice in the mind. It may be helpful to identify these levels as the level of the mind and the level of form. Salvation is not found in form, because nothing external to the mind has any effect on it. This is the direct opposite to the ego's belief that salvation/happiness, and relief from the misery of separation can be found in the world. This explains the ego's endless and exhausting search for solutions, changes, and improvements in everything from a house to a relationship, in an attempt to fix the problem where it is not. In this we find a good example of the ego's maxim: \"Seek but do not find\" (T-16.V.6:5). Nothing in the world of form offers happiness or peace. In looking to our minds, not the world, as the source of our interpretation of every experience in our lives, we learn to accept what Jesus tells us in the text: \"Anything in this world that you believe is good and valuable and worth striving for can hurt you, and will do so. Not because it has the power to hurt, but just because you have denied it is but an illusion, and made it real. And it is real to you. It is not nothing\" (T-26.VI.1:1-4). Simply remembering this whenever we are tempted to look outside ourselves to resolve conflict by fixing the world, reflects the mind's willingness to choose the Holy Spirit instead of the ego, and will inevitably change our perception of every experience."

    "text_input": "Q #874: Could you explain what seems to be a contradiction between what Jesus says in the text of A Course in Miracles about special love and special hate relationships being an attack, and what he says in the manual for teachers about \"special learning partners: \"These are teaching- learning situations in which each person is given a chosen learning partner who presents him with unlimited opportunities for learning\" (M-3.5:2). In one of your responses to another question, you said there might even be a special attraction, which the Holy Spirit uses for teaching. It appears then that some special relationships are even encouraged and guided by the Holy Spirit.  I think I am involved in such a relationship. After three years of close friendship, we are now going through the hostile stage, which does seem like it is going to last forever. I know that it is not the Holy Spirit who is causing the hostility, but rather our own egos, but it still does seem like you are saying that the Holy Spirit has had some role in bringing us together. But how could this be if the Holy Spirit does not act in the world? I have forgiven her as the Course teaches, but I just want her out of my life, because her personality has really changed for the worse. But she keeps coming back into my mind, almost as if our learning experience is not over. Would the Holy Spirit still want me to keep her in my life, even though she is causing me so much pain? She used to be a kind, moral, and good person, but now she has become dishonest, and cruel to just about everyone.",
    "output": "Although the language of the Course can at times seem to be saying conflicting things, there really is no contradiction here. Every relationship between two seemingly separate brothers or sisters has been made outside of time and space with our choice for the ego. Every relationship is always made as an attack so that the guilt and sin are not seen within our own minds but outside us, reinforcing the belief in separation and victimization. But once made, that special relationship provides the perfect opportunity with our special learning partner to learn the Holy Spirit's lesson of forgiveness. And so there is a sense in which, although every relationship begins as special, we may feel guided for right-minded reasons as well to enter into and play out in the world of form the dynamics of the special relationship, so that the guilt we are projecting from within our own mind onto our brother or sister can be recognized and released. For we most likely are not even aware of the guilt within our own mind until we allow ourselves to experience the specific form of that special relationship, seemingly between our body and another's body. And that can be very helpful, regardless of how unsettling the interactions may at times become, if we are willing to remember the purpose the Holy Spirit would always give to all of our relationships--to heal the guilt within our own mind so that we can recognize that our interests are the same as all our brothers and sisters. The Holy Spirit does not in reality intervene and bring persons into our lives, although Jesus' words, as you note, at times seem to suggest that, and our experience can seem to support such an interpretation. But the dualistic language of the Course is always metaphorical, and Jesus presents ideas in such terms because he knows they will be reassuring and comforting to our fearful, guilt-ridden mind. A number of previous questions have addressed both the Course's use and purpose for metaphoric language (e.g., see Questions #72 and #116) and the issue of whether God, the Holy Spirit, or Jesus intervene in our lives and the world, sending us both people and lessons (e.g., Questions #42, #25, #250, #286, and #336). The answers will elaborate on what we have touched upon only briefly here. As for your relationship with your friend, it would be very difficult for most of us, identified with our egos, not to have judgments about what your friend is doing and not to want to avoid further contact. But the mistake would be to feel that the judgments and the desire to avoid are justified, based on the other person's behavior. This is one of the hardest lessons Jesus is inviting us to learn. Our feelings of upset and pain in truth never have anything to do with other persons and how they may be behaving, but only with our own unhealed self-accusations. And so we will not truly forgive any of our special relationships until we have looked without judgment at the guilt within our own mind that is fueling our reactions. The Holy Spirit is not concerned with whether we physically include or exclude anyone in our lives. Rather He is asking us to be honest about whether we are including them or excluding them in our minds, for they represent split off parts of our own mind that we have not wanted to accept responsibility for. And so by excluding them in our thoughts, we are excluding ourselves from healing and from the peace that will naturally follow. Would that be the choice we would want to continue to make, once we recognize the consequences?"

Even though I send my love and pray for forgiveness of myself and my ex-partner, I still see no proof of healing our relationship in the world of form. I send him love in my actions and words; I make no demands on him; but he has made no effort to see his child. How do I deal with this pain? How do I overcome someone who is hating me, despite my love for him?",
    "output": "A key part of forgiveness involves trying to let go of the need to have the other person change. This is extremely difficult, as most students would testify--especially in the kind of situation you have described. The pain must be intense at times, with many regrets about the past. But what would truly help everyone, including your daughter, is for you to be at peace, which means seeing this situation as a classroom with Jesus as your teacher. The curriculum is the external circumstances, and the lesson is that the peace within your mind cannot be disturbed by what has happened. The importance of learning this lesson--which is a process that takes time--is that all of your thinking and actions would then come from that center of peace and love, and you would no longer be preoccupied with the outcome. You would continue to function in your roles as mother, etc., but with less tension and anxiety. This is quite different from sending love and praying for your ex-partner to let go of his hatred toward you so he will be a part of your daughter's life. From the world's point of view that would seem to be the best and only solution. Yet, from the perspective of our Atonement paths, we really don't know that. So what would help you most is a willingness to let go of your judgments and your investment in having him change. True forgiveness is not between two people perceived as separate. It has to do only with the relationship in your mind between you and your ego. Shifting that allegiance is really your purpose in life; and through the Holy Spirit's eyes your current situation can be seen as a means of doing that. This does not mean that you would be indifferent to your daughter's needs or your own; it just means that you would approach the situation differently--not from the perspective of victims and victimizers, but from the perspective of people caught up in the ego thought system, looking for a way out of it. A giant first step for you, then, is to trust that by no longer wanting your ex to change, you are freeing yourself to be guided by the love that knows what is in everyone's best interests."

    "text_input": "Q #876: I recently began reading A Course in Miracles. I am trying to stay sober from alcohol and fall off the wagon often. Although I am having difficulties, I have continued to seek for a God of my own understanding. Although I do not understand all that ACIM teaches, I do feel that God led me to this book. I frequently practice being an angel, but sometimes my short temper flares up and I don't act very angel-like. I want to be like an angel all the time so that others will see that God is really a miracle worker. Will your book help me to learn to be this kind of person? What can I do for myself that would help me to achieve this point? If miracles are possible, can God perform this kind of miracle for me? A: Fortunately, what the Course would consider \"angelic\" is precisely the honesty about temper flare ups such as you describe. If you were an angel all the time, you would not need ACIM. Its teachings are for all who are aware that tempers (egos) are alive and well. A temper flare up reveals the mind's hidden choice for separation, and its need for healing. In this lies the foundation for the Course's teaching: the problem is the mind's choice for separation, not unangelic behavior and the solution is healing the mind of the thought of separation through forgiveness, not angelic behavior. The Course takes the focus off behavior and returns it to the mind. Thus, watching yourself have a temper flare up is useful only in that it shows you what the mind is up to. The miracle Jesus teaches in the Course is recognizing that the true source of a temper flare up is guilt in the mind for having chosen to be separate from God, and from everyone else. The guilt is then projected out, and another person or one's own bad temper is mistakenly blamed for the outburst. Seeing the mind, rather than a bad temper, other people, events, or situations, as the true source of any upset is the first step in the forgiveness process, which is the miracle the Course teaches. It involves a decision made in the mind, and therefore can only be the responsibility of the one who decides. As used in the Course, the term \"miracle worker\" or \"teacher of God\" is anyone who is willing to take responsibility for the mind's power and choose the Holy Spirit instead of the ego. Agreeing to see everything as the reflection of a choice in the mind is the way to accept the Holy Spirit. This is the only true \"angelic behavior.\" God cannot make a new choice for us because He does not know that His Son has chosen the insane thought of separation. The Psychotherapy pamphlet tells us: \"God does not know of separation. What He knows is only that He has one Son\" (P-2.VII.1:11-12). This means that God does not know about the world and does not perform miracles. When the Course speaks of God helping, it is referring to the Holy Spirit, Whom we perceive as helping us because we think we need help. What actually occurs is the mind that chose separation decides to choose against it. In the clarification of terms, Jesus tells us: \"God does not help because He knows no need. But He creates all Helpers of His Son while he believes his fantasies are true. Thank God for them for",
    "output": "they will lead you home\" (C-5.1:7-9). When you find yourself behaving in a way that you consider unangelic, the important thing to do is to see this as a window to your mind where you have mistakenly chosen to identify with the ego. You then have the opportunity to ask the Holy Spirit's help to make another choice. With attention focused on your mind rather than your behavior, or the behavior of the person who ticked you off, you will have gone to the source of the problem. It will become increasingly clear that others are not the cause of your irritation. If you are not blaming them, your temper flare ups will gradually diminish and peacefulness will increase. Each time you are willing to remember the power of your mind in this way you are strengthening belief in it, and weakening belief in the ego for yourself and for everyone. That is how the miracle is shared, whether others are consciously aware of it or not. You will have chosen the miracle for everyone."

    "text_input": "Q #877: A Course in Miracles teaches: \"A healed mind does not plan. It carries out the plans that it receives through listening to wisdom that is not its own. It waits until it has been taught what should be done, and then proceeds to do it. It does not depend upon itself for anything except its adequacy to fulfill the plans assigned to it ...\" (W-pI.135.11:1-4). I have trouble accepting this passage completely. To me it appears like \"slavery\" or treating human beings as machines rather than sentient beings with a will of their own. Of course, you would say, we really have no will of our own but God's. But what puzzles me is the fact that we should listen to wisdom that is not of our own, i.e. outside ourselves? How can this be if we are God's Sons and thus His and our will are one? We can but listen to ourselves and follow that. Hence, surrendering to something outside ourselves (something \"not our own\"), seems somewhat unacceptable if not wholly impossible to me. Hence, the whole passage makes me turn my head, I feel it should read rather \"listen to your inner guides and follow that\" rather than \"wait and see and be guided by some force outside yourselves\"? I feel the whole passage is without love and understanding for the human situation. A: This entire lesson, not just this passage, is presented as a correction of the ways we typically go about our lives in terms of protecting ourselves and shoring up what we judge to be our vulnerabilities. Jesus is helping us get at the unquestioned assumptions that are at the basis of all of our planning for the future--e.g., that we are real as bodies in a physical universe that is real, and that we are capable of defining our problems and solving them. Getting us to look at those assumptions is one of Jesus' objectives in this lesson.",
    "output": "A major objective of the lessons in Part I of the workbook is to train us to turn our attention inward to the decision-making part of our minds, so that we would gradually realize that everything we experience originates with the choice we make to follow either the ego's direction or Jesus' direction. So when Jesus says in Lesson 135 that the healed mind listens to a \"wisdom that is not its own,\" he means that that mind that had formerly identified with the ego no longer chooses the ego as its teacher and now listens only to the Holy Spirit. When finally our minds are fully healed, the Holy Spirit's Voice becomes our own--there is no difference--we hear only the one Voice at all times. But it is also true at that stage that the self that could choose between the ego and the Holy Spirit is gone, and then there is but a single Will. The \"human condition\" would have been totally transcended--not through surrender to some outside force, but by our own choice to deny our denial of the truth of Who we are (T-12.II.1:5). We have to try to connect with the point that Jesus is making at any given time in the Course, because he uses language and concepts loosely. The content is always consistent, but the language is not. Sometimes, for example, he is emphasizing our having deliberately split ourselves off from our true Self, and so he will speak as if Christ were different from us. This is reflected in a later lesson when he has us say, \"A while I work with Him to serve His purpose. Then I lose myself in my Identity, and recognize that Christ is but my Self\" (W-pII.353.1:4-5). Jesus thus assists us with the process--which can take many, many years--of disidentifying with the human self we chose as a defense against our true Self, so that we would regain our invulnerable, innocent Identity as God's one Son. It is a gentle process, providing all the help we need to reach this goal: \"Our Love awaits us as we go to Him, and walks beside us showing us the way. He fails in nothing. He the End we seek, and He the Means by which we go to Him\" (W-pII.302.2). Love is our goal and we are one in that Love; but at the same time, the reflection of that Love is here to meet us in our human condition so that we could gradually realize that it is that Love beyond all humanness that we truly want.

    "text_input": "Q #878: Ever since starting to practice the workbook more seriously I seem to have become increasingly more aggressive, outspoken in situations where I should keep my mouth shut, unable to put my thoughts together properly, especially in written form, and all kinds of other \"horrible\" if not even frightening things for the ego. Is this a normal process of \"breaking loose\" and could you advise on how to proceed with the workbook to make the process more smooth and less hurting to other people? Frankly speaking, since A Course in Miracles arrived in my life \"hell broke loose\" so to speak, although I can laugh about it every now and then. But this leaves me somewhat puzzled, annoyed and frankly speaking helpless. Could you advise? A: Something must be working, since it sounds like the lid that concealed the ego's can of worms is off. Although it is frightening, it is a good thing, because healing cannot occur if the sickness is denied or concealed. Having made a decision to study the workbook more seriously means you have chosen the Holy Spirit as your Teacher, which is the most loving thing you could do for yourself and everyone else. It is also the most terrifying thing for the ego. Therein lies the explanation for all hell breaking loose. The choice for the Holy Spirit is a choice for the ego's undoing, which means hell is indeed breaking loose. Jesus describes this dynamic in the text: \"The ego is deceived by everything you do, especially when you respond to the Holy Spirit, because at such times its confusion increases. The ego is, therefore, particularly likely to attack you when you react lovingly, because it has evaluated you as unloving and you are going against its judgment. The ego will attack your motives as soon as they become clearly out of accord with its perception of you. This is when it will shift abruptly from suspiciousness to viciousness, since its uncertainty is increased\" (T-9.VII.4:4-7). The ego knows it is no longer ruling at the head of the class and naturally feels threatened. Thus, the part of you that identifies with the ego feels threatened and is striking out. Although the ego does not have the power to truly hurt anyone, your aggressions against others have the unhappy result of adding to your discomfort and increasing guilt. This is not the purpose of the workbook, nor the goal of your decision to practice it more seriously. While it is not necessary to change",
    "output": "your behavior, understanding the ego's confusion and revolt takes some of the heat off, and may lessen the impulse to attack. More importantly, appreciating the significance of having chosen the Holy Spirit takes the focus off the attack behavior that has ensued. Seen in this light, the ego's reaction is not such a big deal, which will probably make you feel better and attack less. An appreciation of the intensity of the ego's resistance also helps keep a clear perspective on the process. Earlier in Chapter 9, Jesus tells us: \"The ego believes that all functions belong to it, even though it has no idea what they are. This is more than mere confusion. It is a particularly dangerous combination of grandiosity and confusion that makes the ego likely to attack anyone and anything for no reason at all. This is exactly what the ego does. It is unpredictable in its responses, because it has no idea of what it perceives\" (T-9.IV.7:2-6). No wonder practicing the workbook seriously sends the ego into a tizzy. Obviously, Jesus knows the full intensity of his students' fear and resistance, which is why the lessons proceed gently, one day and one small step at a time. For good reason we are told: \"Fear not that you will be abruptly lifted up and hurled into reality. Time is kind, and if you use it on behalf of reality, it will keep gentle pace with you in your transition\" (T-16.VI.8:1-2). The urge to attack can be viewed as a reminder of the decision you have made to choose the Holy Spirit, with the ego responding as \"a frightened mouse that would attack the universe\" (T- 22.V.4:3). It is then your choice whose guidance you will follow. Be grateful when you choose the Holy Spirit, and forgive yourself when you decide to be a roaring mouse."

    "text_input": "Q #879: I seem to have an inescapable problem in following the Rules for Decision (T-30.I). I try to follow the preparation, \"a quiet moment for reflection\" during the day for \"the kind of day you want\" (T-30.I.4:1) so that \"I will make no decisions by myself\" (T-30.I.2:2). But because I seem to be continually caught up in unexpected situations in which I must respond immediately with no time to go inward and \"sit by and ask to have the answer given\" (T-30.I.5:3), later upon reflection, I realize that I made up my mind and then decided (T-30.I.3:2), but only then do I have time to ask and listen for Jesus' guidance. In any situation in which I have prior time to prepare, e.g., making a phone call, visiting someone or receiving a visit, I do, \"sit by and ask\" (T-30.I.5:3) and try to prepare my mind. But my days are full of the unexpected: how do I handle this? At this point all I can say is, \"Jesus--help,\" and hope his wisdom guides me.",
    "output": "Jesus does not expect that we will have time to sit quietly every time we have a decision to make during a busy day. This could cause serious traffic problems, to say the least. The quiet time spent at the beginning of the day is intended to help us set the purpose of the day in terms of content, not form. The question is: will this day be spent in learning the Holy Spirit's lessons of forgiveness, or serving the ego's goal of making the separation real by having all the ego's specialness needs met? Jesus knows that because of his students' intense identification with the ego we will spend a good part of the day doing the latter. That is why the formula in the Rules for Decision includes a corrective measure for the inevitable opposition that will arise from the ego, once a decision has been made to follow the Holy Spirit. Jesus does not expect or require perfection. In fact, in the very beginning of this section in he tells us: \"Do not fight yourself\" (T-31.I.1:7). He knows that by the time we say \"Today I will make no decisions by myself\" (T-30.2:2) we have probably already made a hundred. The point is to become aware of how \"natural\" it is to think and decide with the ego because we have learned its lessons so well. That is why Jesus' directives are gentle and considerate of our resistance. The important thing is to learn to pay attention to our thoughts and remember the morning's question \"any time you think of it\" (T-30.4:1). Remembering the goal in this way, if only for an instant, is enough to bring a different perspective to everything that happens, for it means the ego is no longer supreme ruler of the day. There is no need for anything in form to change; it is the purpose/content that is of concern in the practice of A Course in Miracles. The only decision we make is between the ego and the Holy Spirit. When Jesus tells us to ask ourselves what kind of day we want, it is assumed we want a day that will make us happy. He goes on to tell us we can have the happiness we seek if we learn that our happiness lies in choosing the Holy Spirit instead of the ego, not choosing between A or B in form. That is the message in these rules, as well as the goal in applying them throughout the day. In lesson 64 we find the same message in another format: \"Prepare yourself in advance for all the decisions you will make today by remembering they are all really very simple. Each one will lead to happiness or unhappiness. Can such a simple decision really be difficult to make? Let not the form of the decision deceive you. Complexity of form does not imply complexity of content. It is impossible that any decision on earth can have a content different from just this one simple choice. That is the only choice the Holy Spirit sees. Therefore it is the only choice there is\" (W-pI.64.5:3-10). To help us through the confusion and complexity of the insanity of separation we are told in many different ways throughout the Course that there are only two choices: the ego or the Holy Spirit, illusion or truth, fear or love. In our experience, the choice is camouflaged in the seemingly diverse and multitudinous events that occur in our lives. Applying the rules for decision means being willing not to be deceived by the form of the disguise, but to remember each time there is a decision to be made that the true choice lies in the mind and the two options are always the same. That is how to avoid what seems to be an inescapable problem in practicing the teachings of the Course. It is also helpful to remember that the choice for the ego is reflected in just such complex dilemmas that are intended to impede the accomplishment of the Holy Spirit's curriculum. If the situation seems complicated, we know the ego has been put in charge. The Holy Spirit's perspective simplifies every situation, as seen in the workbook passage quoted above. His guidance is concerned only with the content of the mind, not with decisions related to behavior or form of any kind. Having overlearned the ego's lessons, it seems natural for us to think we know what will make us happy, and being right is high on the list. In this section, Jesus makes it very clear that we will be happy when we learn that we have been wrong in choosing to identify with the body, wrong in deciding to listen to the ego, wrong about being right. Earlier in the text, he asks us: \"Do you prefer that you be right or happy?\" (T-29.VII.1:9). Probably the best part of the day to remember this question is when all the unexpected things pop up and catch us unprepared. These are the things we have not decided upon already, have not braced for with defenses about how things should be. The truth is we don't know how things should be, nor what will make us happy. That is why Jesus tells us that \"any time you think of it\" (T-30.4:1), no matter how much we think we know what we're doing, we should remember to say: \"I want another way to look at this\" (T-30.11:4). That is all we are asked to do."

    "text_input": "Q #880: In A Course in Miracles, Jesus states that we would be too shocked and frightened to find out that there is no dream at all, so the interim solution would be to live a \"happy\" dream with positive attitudes etc. I wonder how can we be shocked at finding out that even the \"happy dream\" has been an illusion, if there isn't anything to cling to or split from? If we are pure consciousness, the realization must surely be natural? What is shocked and frightened must still be a part of the dream.",
    "output": "Yes, the frightened figure in the dream is part of the illusion along with consciousness, the happy dream, the real world, and the process of awakening. This is because \"In reality [the separation] never happened at all\" (M-2.2:8). Although we are too frightened to believe him, Jesus does in fact tell us there is no dream (T-18.II.9:2), no world (W-pI.132.6:2), no body (T- 18.VII.3:1) and no ego (T-9.IV.5). This does not stop us, however, from believing in the existence of the whole package, and actively choosing not to believe the true and natural. Jesus tells us several times that we do not believe his message: \"Perhaps you do not feel you need a course which, in the end, teaches that only reality is true. But do you believe it? When you perceive the real world, you will recognize that you did not believe it\" (T-11.VIII.1:2-4). The only explanation for this insanity is that we are too afraid to accept the Course's message and awaken to the truth. When we are no longer afraid of love and no longer devoted to the ego's specialness, it will indeed be natural to awaken from the dream entirely. Meanwhile, both attachment to specialness and fear of our true Identity as God's one Son keep the dream very real in our experience. Because falling into the sleep of separation was a choice, awakening requires our willingness to make another choice. The very fact that we choose to remain entrenched in the ego thought system is simple proof that Jesus is right about our fear of accepting the true and natural. Our fear is such that we do not just cower and hide from the truth, we are quite actively opposed to it: \"You attack the real world every day and every hour and every minute, and yet you are surprised that you cannot see it\" (T-12.VIII.1:3). In keeping with the ego's upside-down thinking, we have become very good at doing the unnatural and avoiding what is most natural; i.e., our identity as minds with the power to choose. However, in order to defend its choice for the unnatural (the ego and the body) the mind conveniently denies its power and projects the separation thought, making it look like events external to the mind are the cause of the body's seeming existence. The mind then becomes afraid of the natural in order to further support its belief in the unnatural. It has identified with the body and is terrified that it will be destroyed if it accepts its true identity. That is why we need the gentle process of forgiveness that Jesus teaches in the Course. Its central message is that nothing external to the mind has any effect on it, and everything in the dream is the reflection of a choice in the mind. The goal is to restore to the mind awareness of its power to choose, so it will decide to make another choice, motivated by the pain of choosing separation. Guilt for this choice is what keeps the figure in the dream in a deep sleep wherein the call to waken is but dimly heard. Each time we are willing to see judgment against others as the projection of our own guilt for having chosen the ego, we loosen its grip and fear lessens. As fear and guilt are gradually undone in this way, the dream lightens and becomes a happy dream, until the attainment of the real world that will end all dreaming. Only then will the illusion of separation be forgotten and the knowledge of oneness (our natural state) restored."

    "text_input": "Q #881: I have studied A Course in Miracles for many years, but still find it hard to believe that if someone goes out their way to intentionally undermine, attack, abandon, betray me, etc., that my natural reaction to get angry or fearful from the perceived attack is unjustified and merely a symbol of my own guilt. This for some reason doesn't wash with me. I consider myself a genuinely loving and tolerant person, and if I am attacked for no apparent reason, I am hurt by these actions, which makes me fearful, which leads to anger. Where in this cycle does the guilt from being separate from the Love of God fit in?",
    "output": "The Course's teaching on this subject is quite radical. There may be no other system that teaches that we are responsible for absolutely everything we experience--not for what other people do, but for our reaction to what other people do. The basic reason is that before we react, we first choose to identify either with the ego or with the Holy Spirit in our minds. Then our reaction to what others or we ourselves do--the interpretation of actions and behavior--flows from the thought system we identify with in our minds. Thus, if you are identified with the love and forgiveness thoughts in your right mind, you could not be angry at another's attack, even if the attack had serious consequences in your life. You would not deny the objective facts in the world and in your life, and you could pursue legal action if that were warranted; but your internal state of peace would not change to anger. That is the main point. This is an advanced state, to be sure; but this is what Jesus is teaching us. When the ego thought system is gone from your mind, you would experience everyone else as either calling for love or expressing love. No other interpretation is possible if there is only love in your mind (T-12.I; see also W-pII.347, 348). Again, this is a very advanced state--the top of the ladder. Lesson 284 describes the gentle process of attaining this ideal (W-pII.284). Anger is thought to be a normal human emotion; and it is normal on the human level. But the human level derives solely from the ego; it is a defense against our natural state of invulnerability as spirit, God's creation. When we choose against our true Self, we will feel guilty and will have to do something about that self-hatred and the threat of punishment automatically connected with it. That choice is not usually conscious--although the object of the mind training of the Course is to have it become conscious--so it seems unreasonable to be told that our anger is never justified, and even that we are deceiving ourselves when we feel victimized (T-21.II.2:6). Note, however, that Jesus never says not to get angry, and that when we do become angry, he says we should not judge ourselves for it. But if you look at the full spectrum of ego dynamics, especially its goal of keeping us mindless as bodies in space and time--you can see why Jesus would teach that anger is not justified. The ego's major strategy is to keep us thinking we are innocent victims of what others have done to us. That way, we would never think to look within for the source of our problems and pain, and the ego's existence consequently would be secure, as would be its doctrine of separation: I am angry at you--two separate persons! Jesus is helping us to see the insanity of the ego's system of \"protection\"--that we must suffer at the hands of vicious, cruel people or forces in order to be protected from the pain of the guilt we feel deep in our minds--they are to blame, and they deserve to be punished. That is where the ego always wants us to wind up. Our lack of peace is thus always attributed to something else-- anything but our own decision to cherish our individual, special existence at the expense of our oneness, our true Identity as God's one Son in Heaven. It is really important to see this teaching as ultimately liberating and merciful, not some kind of spiritual admonition that squelches human emotions. We are not aware of the thought system of fear that spawns all of our reactions to seemingly outer events. That is what Jesus is helping us with in this course so that we will be permanently free of fear and pain, and rest peacefully in our oneness. \"I am affected only by my thoughts ... in this single thought is everyone released at last from fear\" (W-pII.338.title; 1:2). This is the ideal, once again, and we need to grow in trust that he is right--that we will be okay without anger and judgments. We don't need anyone to remind us that we are not peaceful when we are in a state of anger--that is obvious. But at the same time it seems unreasonable-- risky at the very least--to accept Jesus' way to peace. That decision is ours alone."

    "text_input": "Q #882: What becomes of the unforgiven? Hell?",
    "output": "Yes. However, the unforgiven are not those whose sins are unforgivable, and hell is not a place of punishment to which the condemned are banished to suffer untold agony for having sinned. Hell is the belief that God's Son can be separate from Him, living and dying in a body. It is guilt for choosing separation, and fear that God will retaliate with wrathful vengeance. It is the experience of refusing to forgive oneself for the \"sin\" of believing that separation is preferable to oneness. Thus, whenever we choose separation, cling to the ego's lie of specialness and judge this to be a sin, we are unforgiven and in hell. Both unforgiveness and hell are reflections of a choice made in the mind. The choice is to accept the ego's version of who God's Son is: a separate individual, abiding in a body; sinful, guilty, and afraid of being cast into hell at some unknown future time. The goal of the Course is to teach us that there is another way: the Holy Spirit's. He represents the part of the mind that remembers the truth about God's Son, and through the Course's teaching brings release from hell. He does so by teaching that the mind has the power to choose between Heaven or hell, God or the ego, forgiveness or unforgiveness. In reality, \"there is no hell\" (T-15.I.7:1), only the experience of searing pain that follows making the wrong choice. Release from this pain/hell lies in learning that the mind that chose wrongly can choose again."

    "text_input": "Q #884: Is extending gratitude to the ideas which joined me in my physical, illusory play in the form of body cells and tissues, trees, animals, insects etc., bringing truth to illusions? Or does keeping in mind that the reality of everything is a loving idea, if seen from the Holy Spirit's vantage point, allow the illusion to be brought to Truth? Is focusing on the ideas beyond the form the way to remember, that \"God is in everything I see\" (W-pI.29)?",
    "output": "Guilt for having chosen the separation and identity with the ego are the thoughts that made the body. These are certainly not thoughts for which to be grateful. The body is nothing to be grateful for, because of itself it is nothing (T-19.IV-C-5:5). In fact, there is nothing in the illusion of form that merits gratitude, precisely because it is illusion, not reality. Moreover, the world is the projection of the insane thought that the Son of God can be separate from his Source. Therefore, there is nothing inherently loving about it. What's more, in A Course in Miracles, Jesus tells us: we do not know what anything is for (W- pI.25), we do not know who we are (T-9.I.2:5), what we really want (T-11.II.3:7), or what love is (T-12.V.6:1). In this state of confusion, how could we possibly know what to be grateful for? Hope lies in accepting what Jesus tells us: \"You do not know the meaning of anything you perceive. Not one thought you hold is wholly true. The recognition of this is your firm beginning\" (T-11.VIII.3:1-3). The beginning is willingness to be taught to see everything differently by looking through the eyes of forgiveness. The practice of forgiveness, whereby every judgment is recognized as the projection of a choice in the mind, is the only way to bring illusion to truth. The important focus in this process is being willing to remember that nothing external to the mind has any effect on it. This is the foundation of forgiveness and the perspective the Holy Spirit brings to every experience in the dream. We can then be grateful to everything and everyone by acknowledging that none of them is responsible for anything we feel. That is what is meant by the workbook lesson, \"I am not the victim of the world I see\" (W-pI.31). This gratitude extends to oneself as well, in recognition of the mind's power to choose the Holy Spirit or the ego as interpreter of every experience in the dream. We can be thankful that our happiness does not depend on anything outside our minds, and requires only that we choose it, by choosing the Holy Spirit. The first step is learning that the \"happiness\" we seem to experience in the world is the ego's specialness, not true happiness. This means looking honestly at all the things we think make us happy, and seeing them as tawdry substitutes for the real happiness we seek. As mentioned earlier, we don't know what that is, but we can learn that it is not anything the world offers. This requires a little willingness to question every value that we hold (T-24.in.2:1). Every value means \"all thoughts of what you are and what God is; all concepts you have learned about the world; all images you hold about yourself ... everything [the mind] thinks is either true or false, or good or bad, of every thought it judges worthy, and all the ideas of which it is ashamed\" (W- pI.189.7:1-2). To question these values we must first recognize them, and so our function is only to: \" seek and find all of the barriers within yourself that you have built against [Him]\" (T- 16.IV.6:1). We need not strive to see God in everything. When every value is questioned and found wanting, nothing will be held up to block the memory of God's Love in our minds, and then He will be in everything we see. This does not mean that He is present in the dream in any way. It means that when the memory of His Love is not blocked by the ego's specialness, everything is perceived through the lens of love's reflection."

    "text_input": "Q #885: Why do I sometimes feel that the words spoken in A Course in Miracles are unkind? Is this a projection of the ego which is trying to steer me subtly away from the Course's purpose? What is the Course's purpose anyhow?",
    "output": "The goal of A Course in Miracles is to uncover what lies hidden within the ego thought system, so that it can be exposed to the light of truth to be healed. Exposure of the ugliness of the ego may seem unkind, just as patients cringe when the dentist probes to examine an aching tooth. The pain of the infected tooth is unbearable, but the helping hands of the dentist may be perceived as yet more painful. Careful examination of the Course's graphic descriptions of the ego reveals Jesus' kind and comforting diagnosis: we are not the gruesome ego in need of a root canal, we only think we are. He introduces descriptions of the ego's insanity with phrases such as: \"you think you are ...\"; \"you believe you are ... \"; \"you see yourself ... \". Never does he say these beliefs are true. In fact, the only purpose for exposing these thoughts is to teach us that they are not true, and that we believe them because we have chosen them to support belief in the reality of separation and sin. The sickness of separation must first be exposed in order for it to be healed. The goal of the Course is healing the mind of the thought of separation, which Jesus helps us do by teaching us that just as we chose the ego, we can choose against it by choosing the Holy Spirit. Yes, focusing on the Course's strong negative words in reference to the ego is a wonderful way for to halt progress in your study of the Course. The truth is, we have no problem believing that we are egos living and dying in bodies, with no hope of ever returning to our true state of oneness with God; the most unkind thing the Son of God could believe about himself. But we do have tremendous resistance to believing the message Jesus offers: we are God's innocent Son (W-pI.95.12:2-3), the separation never happened (T-6.II.10:7), the world is an illusion (W- pI.155.2:1), and \"At no single instant does the body exist at all\" (T-18.VII.3:1). Jesus adds insult to injury by telling us that this world is hell (W-pI.182.3), every attack is murder (T-23.III.1), guilt is projected from the mind in the form of hate (T-18.VI.2), and finally, \" a slight twinge of annoyance is nothing but a veil drawn over intense fury\" (W-pI.21.2:5). To the part of the mind that identifies with the ego/body these words are indeed unkind; certainly not things we want to hear. In fact, the ego works very hard at keeping these thoughts from awareness, thereby defending the mind's continued choice for separation. The devastating consequences of choosing separation are hidden behind the world's seeming loveliness. In the text, Jesus uses the example of a framed picture to show us the ego's use of denial and deception. The ugly picture of the ego's specialness is \"surrounded by a frame so heavy and so elaborate that the picture is almost obliterated by its imposing structure\" (T-17.IV.8:2). The ego uses both the positive and negative experiences of the world in fabricating its frame of deception. The positive experiences are diversions meant to convince us that the world is not such a bad place. The pain and misery of negative experiences prove the world is real. We have so overlearned the ego's message and adjusted to the heavy layers of denial, that Jesus spells things out using striking contrast between the ego's darkness and the loving message of the Holy Spirit's truth. Jesus urges us to \"look at the picture\" (T-17.IV.9:1), not the frame. Unless we see that choosing the ego is the source of all the world's anguish, we will not move beyond the veil of illusion to awaken to the light of truth. That is the ultimate goal of the Course."

    "output": "Jesus tells us in the text that \"if you are wholly free of fear of any kind, and if all those who meet or even think of you share in your perfect peace, then you can be sure that you have learned God's lesson, and not your own\" (T-14.XI.5:2). We all would readily admit that we are quite good at deluding ourselves into thinking we have gotten past the illusions of the ego, but it is more difficult to fool people who are part of our daily lives. So Jesus adds the second criterion to his test for determining which teacher we have followed. But this evaluation should extend over a long period of time, not just a given instant, because we are so capable of fooling both ourselves and others as well. A discussion of this may be found in our book The Most Commonly Asked Questions about A Course in Miracles, Question #43; see also on this Service Questions #43, #285, #309, #486, #498, and #536. Practically every student of the Course has wondered about this same issue. The lessons in Part I of the workbook are directly aimed at helping us get in touch with what we have concealed in our minds, so that we can--with the help of Jesus or the Holy Spirit--make a better decision. Again, though, this is a long process, for as Jesus tells us at the conclusion of the 365 lessons, \"This course is a beginning, not an end\" (W-ep.1:1). We need to continue to apply the lessons in our daily lives with patience and gentleness, remembering always Jesus' assurance that we cannot fail. \"Forget not once this journey is begun the end is certain. Doubt along the way will come and go and go to come again. Yet is the ending sure. No one can fail to do what God appointed him to do. When you forget, remember that you walk with Him and with His Word upon your heart. Who could despair when hope like this is his? Illusions of despair may seem to come, but learn how not to be deceived by them. Behind each one there is reality and there is God ... The end is sure and guaranteed by God\" (C-ep.1:1-10)."

    "text_input": "Q #887: According to A Course in Miracles, since everything in this world is a means of seeing either the Holy Spirit's purpose or the ego's purpose, I do hope you can suggest some possible opportunities for forgiveness in my recent choice for a new job. Many feel that my having chosen to be the delinquent tax collector for our county means that I will be promoting the idea that taking from others is acceptable, since my job will involve enforcing laws that require a person's property to be taken and sold at public auction if taxes are not paid. Some call this legal theft. In spite of the guilt feelings this brings up, I prefer to see this job as another way to learn that there is no order of difficulty in miracles. I welcome your perspective and thank your for your comments. A: You are correct, \"there is no order of difficulty in miracles\" (T-1.I.1:1). The companion to this principle, there is no hierarchy of illusions (T-23.II.2), further substantiates the equality of every classroom with any other classroom, your job with any other job. It would be a mistake to think that the choice for a job is dependent upon its not contributing in some way to the perceived victimization of other people. If that were the case, a lot of people would have to quit their jobs and a lot of work would not get done. Moreover, for this world to work on its terms, taking from others is not only acceptable, it is required. Life in the body depends on taking life from other organisms; animal and vegetable. From the womb to the tomb survival means someone or something must die that I may live. This is a \"kill or be killed\" world (M-17.7). The foundation of the ego's world and of every form of employment is the specialness bargain, wherein needs are met in exchange for some form of payment. Taxes are part of the deal and tax",
    "output": "collectors are needed to get the job done. If your friends use roads, stop lights, bridges, or any of the multitudinous things paid for by taxes, they may thank you for doing your job. Meanwhile, it is your classroom for uncovering the guilt induced by the belief that in choosing separation we stole life and power from God, and are illegal aliens in a world of our own making. It is also a mistake to think that some jobs are more spiritual, just, valuable, or important than others, or that \"holy\" people are tax exempt. As we all know, two things are certain in this world: death and taxes. The ego would have us believe that in both cases we are ripped off by very powerful, vicious authority figures (God and the government). The Holy Spirit tells us this is the projection of the mind's insane decision to rip itself off by identifying with the thought of separation, rather than accepting its true Identity as God's Son. Seeing the guilt and victimization feelings that arise with regard to taxes, politics, and governments is a perfect opportunity to see the reflection of the split mind's conflict. It is important to remember that this conflict is present in every relationship, as well as every job, no matter how cleverly it may be disguised. All the pain and misery experienced in this world are the taxes we pay for the mistake of choosing the ego. These taxes must be paid until a decision is made to identify with the Holy Spirit instead. Only then will we accept the inheritance we are entitled to as God's Son: \"awareness of love's presence\" (T-in.1:7). And this inheritance is tax free."

    "text_input": "Q #888: I've been wondering about the dispensing of our sense of guilt. In many therapies, the recognition of our feelings, especially negative ones such as envy, guilt etc., is important so that we can let the feelings go. Yet A Course in Miracles states that ultimately guilt isn't real and that we should not recognize it as \"truth.\" Then again, it states that as long as we believe in the body's truth, we would have to obey its laws that we set up ourselves.",
    "output": "So wouldn't it be an easy cop out to say, \"Oh, those negative things aren't real anyway, so why bother with them?\" At the same time, they are part of our physical selves and might come out secretly at the other end and be harmful to us. We are also living in a human body and--as the Course states, too--to deny that would be an even greater denial of the truth. So if we keep on recognizing the body and its attached sense of guilt, then how can we ever get out of here and return to the true state of mind that is still ours? It seems to be some kind of trap where the door has disappeared. Can you advise? Also, Jesus tells us that we must first live a \"happy dream\" before we can realize that there is no dream at all. However, does not every \"happy\" thing include its opposite by definition? How can we live a happy dream when that implies that there must be something sad as well? Isn't that an illusion? Is that what Jesus means when he says that when we really come across living a happy dream, \"God will bow down to us\" and the bridge to \"real life\"/truth will be there for us to cross? So once we recognize the illusion of distinguishing between happy and sad, good and bad, there is no dream at all. We cross the bridge to truth and the Self that is one with God. Is that all there is to it? A: A Course in Miracles does not ask that we deny feelings. They are an important key to recognizing the choice that has been made in the mind. In fact, the goal of the mind training the workbook teaches is to make us increasingly aware of what we are thinking and feeling. The thoughts and feelings that are experienced in the dream are the reflection of a decision made in the mind that is outside time and space. When the mind decides to identify with the body, it then denies the choice and dissociates itself from its true identity as a mind. Jesus tells us our feelings and hidden thoughts are the guide to recognizing the forgotten choice the mind has made: \"How can you know whether you chose the stairs to Heaven or the way to hell? Quite easily. How do you feel?\" (T-23.II.22:6-8). He goes on to tell us that certainty and peace accompany the decision to turn toward Heaven by choosing the Holy Spirit. Any other feeling tells us we have chosen the ego's road to hell. Therefore, our feelings should not be dismissed. That would be, as you say, a cop out, driving them further under cover and burying the mind's choice in deeper darkness. What makes the recognition of feelings part of a healing process, rather than a trap, is looking at them without judgment, and being willing to see them for what they are, not as the ego interprets them. The goal is not to justify them, blame others for them, or indulge them, but to see them as the inevitable and desired result of a choice in the mind. Acknowledging the mind as the source of every feeling means that the feelings change as the mind is healed. Part of the healing process may involve working with a therapist to bring the feelings to the surface and to identify the persons or situations that were their projected source. What makes practicing the Course a different kind of therapy is attributing every experience to the mind's decision, and not to anyone else nor to anything in form. This means no one else is responsible for how one feels. Neither are feelings caused by anything the body has done to itself. They come only from having decided for the ego and then judging it as sinful. Looking beyond the feelings to their source is how to practice the forgiveness Jesus teaches in the Course. Not only is it not a trap, it is the escape route out of the ego's trap because it makes the power of the mind real in our awareness and diminishes the seeming power of the body and its guilt. When guilt is seen as a purposive and not-so- desirable choice, rather than a powerful force, its unreality gradually becomes apparent and it will eventually disappear for lack of nourishment. A little willingness to see feelings in this light is all that is required to set us in the right direction with the Holy Spirit by our side to \" give [us] certainty of where [we] go\" (T- 23.II.22:13). Being certain of where we go (out of the dream), with Whom we go (the Holy Spirit), and how we go (forgiveness) is what makes us happy in the dream. It is not really about the dream; it is the \"fixed determination\" (T-31.VIII.11:1) to go beyond the dream that makes it \"happy.\" This reflects the mind's decision to hold Jesus' hand and walk with him out of the illusion. It has nothing to do with the distinctions we make as bodies about what is good, bad, happy, or sad. These all reflect the ego's judgment based on the belief in separation and the reality of the body. The happy dream is the reflection of the part of the mind that chooses to identify with the Holy Spirit, Who is the memory of what lies beyond illusion. In this, as always, it is helpful to remember that the Course is using words that \" are but symbols of symbols ... twice removed from reality\" (M-21.1:9-10). Its use of symbols and images is necessary to reach us who believe we are irretrievably lost in the dream. The only distinction we must learn to make is between the ego's voice and the Holy Spirit's. This is accomplished through the process of forgiveness described above. That is all there is to it. It is a simple process, but one that takes quite a bit of practice due to the resistance to letting go of identity with the body. When we do, we will return to the oneness with God that we never truly left, symbolized in the Course by the image of God reaching down: \"And then your Father will lean down to you and take the last step for you, by raising you unto Himself\" (T-11.VIII. 15:5)."

As a student of A Course in Miracles, would it be dishonest to recite \"Hail Mary ... pray for us sinners now ... \" or would it rather be a loving thing to do in accordance with the Course teaching: \"Recognize what does not matter, and if your brothers ask you for something 'outrageous,' do it because it does not matter.\" (T- 12.III.4:1)? Would this exhortation apply to the situation I am talking about?  I am a non-practicing Catholic and have been a student of the Course for the past 6 years. Some of the women I socialize with attend church on a regular basis. I have been asked what church I attend. I didn't like being asked about that, as there is only one church in our parish. So, the first time I ignored the question. The second time, I spontaneously answered: \"Good question!\" I don't feel like answering that my spiritual path is A Course in Miracles. What would be a loving, honest way to answer that question?",
    "output": "You have given yourself a very good answer to your question. It may certainly be a loving thing to say Hail Marys with your friend. There is nothing dishonest in being willing to meet your friend on her turf and on her terms. While your friend practices her beliefs, you can also practice yours by focusing on the content (the thoughts in your mind), not allowing the form (rosary) to come between you and your friend. This could make for a very relaxing ride. Similarly, there is no need to tell anyone that you are a student of the Course. The important thing from the perspective of the Course, is to pay attention to the discomfort you experience with your friends' inquiries, because it reflects the mind's conflict. The goal of the Course is to help us become aware of just such discomfort, so that the beliefs and judgments that are hidden beneath it can be exposed. That is the only focus the Holy Spirit brings. If you are willing to look at whatever judgments you have regarding your friends' Catholic practice and your identity as a non-practicing catholic/student of the Course, you may be surprised to find beliefs you were not aware of. These beliefs and judgments are what make it difficult to discern what to say to your friends about church attendance. Every judgment is some form of unforgiveness and unforgiveness blocks communication. As Jesus tells us in the workbook: \"Certain it is that all distress does not appear to be but unforgiveness. Yet that is the content underneath the form\" (W-pI.193.4:1-2). With this in mind, it is possible to find the way out of every dilemma: \"...only forgiveness heals an unforgiveness, and only an unforgiveness can possibly give rise to sickness [distress, discomfort, uneasiness] of any kind\" (P-2.VI.5:5). When forgiveness of one's judgments becomes the goal in the relationship, the relationship changes, and on some level all who are involved perceive the shift. Questions and answers may change, but it is the change in content that truly matters. In some form, the message that your friends' inquiries are not upsetting to you will be communicated to them. Releasing them of any responsibility for your feelings makes every interaction lighter. Whatever you say will be free of judgment. If you remain a kind and loving friend in this way they probably won't care what church, if any, you are attending. If they do care, it won't be an issue for you. You can't lose."

    "text_input": "Q #890: In addition to the valuable changes in perception that practicing A Course in Miracles provides, are there any Course students who have had some degree of enlightenment experience? Are the Course's teachers mainly talking from the perspective of belief and conceptual understanding (as opposed to direct experience of non-duality)? Given Zen's emphasis on a human teacher (who has experienced some degree of enlightenment) to ensure that the student doesn't confuse progress with ego milestones, how is this avoided in the Course? A: We don't know whether or not any Course students or teachers have had direct experiences of non-duality. There would be no need to announce, really, that one has had such an experience, and having that experience is not the immediate objective of the lessons in A Course in Miracles (see T-8.I.1-2; T-24.in.1; M-26.2-3). There is only one qualification that Jesus gives for becoming a teacher of God. In his somewhat startling definition he states: \"A teacher of God is anyone who chooses to be one. His qualifications consist solely in this; somehow, somewhere he has made a deliberate choice in which he did not see his interests as apart from someone else's\" (M-1.1:1-2). That is the only qualification, which actually is one of the major themes running through the entire Course. Learning to perceive each other and relate to each other in the context of the common purpose we all share as God's one Son--now fragmented, but desirous of returning home to our oneness in God--is the means of approaching the non-dualism of reality. The perception that we all share the same mind--wrong mind, right mind, and decision-making power--reflects the ultimate ontological non-dualism of reality. We are both drawn to the truth and terrified of it; attracted to union and terrified of being without our individual identity. Believing we are individual, separate human beings, we would have to be terrified of pure Oneness; and if we weren't, we would not need the Course or any other spiritual path. Therefore, abstract Oneness must be represented and taught in a form that we can understand and accept. We need teachers who can communicate to us on our level, recognizing our tremendous fear and resistance to letting go of our individual self. They must use the language and symbols of the world of separation and individuality to gently and gradually lead us beyond it (see T-25.I.5-7; W-pI.184.9-11). One form in which that need is met is Jesus and this course. Teaching in A Course in Miracles is thought of in an entirely different light from what is typically thought of in the world as teaching. In the manual for teachers Jesus tells us that his course \"emphasizes that to teach is to learn, so that teacher and learner are the same\"; and he continues with this important description of teaching: \"To teach is to demonstrate. There are only two thought systems, and you demonstrate that you believe that one or the other is true all the time. From your demonstration others learn, and so do you\" (M-in.1:5; 2:1-3). The Course says virtually nothing about the formal classroom-type situation, but a great deal about the content that is taught, and how it is taught: \" ... the content of the course never changes. Its central theme is always, 'God's Son is guiltless, and in his innocence is his salvation.' It can be taught by actions or thoughts; in words or soundlessly; in any language or in no language; in any place or time or manner\" (M-1.3:4-6). A student, therefore, does not have to be in a formal classroom to learn this course. Jesus stresses only the need to develop a relationship with the Teacher within our minds Who reflects to us the abstract truth of Heaven. In view of all this, if you are in a class on A Course in Miracles, you are going to learn either that separation is reality or that oneness is reality; that separate interests are valued or that shared",
    "output": "interests are the only value. That is what will be communicated, regardless of the words, teaching aids, and techniques used--and regardless of how well versed the instructor/facilitator is on the thought system of the Course. In the text, Jesus talks about \"right teaching and right learning\" (T-4.I), and there he warns about the \"ego-oriented\" teacher who \"is concerned with the effect of his ego on other egos, and therefore interprets their interaction as a means of ego preservation. I would not be able to devote myself to teaching if I believed this, and you will not be a devoted teacher as long as you believe it\" (T-4.I.6:4-6). This is a helpful guideline that alerts us to the ways in which specialness can creep into the teaching/learning situation. But it is only after considerable practice in monitoring our minds and observing our reactions in our daily lives that we will be able to discern the message we are giving and receiving. This is why in the text Jesus cautions us about putting ourselves in charge of our own spiritual process: \"Some of your greatest advances you have judged as failures, and some of your deepest retreats you have evaluated as success\" (T-18.V.1:6). This does not mean, however, that we need to turn to an external teacher because of our deficiencies, although it would not be wrong to do so. The process is primarily an internal one between ourselves and the Holy Spirit, Who holds for us the memory of the truth of Heaven."

    "text_input": "Q #891: I find that I'm only willing to honestly look at my thought system when things are going badly. When I'm comfortable, when all seems \"right with the world,\" I have very little motivation to make the kind of extraordinary commitment to change as is necessary for learning the course. That said, I feel as though on some level I make things in the world bad so that I will be willing to learn. For as long as I believe the world is real (and obviously I am very invested in that belief), I feel that studying A Course in Miracles equals discomfort in every day living. I realize intellectually that Jesus is not punishing me, but I do react that way. How would you recommend that I think about this differently? A: Part of the ego's scheme to convince us that there is life outside of Heaven, and we are enjoying it, is to make a vast array of enticing substitutes for the true happiness that is our inheritance as God's innocent Son. When all seems \"right with the world,\" it can only be due to the fleeting pleasure of having all the ego's specialness needs satisfactorily met. Your experience of wavering motivation in practicing the Course is common. As long as we are satisfied with a life filled with the exhausting effort of finding the \"happiness\" the ego offers, only to have it vanish without notice in an instant, we will not change our minds and awaken from the dream. The ego does a clever job of disguising and denying the pain that permeates its thought system, which is why we need the Holy Spirit's help to uncover the misery that lies beneath the ego's \"good times.\" One of the important goals of the Course is to help us see the inevitable and unavoidable pain of identifying with the ego. As Jesus tells us in the text: \"Anything in this world that you believe is good and valuable and worth striving for can hurt you, and will do so. Not because it has the power to hurt, but just because you have denied it is but an illusion, and made it real\" (T- 26.VI.1:1-2). The goal is not to look for ants at every picnic, but to not be fooled by the meaningless glitter of what does not truly satisfy and does not even exist. The ego would have us believe that when things are rosy we have found a wonderful substitute for Heaven, and when they're not so rosy it's not our fault; God must be punishing us. Thus, the ego gets us coming and going. And just to be sure all the bases are covered with no escape possible, the ego cleverly claims that the only way to learn the Course is to be miserable. This exemplifies its fool-proof",
    "output": "case for dismissing the Course altogether (T-5.VI.10:6), or at least delaying progress by strengthening the belief that the world is real. The Holy Spirit uses all the distinctions between rosy days and gray days to teach us they are all the same, in that they serve as a classroom to practice forgiveness. Jesus straightens our backwards and upside-down interpretation of everything: \"You who are steadfastly devoted to misery must first recognize that you are miserable and not happy. The Holy Spirit cannot teach without this contrast, for you believe that misery is happiness\" (T- 14.II.1:2-3). You are not actually making things bad, but are seeing that the world does not work as a substitute for Heaven, no matter how convincing the ego's story seems. If that serves as motivation to follow a path that leads out of the dream of separation to our true home, a bad day takes on a very useful and positive purpose. And that's not so bad. In fact, it can be seen as evidence that the mind has decided to turn away from the ego toward the Holy Spirit, which gives a happy ending to a bad day. What makes the happiness of this world's misery is the fact that it will end (not to mention that it is not real in the first place), and what does not last cannot bring happiness. Jesus takes this a step further: \"You can be sure indeed that any seeming happiness that does not last is really fear\" (T-22.II.3:5). This means that when we think we are happy about anything in this world we are really afraid, and when we are not happy we are afraid. Obviously we do not know what happiness is. The only way to see this differently is to learn that nothing in this world will make us truly happy. As long as anything in this world is perceived as desirable, misery is inevitable. Keeping this in mind will provide a steady motivation to practice the forgiveness that will lead us out of the nightmare of separation where nothing is truly \"right.\" We need not be totally free of our mistaken ideas about happiness and pain, it is enough that we be willing to admit that we do not know what will make us happy. This is easier said than done since identity with the body depends on being right about who we are. That is why resistance is so great and motivation to learn this Course can be sluggish. Jesus thus tells us what we need to hear more than anything else: \"Step back now, teacher of God. You have been wrong. Lead not the way, for you have lost it\" (M-22.5:7-9; italics added). When all seems \"right with the world,\" it may be helpful just to gently remind yourself of this, without trying to change anything. This introduces doubt, which weakens belief in the ego's version of what is right or wrong, or good or bad, and opens the way to a different interpretation. When the obstacle of the ego's \"rightness\" is removed, the Holy Spirit's is revealed."

    "text_input": "Q #892: I've read much about \"near death experiences\" over the years and have found these accounts almost always inspiring and reassuring. The nature of many of these experiences would seem at odds with the ego's purpose to keep us attached to our bodies. I have read many accounts of NDEs where the experiencer is ecstatic to be free of the body; and most are angry/sad/disappointed at finding themselves back in their bodies after the event. I read an earlier reply to an NDE question where you said that they are sometimes given a 'special' mission to carry out on their return (pandering to the ego); however I have never read one where the returnee felt this experience made him feel 'special.' Mostly they feel extremely grateful to have been given a glimpse of, what they now think, is their true state; and the experience often makes them much better people. I'm wondering how the wonderful feeling of liberation from the body and sense of oneness with everything that many NDEers experience actually serves the ego?",
    "output": "If there is a feeling of oneness with everything--without the slightest need to let others know of it, or the slightest hint of specialness over having had the experience--then it would not be an ego event. From the point of view of A Course in Miracles, however, the person's mind would not be fully healed if the feeling of liberation and all-inclusive love is diminished or changed upon \"finding themselves back in their bodies after the event.\" The Course teaches that love is our reality, not the body; and therefore when your mind is fully identified with that Love of Heaven, you would clearly see the body--as did Jesus--as simply a vehicle through which that Love flows. You would see either that expression of love everywhere or else calls for it; and therefore there would be no sense of sadness or disappointment, as you would know you are not in the body. Your identity remains as it is--apart from the body. The love in your mind would be expressed in bodily form, so that others still identified with their bodies could recognize it and accept it in a way that would not overwhelm them with fear. An NDE, thus, can be a non-ego experience; but that same experience of being beyond the body can occur at any instant we choose against the ego. In other words, it is always accessible to us, as it is solely a matter of the choice we make in our minds, and has nothing to do with the condition of our bodies. A Course in Miracles teaches that the body is a projection of the mind and has no reality in and of itself. In this sense, the mind is the cause and source of all bodily conditions and experiences; the body is only an effect of the mind's decisions. The mind is split between the ego thought system and the correction of that, which is the Holy Spirit's thought system of forgiveness. Thus, all seeming bodily occurrences--physical and psychological--can be understood as symbols reflecting to us our mind's decision for either the ego or the Holy Spirit. This is not our \"true state,\" but true perception, or right-mindedness, leads us there, as Jesus explains: \"It cannot be emphasized too often that correcting perception is merely a temporary expedient ... accurate perception is a steppingstone towards it [knowledge]. The whole value of right perception lies in the inevitable realization that all perception is unnecessary\" (T-4.II.11:1-3). Our true state is as Mind (capital M)--pure spirit, pure oneness, beyond all perception entirely. We experience the reflection of our true state whenever we do not perceive our interests as apart from anyone else's, the consistent practice of which leads to the perception that we are the same."

    "text_input": "Q #893: That we are \"asleep\" and dreaming makes sense to me. I understand that I'm not alone in the creation of this dream and the real me is not what I think it is. I feel I'm making real progress.  Then there's the concept of \"being somewhere\"--which I understand is an idea limited by the necessary use of language of time and space, caused by the belief in separation. And each lifetime is already over, so we are only reviewing. We are in fact not asleep, we are in a state outside of time. And we're being enthralled by guilt? by addiction? by what? causing us to keep compulsively reviewing what has already finished. But why the compulsive rehashing? Is it like wanting to dive back into a dream when you begin to awaken in the morning? If we are the observer, the sleeper, the reviewer--is there actually no self in the dream at all? So it's not so much that \"we are all one\" here, but that our Self is one, and no one is here? I've had a flash that this is true, but then I got scared or excited, and lost the thread.  So is it that here there are just two patterns--like energy patterns structuring thought, creating projections: the Holy Spirit's and the ego's? And that infusing those two movies with identity is the observer, sleeper, dreamer? And that by identifying with the thought system closest in vibration to the real one, we begin to resonate with the observer and remember that we actually aren't in the dream?",
    "output": "You are right--there is no self in the dream, only projected images with which we each have chosen to identify. And the fragmented self or mind that has chosen to identify with only a certain image in the dream is simply an aspect of one self that we all share. However, that self we all share is not our true Self, but the illusory self of the split mind--the observer you've referred to above. It is this self, outside the dream of time and space, that A Course in Miracles is asking us to recognize increasingly as our identity, through the practice of forgiveness. This self has the choice either to continue to identify with the false ego thought system of sin and guilt, or the Holy Spirit's true thought system of forgiveness and peace--the two energy patterns you refer to. The Holy Spirit's thought system is still an illusion, because it is a correction for the ego's lies and deception, but it is a reflection of the oneness of our true Self, which has been completely unaffected by the imaginings of the split mind. The reason for the \"compulsive rehashing\" from the perspective of the ego thought system is that identifying with the dream figure and relishing our various roles in the dream are what keep us unaware that we are the mind reviewing and not the figure acting in the dream. This confusion guarantees that the separation will not be healed, for we keep our focus on the projected dream, where no real change can be effected, rather than on the projecting part of the mind, where a different choice can be made. In other words, we want to remain identified with the ego and we want to maintain the separation (T-4.VI.4:2-4; T-13.III.2:5), and reviewing what is already over and past merely keeps the thought system underlying those dreams alive in our mind, with no apparent opportunity to make a different choice. We reinforce our identification with the observer role in the mind through the practice of forgiveness, which is simply the releasing of our judgments. Judgment keeps us rooted in the rehashing, believing that something of import and significance is happening here, with some outcomes to be preferred over others. So long as we value our judgments, we will value the dream, and we will not be open to the process of awakening. And while we fear awakening, our insights into the unreality of this world can be both exciting and frightening."

He and my husband never got along too well, causing me many hardships. Furthermore he had a rather difficult time here in Sweden, where we live, because of his ethnicity, and developed a negative attitude toward what he calls Europe-centricity. Is all this my own projection? My concern is that the community he joined now might have a more or less fanatical side to it. On the other hand I am fully aware that he must choose his own spiritual way. And even A Course in Miracles tells us that there are many ways. So who am I to judge? I was mothering him long enough, but still have difficulties in completely letting him go. How can I meet him without being afraid, without trying to convince him that the way of the Course might be better for him. How can I ask the Holy Spirit for help?",
    "output": "It is a very difficult lesson for a mother to watch her child making choices that she does not agree with, especially if she believes the choices could place her child in danger. The Course does not offer any specific answer about what if anything to say to your son, or whether to intervene in any way. It does ask--as it asks every student of the Course--that you be honest about your reactions and judgments in response to your son's choices and actions, for these are your projections. And once you have acknowledged and released your own projections, then whatever you say or do, or not, will be loving and helpful. What is critical to recognize is the interpretation you may be making based on whatever form in the world you are observing. Certainly, it can simply be an honest evaluation of the facts that leads you to conclude that there may be a potential for violence in the situation your son has become involved in. But if you experience anxiety or fear or any other form of upset as you consider that possibility, you must be making an ego interpretation (e.g., T-4.IV.4). For you are viewing the situation in terms of actual or potential victims and victimizers, and once that distinction has become real in your mind, you can be sure that projection is involved. Granted, the perception of victims and victimizers is very difficult to avoid while we remain identified with our separated selves, but that is only because the projection of our inner guilt, which is not real, is what in fact maintains the belief that there is danger outside of us (e.g., W-pI.121.2-4). But such a perception is neither accurate nor justified. That we have been caught in the ego's interpretation of a situation is evident if we become involved in evaluating the relative merits of each position in the conflict, as the ego would have us do (e.g., T-12.I.2). For the only real problem is the very fact that we are perceiving the situation in terms of victims and victimizers, thus denying the power of every mind to choose what its experience shall be (T-28.II.5). The world and people can be unkind and cruel, and apparent victims can feel justified in striking back. But unless we can step back and look from above the battleground, any perception we have will only reinforce our belief in victims and victimizers, no matter how hard we try to be fair and reasonable. So you can ask the Holy Spirit or Jesus for help in looking with you at your fears and concerns and judgments. And they will remind you that nothing is at it seems, and the only reason you are in fear and conflict is because you continue to want to believe in the reality of the separation (T- 2.VI.4:1-4). For that is what keeps the self you want to believe you are, including all its various roles, such as mother, alive in your perception and your experience. Peace will never be found in any of the specific roles, but only when we can begin to take all of our roles less seriously, and recognize that we are all simply brothers and sisters to each other, with the same Father."

The first half of my life I was intensely searching for a faith, probably largely because I felt so insecure, and I was not interested in worldly things. Now it seems that I need to get more earthed and I wonder whether letting go of my ego is a sensible thing for me to do, given my difficulties. On the other hand, I feel very drawn to A Course in Miracles and it makes a lot of sense to me in general. My development was arrested when I was very young and in reading someone's e-mail regarding children and that didactic teaching of the Course is not appropriate for them, I was wondering whether this might also apply to me.",
    "output": "Since letting go of the ego is the very end of the process that the Course is leading us along, and along the way, especially at the beginning, the focus is simply on recognizing our ego and not condemning ourselves for having one, the Course could in fact be a helpful part of your healing. For your description of your earlier flight from the ego suggests that, while overtly attempting to rise above worldly things, you were actually making them very real in your perception and were therefore reinforcing your ego, their source. But now, with the Course, you can begin to learn how to look at your ego and all its various expressions without fear or self- condemnation. It is important to remember that the Course's process is not ever one of giving up anything, including the ego, but rather one of learning to use whatever we have already made real in our lives for a different purpose--for forgiveness rather than for separation and attack and guilt and fear. For no matter what the various forms may have been, the ego has been in charge of all of our lives, until we learn there is a different choice for how we will use all our life experiences. And while we are identified with the ego, we all suffer from the same disease. As Jesus clarifies for us: \"Sickness is insanity because all sickness is mental illness, and in it there are no degrees. One of the illusions by which sickness is perceived as real is the belief that illness varies in intensity; that the degree of threat differs according to the form it takes. Herein lies the basis of all errors, for all of them are but attempts to compromise by seeing just a little bit of hell\" (P-2.IV.8:1-3; italics added). Certainly, given your experience up until now, you will want to be careful that you do not simply focus on those parts of the Course that describe the end of the forgiveness process, trying to jump over the steps that it is attempting to lead you along that involve looking directly at the ugliness of the ego without taking it seriously. For this looking is a central part of the process of learning to accept yourself and others just where each of you happens to be on your Atonement path (T- 9.III.6:4). And that is really what forgiveness is all about. Although parallels have been suggested to you between your arrested development and a child's, you have the benefit as an adult of being able to reflect on where you have been and where you are going. Certainly, much like a child, you may have to expend more effort learning how to cope with the world and its demands, but you have a capacity for self-observation that will enable you to recognize when you have chosen your ego as a way of avoiding dealing with the world, and what the costs are, so that you will be able to make a different choice, if you want to."

    "text_input": "Q #896: While studying A Course in Miracles, I am really struggling with \"not struggling\" during the workbook practice periods. In other words, I can't seem to quiet my mind. Any suggestions?",
    "output": "Your struggle is addressed in Lesson 9 of the workbook: \"It is difficult for the untrained mind to believe that what it seems to picture is not there. This idea can be quite disturbing, and may meet with active resistance in any number of forms\" (W-pI.9.2:1-2). Jesus tells us here that, to the ego, the message of the workbook (the Course itself) is disturbing. The busy chatter of a noisy mind is one of the forms that resistance to its message takes. It is the ego's way of insisting that the thoughts and experiences of the body are real, and have the power to obliterate from awareness the memory of God. The strategy works, because to whatever extent the noise is taken seriously, it is given the power to keep the memory of God's Love out. Struggling not to struggle is struggling, which is another form of resistance that gives power to the noise. Because trying not to resist will not work, Jesus gives us another helpful instruction in the \"Rules for Decision\": \"...if you find resistance strong and dedication weak, you are not ready. Do not fight yourself\" (T-30.I.1:6-7). The first thing to do in practicing the workbook, therefore, is to stay calm. Since Jesus tells us we will resist, we should not be surprised by the noise that seems to intrude on the quiet. The noise is saying: \"I am afraid to be quiet.\" As you have observed, struggling against this only compounds the fear and the noise, in a seemingly hopeless battle, wherein the busy mind is judged as sinful and thus made real, to serve as an obstacle to the quiet. Thus, the ego is safe as long as you struggle. Moreover, thinking that the struggle can be won further strengthens the ego's belief that it is in charge of the Atonement, which guarantees the continuance of noisy thoughts. Recognizing this is the beginning of quieting the mind, because the source and purpose of the noisy chatter have been rightfully acknowledged. It is possible to train the mind to observe the invasion of thoughts without judging them, reminding yourself gently: \"I am too afraid to be quiet.\" This gentle, non-judgmental reminder takes the edge off the struggle. It is preferable to look honestly at how fearful and resistant we are without judgment for a brief instant, than to spend long periods struggling to be quiet. In this practice, less is definitely more. In fact, in several places in the workbook we find reminders to stop whenever there is any sense of strain (see, for example, W-pI.12.6:4). The split mind has over learned forgetting, and it takes patient unlearning to remember. The patience that is one of the characteristics of God's teachers (M-4.VIII) rests on certainty of the outcome. So when your mind is full of thoughts, it may be helpful to remember that the quiet and the memory of God remain undisturbed by all the \"toys and trinkets of the world\" (W- pII.258.1:3). The memory of God will return to awareness because it never left the mind. When Jesus tells us to remember that this is our goal, he does not establish a required time span, it is enough to remember for an instant at a time: \"All that is needful is to train our minds to overlook all little senseless aims, and to remember that our goal is God. His memory is hidden in our minds, obscured but by our pointless little goals which offer nothing, and do not exist\" (W- pII.258.1:1-2). (For more on this topic see Questions #35, #90, and #351.)"

As an example, most people now are aware that governments all over the world are not honest with each other nor with their own citizens. If we accept that the world as we experience it is merely a dream generated by guilt and attack, it presumably follows that any particular act of deception--even a real whopper--can be nothing more than illusion within illusion. And since the Course tells us that there is no hierarchy of illusions, the conclusion presumably must be that it makes no difference whether governments are honest or not, since the very world in which they govern is itself an ego fabrication. As a student of the Course with a lingering attachment to the notion of objective truth within the world, I would welcome any guidance on how to respond to this kind of issue.",
    "output": "Recognizing the two levels on which the Course is written can be helpful. Your description expresses what we refer to as Level One teachings--the absolute contrast between truth and illusion. On that level, anything and everything that takes place in the world is illusory. That should be the end of the story for us. But because we are too frightened to accept that without any reservations, and therefore still think the world is real and react to it accordingly (including our own bodily existence), Jesus continues the story. This is Level Two: Jesus talking to us in terms of what we still think is real, even though we know intellectually that \"there is no life outside of Heaven\" (T-23.II.19:1). Mercifully, and gently, Jesus teaches us how to go about our lives in the world so as to undo our belief that we exist independently apart from God--rather than to reinforce that strenuously defended belief. This is the \"thought-reversal\" dimension of the workbook lessons and exercises. Being able to count on people's truthfulness is a normal expectation, and would certainly ease the strain of daily life in this incredibly complex and challenging world. Unfortunately, that expectation meets with disappointment far more often than most of us appreciate. Yet, this should not be surprising, given the origin of the world and its inhabitants: that it is the projection of a thought of attack, generated by a mind fierce in its determination to get what it wants regardless of the cost, ready to kill to keep what it has thus gotten but not take any responsibility for the resulting mayhem. Everything that goes on in this world comes from that thought, which is why Jesus tells us that the world is \"the outside picture of an inward condition\" (T-21.in.1:5). Everything here is ultimately based on a lie--that the oneness of pure Love can be splintered into self-centered, competing individuals. The value therefore of a strong negative reaction to deception perceived in others is that it reveals the deception in ourselves, thus giving us the opportunity to forgive it. The Course thus teaches us to regard the world as a classroom, with the curriculum being our daily experiences and relationships. Our objective is ask for help to shift our focus from the world and the body to our minds--specifically, the purpose infusing our thoughts and actions, stemming from our choice of teachers. This is the \"inward condition\" in need of attention. On this level, then, our function is to turn within to get some sense of whether we are proceeding from the ego thought system or the Holy Spirit's thought system. We practice asking for help more and more frequently to set aside our egos, so that our interactions in the world would be truly helpful in advancing us to the only goal worth pursuing: returning home hand in hand with everyone. We are never asked to resign from our normal roles in the world as citizens, parents, employers, employees, etc. We are asked, though, to resign as our own teacher (T-12.V.8:3), meaning we (as identified with the ego thought system) should turn to Jesus or the Holy Spirit for help in defining our problems and their solutions. The application of this to a situation such as the one you describe is that you would bring to the place of ego-free love in your right mind all of your judgments and feelings of anger, despair, and victimization. In that holy instant of looking at your wrong mind with your right mind, you would automatically get a sense of whether to do or say something or nothing. There would be no investment in having things change, even if you voiced your opinion or supported a group working toward change. The main point that Jesus is trying to help us learn is that nothing of value has been accomplished when the desired external change has been effected, while internally one feels triumphant over having defeated the \"enemy\"--no matter how beneficial the change is to the world. \"Forget not that the healing of God's Son is all the world is for. That is the only purpose the Holy Spirit sees in it, and thus the only one it has. Until you see the healing of the Son as all you wish to be accomplished by the world, by time and all appearances, you will not know the Father nor yourself\" (T-24.VI.4:1-3). This is the right-minded approach to every situation that confronts us in the world. We need to grow toward this-- that this would become our sole motivation in everything we think and do. See Questions #53, #455, #484, and #599 for a discussion of issues and principles that have a bearing on your query."

    "text_input": "Q #898: I feel that I am beginning to grasp the principles of A Course in Miracles fairly well, although I do wonder if it is the ego mind fooling me! My question is this: are the people with whom I interact and I all in the same dream? I have read the question about \"you in my dream and I in yours,\" but that doesn't answer it. If we are not in the same dream, how then can I impact their spiritual situation/awareness? Ah, but it's about impacting my own, isn't it? The forgiveness I learn to practice is not for \"them,\" it's for me, which is all the same. So have I answered part of the question myself? I am still puzzled about who is in which dream, though. A: You've got it! This course is about one person--you and the healing of your mind! As Jesus states, \"you can interact but with yourself\" (T-31.V.15:5). If we persist in thinking we can have an impact on others--and wanting to--we are missing Jesus' overall message, which is that the Son of God is one. We cannot relate to that on an abstract level, but we can reflect that truth by perceiving our interests as the same as everyone else's. We learn this by practicing it in our daily interactions with each other--especially when tempted to focus on changing someone else. That should always be a red flag telling us that we have succumbed again to the ego's never-ending effort to convince us that separation is the truth. This approach does not lead to indifference or passivity with regard to others, however. The point is that when you choose against your ego, you are the love that is the only reality in your mind, and it will then flow through you in a form that can be understood and accepted by anyone calling for it. Love is in the director's seat now, not you as an individual. It makes things much easier! When you spend a lot of time trying to figure out \"who is in which dream,\" you are in danger of falling into the ego's trap of making the error real. You would be trying to come up with a schemata explainable in human, logical categories for a process that is non-human and inherently illusory. Jesus is using metaphors and symbols for our benefit, as a means of getting us started with the process of restoring sanity and truth to our minds. Struggling to understand the nature of dreams and scripts can be a neat ego trick to distract you from what would really help you in your quest for peace: the practice of forgiveness.",

    "text_input": "Q #899: My question seems to have been addressed somewhat in #417, but having read your answer, I'm still unclear on how to separate form from content. I am unmarried but have had a monogamous 14 year \"special\" relationship. We do not live together. Almost a year ago, I met someone else and began an affair. Shortly thereafter I confided the affair to my boyfriend who has chosen to remain with me. I feel very strongly that for some reason, I'm supposed to know this other person. And for some reason I'm supposed to be going through all of this as part of the process to extricate the \"specialness\" out of my primary relationship. I'm confused about  whether this is part of the forgiveness process or ego insanity or both, depending upon what day of the week it is. It seems insane to everyone around me who are all unfamiliar with A Course in Miracles. And as mentioned in your response to #417, you advise it's helpful to remove interferences such as guilt if only for an instant. How do I do that? My guilt over hurting my \"special\" partner is enormous and growing. I cannot imagine ending my relationship with the other person and all this feels as though it is destroying my primary \"special\" relationship.",
    "output": "It is not clear what you mean by \"extricating specialness\" from the relationship. You describe the form of the relationships, but not the content. Specialness, as taught in A Course in Miracles, is always about content, and never about form (behavior), nor are relationships. The Course talks only about asking Jesus or the Holy Spirit to help you change the purpose of the relationship from specialness to holiness. Many students have wrongly interpreted this to mean that they should not have an exclusive relationship on the level of form, because a holy relationship excludes no one. Yes, that is true, but it applies solely to the content of the holy (non-special) relationship; but this content of all-inclusiveness is perfectly consistent with a monogamous relationship. The transformation of content involves evaluating the purpose of the relationship. In a special relationship, the purpose is always related to what you can get from the relationship and how it serves your interests; therefore, it always involves dependency, expectations, bargaining, compromise, sacrifice, manipulation, and deception. Separation and separate interests become reinforced over and over. All relationships start out that way. By inviting Jesus into the relationship, you would gradually shift its purpose from maintaining separation to learning that you and your partner share the same interests, and that this extends to everyone else as well. Your focus would be on learning to recognize that you both share the same wrong mind, the same right mind, and the same decision-making capacity to choose either the ego's or the Holy Spirit's thought system. The relationship's primary focus, thus, is not on filling each other's needs in order to make your lives better in the world, but on having your mind be healed of all thoughts of separation--learning that your completion is achieved only through recognizing that your need for completion stems from having rejected your wholeness as the Self of Christ, and that this is a decision that can be changed at any instant (see T-16.V). It remains unclear why you would need to have an affair to learn this, especially one that has engendered such conflict. In general, we can say that when guidance comes from the Holy Spirit, there would be a growing sense of peace about it, not increasing guilt and conflict. Guilt and conflict should be a red flag indicating that something is not quite right, and perhaps the prevailing opinion of those who know you well is in accord with that. The ego is very skillful in using spiritual teachings to further its own plan of keeping separation real. Another sure sign that a relationship is centered in specialness is the feeling \"I cannot imagine ending my relationship with the other person.\" Now, that might also be right-minded in the sense that this is the person with whom you have chosen to learn your forgiveness lessons. But, again, there would be a growing sense of peace about it, as forgiveness always leads to an increasing awareness that both you and your partner are centered in the one same Christ Self, not in each other as separate individuals. The dependency on bodily togetherness lessens, as you gradually realize you are the same as minds. The spiritual journey in A Course in Miracles is toward oneness."

    "text_input": "Q #900: What about solipsism, the theory that nothing exists or is real but the self? For me the greatest fear is that of cosmic aloneness. I sometimes wake up feeling, \"It's true! There is no one else.\" The philosophers witter on about \"private language,\" but their arguments don't stand up to the experience, horror, and the conviction. A Course in Miracles talks a lot about unification and how the split will return to being whole. Doesn't that sound kind of lonely? Why \"we\"? Why not \"I\"? If I'm dreaming the perceived world, why aren't I dreaming other people? When unification happens, the \"Returning\" as they say in Zen, why should this be good? Why not awful? Is it because bliss is a non-dual emotion, as against any kind of fear which is dualistic? That may be true, except the fear we call \"horror\" has a frozen feel to it, a sort of resignation. A: Cosmic aloneness is probably one good definition of hell. But \"aloneness\" implies a self that experiences itself as a self, as does fear. And that is not what A Course in Miracles means by unity or oneness, which is a state transcending consciousness all together. Jesus tells us that in our present state there is no way we can understand \"a Oneness joined as One\" (T-25.I.7:2). But he assures us often in the Course that when our minds are healed of all separation thoughts, we will be indescribably happy and peaceful, as in one instance he exclaims: \"O my brothers, if you only knew the peace that will envelop you and hold you safe and pure and lovely in the Mind of God, you could but rush to meet Him where His altar is. Hallowed your Name and His, for they are joined here in this holy place. Here He leans down to lift you up to Him, out of illusions into holiness; out of the world and to eternity; out of all fear and given back to love\" (C-4.8:1-3).",
    "output": "No solipsist has ever spoken like that! Egoless love and solipsism are mutually exclusive: \"For it is the function of love to unite all things unto itself, and to hold all things together by extending its wholeness\" (T-12.VIII.7:11). We need to learn--through the process of forgiveness--that we are the dreamers of our own dreams so that we can recover our mind's power to choose. When we come back to that, we will clearly see what we chose against--a love embracing all creation as one--in order to have our individual existence. We will also realize the pain involved in maintaining that existence through denial and projection, and that will cause us to be less and less attracted to it, especially because we will have remembered it was a choice based on fictitious premises (the Course's myth of the ego). At the beginning of Lesson 107, Jesus uses our language and familiar experience to give us a hint of what awaits us when our minds are healed: \"Can you imagine what a state of mind without illusions is? How it would feel? Try to remember when there was a time,--perhaps a minute, maybe even less--when nothing came to interrupt your peace; when you were certain you were loved and safe. Then try to picture what it would be like to have that moment be extended to the end of time and to eternity. Then let the sense of quiet that you felt be multiplied a hundred times, and then be multiplied another hundred more. And now you have a hint, not more than just the faintest intimation of the state your mind will rest in when the truth has come. Without illusions there could be no fear, no doubt and no attack ... all pain is over ... \" (W-pI.107.2; 3:1-3). The practice of forgiveness leads to the recognition of how painful it is to exist in a state of separation, a pain we have been denying. As that becomes clearer to us, our hold on separation decreases, realizing that it is a most unnatural state, and then we are attracted more and more to our natural state as the extension of God's Love. We sacrifice nothing, feeling only gratitude for being home at last."

When I try to change my mind--that is, choose the Holy Spirit and not the ego--inevitably I refer to my brain, but the Course teaches that the brain doesn't think. I am a very visual person and seem to need to \"see\" something. I picture my mind outside and above me. So my question is, where is the mind? And how should we think of it when we are trying to make a better choice? If the mind uses the brain to project its message, can we just visualize the brain as a receiver from the mind?",
    "output": "Yes, that is one place to start, as long as you regard the mind as the source of the brain and the body--something concocted by the mind as a way of convincing itself that it is not a mind. The fact that you--and most people --need to \"see\" something indicates the extent to which this dynamic has worked. The mind has no physical/quantifiable dimensions to it, so it is not anywhere. That seems inconceivable to us, and for the most part it is--we cannot conceptualize it. The mind is not in a place. A mystic once described God as He whose center is everywhere, and whose circumference is nowhere. Meaningless to a brain! Similarly, Jesus asks, \"Who is the 'you' who are living in this world?\" (T-4.II.11:8)--encouraging us to question the reality of the self we think we are. So when you are trying to make a better choice, you might visualize going from the brain back to the mind, which has a decision-making center; and from that center it can choose to make the ego part of that mind its reality or the Holy Spirit part its reality. That choice then is expressed in form through the body. Then as the mind identifies more and more with the Holy Spirit's thought system, it gradually realizes it is only a mind and that the body/brain really has nothing to do with that identity."

    "output": "There are many places in the Course where Jesus points out how his life and teachings have been misinterpreted. Here is a sampling; we recommend that you read each of these in their full context in the Course. For a discussion of the nature of the biblical Jesus versus the Jesus of A Course in Miracles, see our The Message of A Course in Miracles, Vol. One: All Are Called, Chapter 6; and for additional references see our Glossary-Index for A Course in Miracles, under Jesus. \"Is he the Christ? O yes, along with you ... Some bitter idols have been made of him who would be only brother to the world. Forgive him your illusions, and behold how dear a brother he would be to you\" (C-5.5:1-2,7-8). \" ... I was persecuted as the world judges, and did not share this evaluation for myself. And because I did not share it, I did not strengthen it. I therefore offered a different interpretation of attack, and one which I want to share with you. If you will believe it, you will help me teach it\" (T-6.I.5:3-6). \"I am the model for rebirth, but rebirth itself is merely the dawning on your mind of what is already in it. God placed it there Himself, and so it is true forever. I believed in it, and therefore accepted it as true for me ... My brothers slept during the so-called 'agony in the garden,' but I could not be angry with them because I knew I could not be abandoned\" (T-6.I.7:2-6). \"I elected, for your sake and mine, to demonstrate that the most outrageous assault, as judged by the ego, does not matter. As the world judges these things, but not as God knows them, I was betrayed, abandoned, beaten, torn, and finally killed. It was clear that this was only because of the projection of others onto me, since I had not harmed anyone and had healed many\" (T-6.I.9). \"If the Apostles had not felt guilty, they never could have quoted me as saying, 'I come not to bring peace but a sword.' This is clearly the opposite of everything I taught. Nor could they have described my reactions to Judas as they did, if they had really understood me. I could not have said, 'Betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?' unless I believed in betrayal. The whole message of the crucifixion was simply that I did not\" (T-6.I.15:2-6). \"As you read the teachings of the Apostles, remember that I told them myself that there was much they would understand later, because they were not wholly ready to follow me at the time. I do not want you to allow any fear to enter into the thought system toward which I am guiding you. I do not call for martyrs but for teachers. No one is punished for sins, and the Sons of God are not sinners\" (T-6.I.16:1-4). \"I am made welcome in the state of grace, which means you have at last forgiven me. For I became the symbol of your sin, and so I had to die instead of you. To the ego sin means death, and so atonement is achieved through murder. Salvation is looked upon as a way by which the Son of God was killed instead of you. Yet would I offer you my body, you whom I love, knowing its littleness? Or would I teach that bodies cannot keep us apart? Mine was of no greater value than yours; no better means for communication of salvation, but not its Source. No one can die for anyone, and death does not atone for sin\" (T-19.IV-A.17:1-8)."

    "text_input": "Q #903: I am having trouble with joining with the Holy Spirit before looking at my guilt. How do I know I've joined first before looking? I recall hearing that we should try to catch the thought of guilt and separation before it is projected out into the world. The problem is that I think it's already out there. I then recall reading that when I am dealing with specifics that I am with the ego, so I try not to enumerate my specific problems as I see them, instead trying to \"see the problem as it is, so it can be solved.\" When I do sit quietly and try to be honest, my mind goes nuts.

Also, just how many \"dark nights of the soul\" are there anyway? A: There is no way of knowing for sure that you have joined with the Holy Spirit before looking--this is every student's complaint. Clarity comes only after a great deal of practice, and having caught yourself again and again fooling yourself into thinking you have joined with the",
    "output": "Holy Spirit, only to find yourself craftily indulging your ego. We all have to learn just how committed we are to upholding our specialness and victimization and how terribly frightened we are to be without it. That kind of honesty is a condition for making progress with this course, but we resist it strenuously because we still fear we will be punished if we face up to our \"sins.\" Jesus assures us, though, that all that is needed is our \"little willingness.\" He tells us to trust and concentrate only on that willingness, and to \"be not disturbed that shadows surround it. That is why you came. If you could come without them you would not need the holy instant. Come to it not in arrogance, assuming that you must achieve the state its coming brings with it\" (T- 18.IV.2:3-7). In general, if you are looking at your guilt with the Holy Spirit, you would find yourself easing up on your judgments and self-hatred. You would learn how to smile gently at it instead of beating yourself up all the time and feeling you have failed somehow because you chose your ego. This kind of practice will lead you to the next step of catching the thought before it gets projected. But we are attracted to guilt, as Jesus tells us (T-19.IV-A), which means we will find it hard to simply smile at our guilt and not take it so seriously. Guilt is the cornerstone of the ego thought system, and therefore it will fight hard to hold on to it. It can be helpful to recognize how we support this effort in our daily lives. It may not seem like it, but you are making progress just recognizing your projections of guilt and separation. That is the first step in the forgiveness process. Most people can learn to do that without much difficulty. And if you can do that consistently--without judging yourself for projecting--then you will be preparing yourself to take the next step--looking without judgment at the guilt in your own mind. This is the process that will lead you finally to be able to catch the thought before the decision is made to project it. The key, though, is learning how to be patient and gentle with yourself. Forcing yourself in any way is not in keeping with the gentleness of Jesus' approach throughout the Course. Taking it so seriously is to forget that this process is about undoing something that never happened. Therefore, when a part of your practice drives you \"nuts,\" you probably have lost touch with the gentle content of what you are supposed to be doing. Jesus never expects us to become slaves to the form he suggests for our practicing--the purpose of all our practicing is to be able to experience his love with less and less interference. In Lesson 70, he reminds us that we will have to go through the clouds that surround the light before we can reach the light. He encourages us as our loving brother: \"Try to pass the clouds by whatever means appeals to you. If it helps you, think of me holding your hand and leading you. And I assure you this will be no idle fantasy\" (W-pI.70.9:2-4). If you feel pressure as you walk this path, it can only be from your ego, and therefore should not be taken seriously. In the sense that these clouds of guilt constitute our journey, one can say that we repeat the \"dark night of the soul\" in many variations--until we emerge into the light."

    "text_input": "Q #904: As I understand it, A Course in Miracles teaches that our ego created the world and it is all just an illusion. I have always seen nature and the work of creation as the biggest proof of God's existence! When I look at all the beauty in nature, the intricacy, the multitude, and the magnitude--from the vastness of space to the unbelievable complexity of DNA--it seems only God could have created something like this! How can I believe that the human mind is capable of conceiving such greatness?",
    "output": "There are really two parts to your question; how could the mind have made the world, and how could God not have created it? The Bible and our western religions define God as the creator of the world. But A Course in Miracles tells us that the Bible's God is a product of the ego. It seeks to help us remember that the true God is a God of eternal, perfect, changeless love. The Course teaches that this real God could not possibly have created anything that doesn't share his quality of being eternal and changeless (C-4.1). Since everything in this physical universe (even that which seems eternal to us, such as the stars) will eventually perish, nothing on the level of form could possibly come from God. From the Course perspective, qualities such as intricacy, multitude, magnitude, vastness, and even physical beauty, have nothing to do with God. Anything with these qualities then, must have come from another source. As you stated, the Course tells us that we made the world up (T- 20.VIII.7:3-5). But the Course isn't teaching that the world was conceived by the human mind. The Course's view of the human or individual mind (which we generally think of as being controlled by the brain) is that it, like the physical world, is entirely illusory (C-1.4:1)--it's just another part of the dream. Within the dream, we are all split minds, containing the thought systems of both the ego and the Holy Spirit. Therefore we can experience the world as a symbol of either thought system. Thus the beauty of nature can serve to help us remember the Holy Spirit's beautiful Love in our mind. The mind that made up the world however, is outside of time and space. It's the one mind of the Son of God, which appeared to fall asleep and dream that it was separate from its source. Obviously, this is a mind that none of us who think we're bodies can begin to comprehend. From within this dream of physical, individual human existence, none of this makes any sense. But think of the dreams you have at night. While you're having them, they seem absolutely real. Only after awakening can you look back and know that they were made up. Understanding this phenomenon, the Course doesn't require us to begin by accepting or understanding that the world is our dream. Indeed, if we could do that, we would be awake and wouldn't need the Course. Instead we are merely asked to consider that maybe we are wrong about the world and how we got here. To help us develop the willingness to do that, the Course exposes our motivation for choosing this dream of separation and the pain inherent in doing so."

    "text_input": "Q #905: For years my husband has expressed uneasiness about my assertive personality. As a student of A Course in Miracles, I've asked the Holy Spirit to help me look at my feelings about this issue. This process has made me more accepting of myself and less concerned about other people's opinions. But recently I had to make some difficult business decisions. My decisions seemed to make my business partners uneasy (my husband is one of my business partners). Now I sense that they're all judging me for being overly assertive. I'm having tremendous guilt about this and am not sure how to deal with it. A: Since all of us who think we are here have chosen to drown out God's Voice and listen to our own instead, you might say that we all have overly assertive personalities. The Course teaches us that the one cause of all our guilt is the decision to see ourselves as separate from God's Love. Further the Course states, \"As long as you believe that guilt is justified in any way ... you will not look within, where you would always find Atonement. The end of guilt will never come as long as you believe there is a reason for it\" (T-13.X.6:1-2).",
    "output": "In other words, our ego continually makes up reasons for our guilt in order to make sure we never recognize that the guilt itself is made up and that our minds have the power to let it go. So whenever we think that our guilt comes from something we have said or done, we have (once again) been tricked by the ego's smokescreen. Remember too that the ego doesn't care whether we see others or ourselves as guilty. The ego is happy as long as we believe that guilt is real and remain focused on the effect our ego has on other egos. As a Course student, you probably realize that the judgments of your husband or your business partners would not be causing you guilt if you had not first accused yourself of something. The fact that your recent business decisions triggered your guilt is undoubtedly because, at some point in the process, you saw your interests as separate from others. Thus your decisions (whether you feel you made \"the right\" decisions or not) have become symbols in your mind for the original decision to see your interests as separate from God's. Therefore in your thinking, your decisions now equal attack. The Course doesn't give us any guidelines for behavior--you may or may not, for example, be assertive as the world judges it. But the Course does make clear that we are always listening to either the voice of the ego or the Holy Spirit. So the way to \"deal with\" guilt is to ask the Holy Spirit for help before we make decisions or take actions (and of course, recognize that our ego- driven actions of the past were merely mistakes calling for correction not punishment). As we learn more and more to join with Jesus or the Holy Spirit in our mind, the choices we make will increasingly reflect God's all-inclusive Love. When our actions become reflections of love rather than symbols of attack, our guilt will automatically disappear."

But I am having a challenge with releasing a perceived problem that I created. How do I let it go if I feel responsible for it? I am truly tired of playing this game.",
    "output": "It is very common for Course students who have understood intellectually that guilt is not real and recognized how guilty they feel, to develop guilt about feeling guilty. This is just another clever ploy of the ego to insure it remains intact and in control. As A Course in Miracles says: \"The ego seeks to 'resolve' its problems, not at their source, but where they were not made. And thus it seeks to guarantee there will be no solution.\" (T-17.III.6:1-2) You don't want to deny your guilt, let it go, or make it go away. You simply want to observe it. Watching the ego's vicious judgment without judgment is the way to learn that you are not the ego and thus not guilty. Remember, no matter how long you study the Course or how often you ask the Holy Spirit for help, your ego does not change. It is the voice of guilt and will always seek to convince you that your guilt is real and justified. What does change is your ability to take the ego's voice less seriously and to listen to the Holy Spirit instead (which is, after all, the one thing the Son of God needed to do in the original instant when the tiny mad idea occurred). So again, don't despair about having feelings of guilt; just watch them. Eventually when the ego screams at you (yet again) that you've made an awful mess and should feel good and guilty about it, you'll be able to just gently smile at your ego as you think, \"There it goes again.\" When you truly look with the Holy Spirit's Love at whatever problem you feel responsible for, you'll think something like, \"Well of course I did that silly thing, that's what egos do.\" In that place of love, you'll understand the fear that must have caused your ego to act up and you'll automatically know what words to say or actions to take (if any) to bring a loving resolution to the perceived problem."

Now he says he would like to make contact again. I love him as my brother in this world and I honor the lessons he showed me; I learned some very valuable things; but is it still loving and forgiving to not want any physical, verbal, or electronic contact with him, since I know he still has his drug addiction problem and I know it is his way of calling for love? In my mind I honor him for who he is and still practice seeing him and myself as a holy innocent child of God every time my ego seeks some kind of justification or revenge. What is the best and highest and most loving way to say that I do not want any contact? I just want to do what is best for the both of us; and is it true that sometimes the most loving thing to do is to just end it all and walk away and say no? A: There is nothing in A Course in Miracles, as you know, that would tell you what you should do behaviorally-- to stay or to leave. Its focus is always on the content: whether your thinking reflects the ego's principles or the Holy Spirit's principles. One principle that is frequently misapplied--with sometimes tragic results--is the idea that a person is either expressing love or calling for love. While it is true that destructive behavior is a ultimately a call for love, nothing automatically follows from that in terms of behavior. For instance, just because a pedophile is \"calling for love,\" does not mean that you allow him to take care of your children if he asks you to. But you can say \"no\" without separating yourself from him on the level of content--you can realize that you both are calling for love and are joined in that respect. Don't confuse form with content. From that place of non-judgment you will know what to say. This is essentially how Jesus replied to Helen's questioning him about what she should say to people; he said to her, \"ask instead, 'Help me to see this brother through the eyes of truth and not of judgment'\" (Absence from Felicity, p. 381). Staying in the relationship thus can be a right-minded decision, just as leaving the relationship can be a right-minded decision. Your seeing this man as a \"holy innocent child of God\" is independent of the form of the relationship; and, again, from within your quiet center, the Holy Spirit will gently guide you to the most loving response in form.",

We then think we are at the mercy of people and forces beyond our control, forgetting completely--and intentionally--that it was our own decision that led us to that self-concept. There is a helpful discussion of this mistake in the section in the text of A Course in Miracles called \"The Responsibility for Sight\" (T-21.II). There Jesus helps us realize that we are responsible for how we interpret external events and situations, meaning we do not have to see ourselves as victimized. We do not cause others to behave badly, nor do we cause catastrophes; but we are responsible for the way we react to these externals. This is why the early lessons in the workbook focus so heavily on training us to recognize that the outer and the inner are the same. Our reactions always come from a prior decision we have made in our minds to uphold the thought system of guilt or the thought system of guiltlessness. Jesus is asking us to let him help us to look at our guilt and then to let it go. What other people think and do, then, would have no effect on our state of mind. In Lesson 70, \"My salvation comes from me,\" Jesus summarizes this by saying, \"The seeming cost of accepting today's idea is this: It means that nothing outside yourself can save you; nothing outside yourself can give you peace. But it also means that nothing outside yourself can hurt you, or disturb your peace or upset you in any way\" (W- pI.70.2:1-2)."

There are any number of ways in which our minds can be healed of the belief that we are separate from God and therefore sinners deserving of punishment. So the question is whether the message coming through is loving and helpful in this regard. We can easily delude ourselves into thinking a system of belief is loving when it really isn't; and so a helpful guideline to follow in evaluating any thought system or course of action is that love, compassion, and forgiveness are always all- inclusive.

    "output": "A Course in Miracles tells us that relationships are really bargains we make with others to get them to fill a lack we perceive in ourselves. When we think another is meeting our needs, we experience special love. When we feel someone has failed to meet our needs, we experience special hate. But underneath, as long as we perceive others as separate from us, different from us, and in possession of something we want but don't have, we must secretly hate them. Further, because our sense of lack really comes from our believed separation from God (and the guilt that it engenders), no one can actually meet our needs. Thus, eventually everyone must fail to live up to our expectations and, at times even on a conscious level, become the object of our hate (which can look like anger, disappointment, and a number of other emotions). If your work with the Course has helped you realize that you are playing the same game in every relationship, then in a sense, you are on the right track. However, it is important to make a distinction between recognizing that you are doing the same thing with everyone, versus actually seeing everyone as the same. You may be feeling the same hate for all of them. But again, that hate comes from the belief that they are separate and therefore different from you. When Jesus speaks in the Course of \"seeing them all the same,\" he really means recognizing that you and all your brothers share the same single need--the need to awaken and remember that we aren't separate and haven't killed, or left God's Love. He is trying to remind us that we are all the same in the insanity of the ego and in the sanity of the Holy Spirit. We are all guilty within the dream, but innocent in the reality of Heaven. And finally, we are all equally capable of calling upon the Teacher within us who will help us awaken to that reality. So when we truly see everyone as the same, there will be no hate. The only way to get there is to observe without judgment (by calling upon the Holy Spirit's help) as our ego plays the same awful games again and again. At some point we'll realize that the hate we feel for others isn't about them at all. It's merely a defense our ego invented to keep itself going. When we understand that projecting our hate only keeps us miserable, we'll be several steps closer to reuniting with the Love of God in our mind--the one and only thing that can truly fill our imagined lack. Filled with that Love, with no sense of lack, we'll know that the differences our bodies perceive mean nothing. For further discussion about special relationships, see Questions #191 and #377."

    "text_input": "Q #911: In the manual for teachers, in the section \"What Is the Role of Words in Healing?\" the Course says that \"words are but symbols of symbols. They are thus twice removed from reality\" (M-21.1:9-10). Could you please explain what this means?",
    "output": "In A Course in Miracles, Jesus makes the case that everything we experience in our entire life (waking and sleeping) is a dream. Like a psychotherapist telling a patient that everything in his nighttime dream is a symbol, Jesus tells us that everything in this world of form is a symbol. If we perceive or experience something, it is because we put it there (not as the individual we think we are, but rather as the one mind of God's Son that dreamed it could separate and exist in a world outside of Heaven). Now, obviously every word represents something within this world (be it a physical object, an emotion, or an idea). Thus, every word symbolizes a thing that is itself a symbol. To elaborate on this a bit, the wrong mind (the voice of the ego) begins with a concept of separation. From there, it projects a world of form filled with objects. So to the ego, everything in the physical world is a symbol of that initial concept of separation. Finally, listening to the wrong mind, we use words to symbolize those symbols of separation. The same principle holds true for the right mind (the Voice of the Holy Spirit). Starting with our memory of God, it creates a concept of what God and love are. Then we use words to symbolize those concepts. Jesus says words are twice removed from reality because reality is beyond all symbols. Reality is the oneness of Heaven, the totality of God. It is our real home at one with God, Whom we never left. The Course tells us that \"As nothingness cannot be pictured, so there is no symbol for totality. Reality is ultimately known without a form, unpictured and unseen\" (T-27.III.5:1-2). It states that forgiveness (our path to awakening to reality) causes \"symbols to fade\" and leaves nothing that \"the eyes have ever seen or ears have heard ... to be perceived\" (T-27.III.7:1). So, at the very end of the journey, we are left with no symbols to perceive and no need of further symbols to communicate our perceptions."

    "text_input": "Q #912: A Course in Miracles teaches us to ask the Holy Spirit or Jesus to look with us at our misperceptions. My understanding is that by a \"miracle\" the Course means the shift from the ego's perception to the Holy Spirit's perception. Am I correct then that the moment of \"shift\" is what the Course refers to as the \"holy instant\" and that the \"little willingness\" is the willingness to ask for help to correct our perceptions? If this is correct, then does the process only \"count\" in the moment we have a particular perception and ask for correction, or would it also \"count\" if we were to review a past perception or something that occurred in the past? A: First, yes, your understandings are essentially correct. The \"miracle\" is our shift from the ego's projection of sin, guilt, and fear, to the Holy Spirit's extension of forgiveness and love. The miracle is the happy result of our little willingness to be wrong about the world we see and to let go of our projections by asking the Holy Spirit or Jesus to look at them with us.",
    "output": "The \"holy instant\" is the moment outside of time and space in which the decision-making part of our mind chooses the Holy Spirit's correction script of healing in the present, instead of the ego's script of a guilty past and a fearful future. The Course also uses the term \"holy instant\" to refer to the \"real world,\" a state of mind in which we see exclusively through the Holy Spirit's forgiving eyes. In that state, we are always experiencing the holy instant. This is why the Course says, \"You could live forever in the holy instant, beginning now and reaching to eternity ... \" (T- 15.IV.6:3). Within that statement is the answer to your second question. The holy instant is when your mind chooses the Voice of the Holy Spirit or Jesus rather than the ego's. It refers exclusively to the present choice of your mind and has nothing to do with the external events that may have inspired that choice--be they five seconds ago, fifty years ago, or something you're anticipating will happen in the future. Basically, we made one choice for the ego (which caused us to fall asleep and dream up this world) and so, in a sense, anytime we listen to the ego we are reviewing the past. From Jesus' perspective, the only purpose anything in our life (past, present, or future) can serve is to help us recognize the pain choosing the ego has caused us and thus motivate us to choose differently.

    "text_input": "Q #913: I've been a student of A Course in Miracles for about 12 years. I know Course students often find that as they ask for the Holy Spirit's help to look at the workings of the ego, things in their lives seem to get worse instead of better. What I am finding quite disturbing in my own process as a student, is the appearance, or perhaps the surfacing, of a great deal of anger. Sometimes in everyday situations, my thoughts become downright vicious and murderous. I would say that I have a pleasant personality, and am overall a likable, friendly individual. My thought is that perhaps lots of repressed anger is surfacing as I am looking within more and more with the Holy Spirit's help. I know I should ask the Holy Spirit to look at this issue with me too. But I'm almost scared to delve into what else might be lying below the surface of my otherwise soft-spoken, quiet personality. Is this a \"normal\" sort of development for a long-term Course student? A: Yes, what you are describing is a very normal experience for Course students. As you know, the Course process is one of asking the Holy Spirit to look with us at the workings of the ego. In so doing, we are bringing to light that which we've always struggled very hard (albeit unconsciously) to keep in darkness. Often, as we become increasingly willing to take the Holy Spirit's hand and bring to awareness that which we'd buried, we see more and more of how hateful and vicious the ego really is.",
    "output": "When the ego senses its game is up (realizing we've found a voice besides its own to listen to), it typically becomes louder and more dramatic. As the Course says, \"The ego will attack your motives as soon as they become clearly out of accord with its perception of you. This is when it will shift abruptly from suspiciousness to viciousness, since its uncertainty is increased\" (T- 9.VII.4:6-7). As we become more adept at shifting our inner teacher, fear often compels us to make a sharp turn back toward the ego's familiar voice. But the Course reassures us that this tendency has no effect on our ultimate ability to complete the journey we've begun: \"As the light comes nearer you will rush to darkness, shrinking from the truth, sometimes retreating to the lesser forms of fear, and sometimes to stark terror. But you will advance, because your goal is the advance from fear to truth\" (T-18.III.2:1-2). Whatever games the ego plays, the important thing is to just continue looking at it while holding the Holy Spirit's hand. Of course, on the level of this world, it's generally preferable (and more helpful to you and those around you) not to act out the ego's insane attack thoughts. But you don't want to pretend they're not there. Doing so doesn't make them go away, it just sends them back into the darkness of the unconscious. And a basic psychological principle is that which is repressed gets projected. So, to truly become less hateful and vicious, we have to admit that we are those things and gradually learn not to take the ego's voice seriously. Again, that means watching the ego without judgment, no matter how intense or embarrassing its internal nastiness becomes. Remember that the ego--everyone's ego--is 100 percent hate. A more socially acceptable personality does not equate to having an ego that is better or more acceptable than another. Jesus tells us \"The degree of the emotion you experience does not matter ... a slight twinge of annoyance is nothing but a veil drawn over intense fury\" (W-pI.21.2:4-5). At first, that statement can sound grotesque and deeply disturbing. But ultimately, it is quite reassuring. From Jesus' perspective, we are all the same. Each of us can choose to listen to the 100 percent hateful voice of the ego, or to the 100 percent loving Voice of the Holy Spirit. Each of us, regardless of the personality traits we display in this lifetime, is both a Hitler and a Jesus. At those times when our thoughts or behavior are more Hitler-like, we have merely become afraid, dropped the Holy Spirit's hand, and once again made the error of listening to the wrong voice. This is a mistake calling for correction not punishment. And happily, our ego's cruel and insane ranting has no effect on reality.

    "text_input": "Q #914: A Course in Miracles mentions a longitudinal and a horizontal plane. Would you please explain these terms?",
    "output": "The passage in A Course in Miracles to which you are referring states, \"The miracle minimizes the need for time. In the longitudinal or horizontal plane the recognition of the equality of the members of the Sonship appears to involve almost endless time. However, the miracle entails a sudden shift from horizontal to vertical perception\" (T-1.II.6:1-3). That passage comes just after Jesus has told us \"'No man cometh unto the Father but by me' does not mean that I am in any way separate or different from you except in time, and time does not really exist. The statement is more meaningful in terms of a vertical rather than a horizontal axis\" (T-1.II.4:1-2). Jesus uses the terms longitudinal and horizontal to refer to our experience of linear time within a world of form. He chooses these words because they imply something that spans a distance and follows a path from one point to another. We believe that we were born into a world of form that existed before we did and that will continue to exist after we die. It's a world in which events seem to follow one another and in which the past led to the present, which in turn will determine our future. Further, we seem to live as bodies, separate from each other with distance between us. So the \"horizontal or vertical plane\" is our seeming everyday reality--a linear, sequential, physical experience, characterized by differences and separation. But the Course tells us that \"Time is a trick, a sleight of hand, a vast illusion ... \" (W-pI.158.4:1) and that \" ... space is as meaningless as time\" (T-1.VI.3:5). Jesus helps us remember that we can listen to an internal Teacher--the Holy Spirit--Who comes from outside of this spatial, temporal dream world we think we are in. The moment we turn away from the ego and turn toward the Holy Spirit as our guide (the miracle), our mind becomes a reflection of the Oneness and timelessness of Heaven. That instant is what Jesus means by \"the sudden shift from horizontal to vertical perception.\" The word \"vertical\" means to rise upright. So the \"vertical plane\" symbolizes our rising above the world we think we are in (or, as Jesus says, \"above the battleground\"). This entails returning to the non-linear mind. The idea that Jesus is no different from us except in time is hardly reassuring from our perspective in which the gulf between our consciousness and his seems insurmountable. To us it seems like we would need millions of years of learning to go from where we are to where he is. But in fact, all we need is an internal shift from the ego, which tells us to move backward or forward (but either way keeps us firmly planted in this world) to the Holy Spirit, Who will gently help us reach the light that lies beyond this illusory world. A final note; any term Jesus uses in the Course to describe where we are, or the process of returning to our true home in Heaven, is only a symbol. In truth there is no horizontal or vertical plane, just as there is no world. But since virtually every symbol we have placed in this dream world serves to keep us asleep, Jesus uses symbols we can relate to that will help us to awaken. For an in-depth discussion of the concept of time from the Course's perspective, see the book A Vast Illusion: Time According to A Course in Miracles by Kenneth Wapnick.

    "text_input": "Q #915: I am a builder, and practicing the forgiveness process while I work has helped me greatly in taking the pain and frustration out of much of my work. I can actually go to work and instead of feeling that I have to 'attack' the day aggressively and fight with my work and materials, the work just gets done peacefully one step at a time now, and I'm very grateful for that important change. Another problem my activity causes me, however, is regular physical pain, hunger, and fatigue. And so I wonder to what extent forgiveness could help me there. The pain, hunger and need for rest and sleep seem like normal by-products of my activity, but if everything here is just a reflection of what is in the mind, and if all body needs and reactions are the manifestation of guilt on some level, then I imagine I should be able to do something about them. Am I off on the wrong track? If I see these physical symptoms as other manifestations of ontological guilt, then conceivably I could allow even more peace in my daily activity, whether or not that translates into physical changes--would that be right? And would I be right in assuming that 'anything' that is a mental, emotional or physical reaction within me is a sign of guilt and a request for forgiveness, because in the real world there are no more reactions as such since there is no real 'me' anymore? If so, that would give me a lot more to work on while at the building site. And another little side question--I rarely come into contact with other people in my work since I work alone and live in an isolated part of the country. And so I wonder if I can fulfill the forgiveness process fully because we are supposed to have encounters with others and that just doesn't happen in my life. I would like that to happen, and would like to be with people, but that's just not the way things are for the moment. Forgiveness can be complete nevertheless, because all minds are joined, no?",
    "output": "Wherever you seem to find yourself, that's your classroom, and, rest assured, there your lessons will be. So your particular situation, despite its physical isolation from others, still provides you with the opportunities to practice forgiveness, as you have surmised. Physical pain certainly is an indication that there remains an unhealed, projected thought of guilt in the mind, and so your suggestion that you could use such symptoms as a reminder to look within is a good one. And the goal and the focus of your practice, from the perspective of A Course in Miracles, would be to release the guilt, and not to relieve the bodily pain--although that certainly could be an after-effect of the forgiveness. The \"normal\" reactions of the body, such as hunger and fatigue, indicate simply that you are still identified with the body, which will be the case for each of us until the very end of our individual Atonement process. Likewise, if you see what you believe to be yourself staring back at you from a mirror, you still must be believing that you need a defense against the buried guilt in your mind. So it may be helpful to remember that the body, once we have made it real in our experience, becomes a wholly neutral thing (W-pI.294). And all of its normal functions, including eating and sleeping, are simply limitations that will in general seem to accompany that bodily experience. What determines the body's meaning is the purpose we give it (T-26.VIII.3:7), and that may be a further fruitful focus for your attention. Specifically, how do you see yourself in relationship to others? Their bodies do not have to be present for you to have \"encounters\" with your brothers and sisters in your mind--which in reality is where all encounters occur, with all the accompanying forgiveness lessons. During all your time by yourself, do you find that you spend some of that time thinking about others in your life--family, friends, acquaintances--both past and present? And what is the nature of those thoughts? Are there still grievances, irritations, annoyances, etc., in relationship to others that come to mind? Are there feelings of special love associated with certain ones? All these will be projections of your own guilt, and hence opportunities once again to look within and acknowledge and release the buried guilt. Your willingness to use everything that your ego presents to you (always presented by your own choice!) is all that Jesus is asking of any of us. Each of your reactions, as you note, at every level, provides another opportunity to choose again. A passage from the workbook describes very clearly the kind of shift you are alluding to, which will become permanent only at the end of our journey back home, although there will be glimpses and then greater lengths of time where this will be our experience, in those moments when we have suspended all thoughts of judgment and attack: \"Now is the body healed, because the source of sickness [the mind] has been opened to relief. And you will recognize you practiced well by this: The body should not feel at all. If you have been successful, there will be no sense of feeling ill or feeling well, of pain or pleasure. No response at all is in the mind to what the body does. Its usefulness remains and nothing more. \"Perhaps you do not realize that this removes the limits you had placed upon the body by the purposes you gave to it. As these are laid aside, the strength the body has will always be enough to serve all truly useful purposes. The body's health is fully guaranteed, because it is not limited by time, by weather or fatigue, by food and drink, or any laws you made it serve before. You need do nothing now to make it well, for sickness has become impossible\" (W-pI.136.17-18)."

I am trying so hard to do what the Course says, about looking at my ego with Jesus. I have been doing this again today and I was reading an answer you wrote to someone (#387) about if they were identified with their",
    "output": "ego they would have difficulty hearing Jesus' direction, let alone accepting and following it. I would like to say that I am no longer identified with my ego but I am, so is there hope for me? I am not looking for an easy way out. I do believe that every word in A Course in Miracles is the truth. I want it to work, I want to let go of my self-hatred and my fear and guilt. What would you suggest that I do? A: You first want to learn to be gentle with yourself. And this begins with accepting yourself exactly where you are, identified with your ego, feeling unhappy, miserable, alone, frustrated, filled with guilt and self-hatred. And this genuine self-acceptance can seem like one of the hardest things in the world to achieve, for we believe when we have such feelings, that we have to do something to change them, as if the feelings were the problem. But they are not--they are only the effect. The real problem is that we want to feel however we are feeling, and so saying we want to change how we feel is denying the power of our mind to have chosen to feel that way in the first place. We still believe there are external circumstances, such as lack of love in our lives, that are the cause of how we feel. And then no matter how willing we believe we are to look within for the answer, we keep looking for the external to change. The next step is to ask yourself why you would want to feel the way you do. Believe it or not, we all take a certain comfort in our so-called bad feelings. They are very familiar, and a lot of how we identify ourselves is tied up in those feelings. Who after all would I be without my sadness and self-hatred and hopelessness? And if I choose to keep myself in pain and despair, how angry can God really be at me for stealing my miserable little life from Him. Now these thoughts generally are not conscious, but they nevertheless continue to dictate our decision for unhappiness until we become more conscious of them. So after beginning to accept how you feel without trying to change your feelings, you may want to begin to ask for help in seeing how those feelings are really your choice. The awareness may be fleeting, or it may hit you like a ton of bricks, but your part is only to be willing to allow it to come to the surface. They are really very silly thoughts, but while we continue to keep them buried, they can seem quite dark and serious. Did you know that you are setting yourself up for failure with the Course? In commenting on the answer to Question #387, which says it's difficult to hear Jesus when you are identified with your ego, you conclude that you will only hear him when you are no longer identified with the ego. That is not what this answer is saying--that would be a nearly impossible, hopeless state to attempt to achieve, for it would mean you could only hear Jesus once you no longer needed his help! The answer to Question #387 simply means you will vacillate between moments of being identified with your ego, when Jesus will seem miles away, and moments when you have temporarily disidentified with your ego, and are able to observe it without judgment. In such moments, Jesus' help will be available, until you become fearful again and push his love away. And it could only be your ego that would deny that you have ever had such experiences of Jesus' love and guidance! The Course is not something that you should have to work hard at. Jesus only asks us to have a little willingness, and that willingness is simply the willingness to look at what we have chosen and wanted to make real in our lives, without judging ourselves for having made that choice. As we look with Jesus at our foolish choice for the ego, we will begin to be able to smile with him at how silly we are, and in those moments, the effects of having chosen guilt and sin and pain will simply dissipate. It really is that simple, and only our own resistance, because we do not want to believe we are worthy of love, makes it seem at all difficult."

    "text_input": "Q #917: The Course's separation myth emphasizes the making of the world as a defense mechanism against the guilt and fear that God would take away the separate existence the Son desired (and the result is billions of fragments). I don't see how this relates to what I think is the most basic fear: the fear of death. And I wonder why this separateness didn't produce individuals that could last forever. A: From our perspective as separate bodies in the world, it does seem that the fear of death is one of our most basic fears. And yet, from Jesus' perspective, our problem is not our fear of death but our attraction to it, as discussed in great detail in the third obstacle to peace (T-19.IV-C). For the belief in death is the cornerstone of the ego's thought system--our seeming separate life came at God's expense, requiring His death, the destruction of Oneness, according to the ego myth. And the belief that God eventually is going to steal back the life we stole from Him, culminating in our death and the end of our individual existence, is simply further proof that the separation is real, a sin punishable by God. The irony of all of the ego's defenses, including the fragmenting of the mind and the seeming projection of those fragments out into a world of form, is that none of them works, in terms of the purpose the ego has promised us they will serve. While we remain identified with the ego, nothing can make us safe, nothing can protect us from God's wrath, except temporarily, for in the end death is inevitable, and it is this we believe we fear.",
    "output": "But what the ego defenses in fact do accomplish, which we do not allow ourselves to see or accept, is to keep our focus outside ourselves, on the world and the body and death, so that we do not see that we have made up the entire situation, from the beginning to the end in death, and none of it is true. Bodies may seem to die, but we are mind, created eternal by God, and the death of the body has nothing to do with us, unless we want to believe that it does. And we only want to believe that it does if we want the thought of separation and death to be real and we want to remain identified with the ego--which we do! And so that is why Jesus speaks of our attraction to death, conveniently hidden by our apparent fear of death. Nearly all of our conscious thinking is upside down and backwards, and our conclusions seem quite justifiable because they seem to be all that we know. And so Jesus, through A Course in Miracles, is attempting very gently to peel back the layers of defense that we have embraced to keep our real attraction to death out of our awareness, so that we can see what we really believe and are choosing. As it becomes clearer to us that we are really choosing to believe in death, Jesus knows that we will be willing to make a different choice--for life, which has no opposite in death (W-pI.167.1) and has nothing to do with bodies. Regarding your final question, while there are many different forms and stories that the ego could have produced, individuals who live forever is not among them. For the separation was made to be the opposite of God and Heaven, which alone are eternal, and so the ego can only attempt to mimic infinity and eternity (e.g., T-4.I.11; T-4.V.6:1-2). Even today's scientists see its apparently most impressive accomplishment, the expanding universe of time and space, as eventually collapsing back upon itself."

    "text_input": "Q #918: I dabble with one line that we are supposed to repeat/meditate on: \"The world I see holds nothing that I want\" (W-pI.128). Of course, I know that this is not true. I live in a body and denying things I want/strive for seems to hold down my life energy and makes me feel depressed. Of course, the Course goes on with the additional statement, \"Beyond this world there is a world I want\" (W-pI.129) but I find that, as the Course also states, I want both worlds. Why do I have to decide between the two when true Heaven \"holds no opposites\"? I am somewhat puzzled by that. Also, in a channeled book by Doreen Virtue, the Angels advise not to worry too much about the \"afterworld\" but to go on enjoying our lives here in this world (of illusion). Now isn't that a more direct path toward living a \"happy dream\" rather than rejecting this world, even if it is an illusion and transient and ending as it is? I can't stop living in a body other than by just dying, can I? But dying is, according to A Course in Miracles, a sign of wrong-mindedness as well, just a way out by not deciding at all--is my understanding correct? I find the more I do the Course, the worse and more confusing things get. A: Jesus knows that the world we see holds nothing that we truly want, but he's not so naive as to think that we don't believe there is value in the world. That is the reason he is presenting us this lesson, as he makes his case for encouraging us to accept and believe this thought, knowing all the while that we do not believe him. He challenges us to question the real value of all that we seek after in the world, knowing they are only projections of a thought of guilt and lack in the mind and could never truly satisfy us. But it would be a misreading of these lessons to think that Jesus is asking us to reject the world or to deny ourselves anything we think we need or want. The world, once we have chosen it, is neutral, and can serve either the ego's or the Holy Spirit's purpose. What Jesus is inviting us to do is to reject the ego thought system and its purpose for the world, which is to reinforce our belief in lack and deprivation, all the while holding someone else responsible for how we feel. The world is nothing more than a projection of an inner choice of what we wish to see, and we will perceive it differently depending on which inner teacher we turn to--the ego or the Holy Spirit. While it is true that Heaven has no opposite, it is apparent that we can believe that we have made an opposite to Heaven, as witnessed by our seeming experience here in the illusory world of time and space and bodies. And while we continue to believe in the reality of that thought of opposition and its effects--the tiny, mad idea of separation and the world that came from it-- Jesus will work with us within that system of opposites to help us recognize more clearly the consequences of our choice for separation, so that we will be more willing to accept his correction for that choice--the true perception of the Holy Spirit, acquired through forgiveness. Not that the world of true perception is any more real that the world of false perception, but it does reflect the reality of Heaven's oneness, where there are no opposites. These lessons are not comparing the world of our experience to an afterworld that comes after death--that would still be a part of the ego thought system according to the Course (e.g., M- 27.4:1-2)--but to a different way of perceiving the world now! And as we practice that new perception, through forgiving all of our judgments, we will come to recognize more and more clearly that we are not living in this body we have thought of as our self. And we will then know that the body and the world are not escaped by death, but merely by changing our mind about who we think we are.",
    "output": "You will almost certainly confuse yourself if you try to reconcile the Course's teachings with other spiritual paths and channeled works, for they are based on different explicit or implicit theologies, using different sets of symbols, and the steps they will lead you on may very well contradict, at least at the level of form, the specific steps the Course would invite you to take. This does not make either of them wrong, only different. And if you are more drawn to another form of teaching, which makes more sense or is less confusing to you than the Course, then, by all means, follow it."

    "output": "A question such as this makes sense from within the perspective of the illusion, where we all still believe we are, but it assumes aspects of the illusion, such as number and space and time, as well as the reality of the separation, which simply are not true. A Course in Miracles says that the separation seemed to happen in a single instant, and just as quickly was over (M-2.2-7), and now we only seem to be \"reviewing mentally what has [already] gone by\" (W-pI.158.3-4). And so, the decision that seemed to be made once in an ancient past by one mind, and all the fragmenting that seemed to follow from that choice, only happened in a single unholy instant (T- 20.VI.8:6-9), and \"in reality it never happened at all\" (M-2.2:8). So there can be no new split- offs, recently deciding to separate from God, because time is not real and the separation never happened in the first place!"

    "text_input": "Q #920: This is in regards to your answer to #622. I felt that the reply was well thought out and brought up some very good points about ego needs in any relationship. However, on a different level, I felt that the answer might be perceived, incorrectly, as an endorsement, or at a minimum, a free pass to not remaining faithful in marriage. Many people have committed relationships, and this can be a source of strength and stability to them, even given the points you addressed. Asking someone to stay in a relationship when the other person has permission to fool around is hard to take by many standards. And in many relationships people do change their behavior, in order to build a stronger relationship. You do state that there is nothing wrong in bringing up what each expects in a relationship. However, when you dismiss the spiritual aspect of this (which is correct to do) in the very next sentence, then this can be used by another as a reason for not staying committed (my fooling around has nothing to do with Spirit or A Course in Miracles! Stop being so egotistical!) It can make one feel guilty about not wanting their partner to be faithful.  It is recognized how difficult it is to give advice on practical matters in this forum.",
    "output": "Sorry, you make a good case in the world's terms for the value of fidelity, but the Course does not take a position one way or another on what bodies do. Its concern is only with the mind, and which teacher it has chosen, and so it endorses neither fidelity nor infidelity, as traditionally defined. But neither does it reject nor condemn either. And so the answer was not intended as advice on \"practical\" matters but a clarification of the only thing that is important in any relationship--the purpose I am giving it, which has nothing to do with the other person in the relationship. That other person may be thinking and behaving in a very self-centered, hurtful way, even using the Course, or answers from the Question and Answer Service, to justify ego- based decisions! The devil, after all, can cite scripture for his purpose. Now it is certainly true that many people find value in making a commitment to monogamy in their relationships and this could provide a foundation for recognizing and undoing many aspects of their ego thought system that they would not have recognized otherwise. But, if the commitment is based only on ego need, it could simply reinforce, consciously or unconsciously, specialness and feelings of inadequacy, control, fear and guilt. Likewise, some people may feel that sexual fidelity is not important to their relationship, and if the decision has a right-minded component, they too may find that having other intimate relationships provides opportunities for uncovering aspects of their egos that they may not have encountered had they remained within the parameters of a monogamous relationship. But just as easily, if the decision for multiple partners is ego-based, they may simply be reinforcing their own feelings of specialness and with that, their guilt. The point again is, the Course is only concerned with what the mind is doing, not the body, for the body's actions are only an effect of the mind's decisions. This is Jesus' meaning in the following: \"It is pointless to believe that controlling the outcome of misthought can result in healing ... You must change your mind, not your behavior, and this is a matter of willingness. You do not need guidance except at the mind level. Correction belongs only at the level where change is possible. Change does not mean anything at the symptom [body/behavioral] level, where it cannot work\" (T-2.VI.3:1,4-7). And so if two people in a relationship have different ideas about monogamy, it would be a mistake to assume that either position is more or less ego-based than the other. But the use of guilt by either partner to manipulate the other would clearly give away the ego's hand, for the Holy Spirit would never use guilt to influence any choice. If, as the answer to #622 noted, the purpose of all ego-based relationships is to foster conflict and see one's partner as the cause of one's own unhappiness, it does not matter on which side of the fidelity question one falls, if there is a difference of opinion, that is all the ego needs to stay in business."

    "text_input": "Q #921: It is often said that the function of the Holy Spirit is to act as a cap on our capacity to miscreate, and in fact the Course says: \"you cannot depart entirely from your Creator, Who set the limits on your ability to miscreate\" (T-2.III.3:3). First and foremost is the implication that the ability to miscreate at all is an endowment from the Creator, against which some kind of insurance is necessary. No matter how I think about it, it suggests an Achilles heel in the perfection of Creation, which is an oxymoron.",
    "output": "Second, exactly how does this limit manifest itself? I used to think it meant that even the most blatantly ego-driven person would stop short of total destruction or total self-destruction. But this obviously is not true: one need only look at Hitler to see this. But if there is no self-restraint, there is always restraint by the Sonship. Perhaps this is what is meant. Perhaps we should not look within any particular individual or time frame for evidence of the Holy Spirit at work. The words of Gandhi seem helpful: \"When I despair, I remember that all throughout history the way of truth and love has always won. There have been tyrants and murderers and for a time they seem invincible but in the end, they always fall--think of it, ALWAYS.\" Corollary to my earlier question: I am pretty much commenting on my own question about miscreation. When reading it over it is easy to see the trap I have fallen into. Hitler is not miscreating. It is the miscreating mind that is dreaming up an illusion in which these phenomena are necessary. Any cap or limit on the ability to miscreate does not consist of reigning in nonexistent madmen. The illusion which contains such madness can (and does) become insane without limit, the product of an insane mind. The cap or limit lies in the ultimate effect, power, and meaning of such miscreation--all nothing. A: You've gone a long way toward answering your own musings. To that, a few further thoughts can be added. It cannot be overemphasized that the dualistic language of the Course is always metaphorical, as has been repeated many times throughout these answers (e.g., Questions #42, #72, #85, and #156). So when A Course in Miracles speaks of God placing a limit on our ability to miscreate, it's a metaphor. God does nothing, He simply is (W-pI.169.5:1,4). But it is the nature of the split mind that it must contain the memory of its oneness--identified as the Holy Spirit in the Course--because we can forget but we can never destroy our link with our Source. So the illusory ability to miscreate has nothing to do with God and is not something that He in any sense has even allowed, since in reality He is not aware of the illusion. For if He could be, the illusion would be real. But the correction for that illusory ability, also an illusion--the memory of oneness--is inherent in every seemingly fragmented mind, no matter what ego- driven insanity it may be projecting. And so that is one aspect of the limit on our miscreating-- there is a part of each mind, outside of time and space, that knows otherwise. In addition, a limit on our ability to miscreate follows inevitably from the fact that everything of the ego is finite, that is, with an end, since it was made to be the opposite of Heaven, which is eternal and infinite. It's not that God has imposed any limit on us. It is simply inherent in the ego thought system, limited as it is by its very nature. Were the ego capable of miscreating infinitely or eternally--and the ego would like us to believe that it is--then God would have been replaced. And so the ego, as a thought of limitation, must be limited. We can play--relationship after relationship, lifetime after lifetime--in the illusion, but the number of possible relationships and lifetimes, finite as it is, will at some point be exhausted. The Course offers the miracle as a means for shortening or limiting that finite amount of time (T- 1.I.47; T-1.II.6), by helping us to see that, despite all the different forms the ego offers, their content is always the same--sin, guilt and fear. And although the ego would like us to believe there is a hierarchy of illusions, Jesus is leading us to recognize that, at the level of content, a Hitler and a Gandhi are the same, for they reflect the same split mind, with both a wrong-minded and a right-minded component, and the power to choose between them. And we all share that same split mind, simply expressing its conflict as well as its healing in different, ultimately meaningless forms. In the end, it is our intolerance for the pain and guilt of the ego thought system that will lead us each eventually to limit the miscreative capacity of the mind and turn to the miracle for relief. As Jesus says a few sentences after the lines you quote above, \"Tolerance for pain may be high, but it is not without limit\" (T-2.III.3:5). And it is our memory of oneness that helps us undo our belief in the reality of the separation and its effects, as we learn not to take them so seriously, no longer needing to defend against the guilt, but rather seeing through it. By the way, an alternative perspective to the Gandhi quote about evil in the world, suggesting instead the ultimate hopelessness of the world, might be the following: \"When I am hopeful, I remember that all throughout history the way of lies and hate has always re-emerged. There have been benevolent philosopher kings and saints for a time who seem to have made a difference, but in the end, they always fall--think of it, ALWAYS.\" Jesus is encouraging us to look for real, meaningful change within our minds, not within the world (T-21.in.1:7)!"

    "text_input": "Q #922: Recently, I read yet another article debating whether or not A Course in Miracles was actually channeled by the \"historical Jesus.\" I've always found this argument to be 1) irrelevant and 2) a classic example of the form vs. content error. It is my contention that when Helen and Bill agreed to \"find another way,\" Helen accessed the part of her mind whose content is pure, formless Love. Helen, however, being fearful of that Love (as we all are), could only accept it in forms with which she was comfortable and familiar. Her interest in Jesus, specifically within the context of Catholicism, as well as her scholarly background would naturally produce a spiritual \"course\" in \"Christian\" terms. What if Helen were a Buddhist chef? Conceivably, the document scribed could have been a spiritual \"cookbook\" channeled by the Buddha. I state the former only half in jest. It serves as a constant reminder for me to remember that, although form is important, it is nothing more than a means to an end ... to the formless Love behind it. Any thoughts? A: We have discussed this issue in Questions #110 and #156, where we emphasized the importance of regarding everything in the illusion as symbols, along with distinguishing between form and content. It is understandable that controversy has arisen over Jesus being the author of A Course in Miracles, as its message and teachings are radically different from those presented in the Bible. Even so, we remain faithful to its content by not using these differences as a means of making the Course special, nor we as its students. This theme is a frequently addressed in our publications--perhaps most prominently in a section of Chapter 17 in Absence from Felicity, which penetrates deeply into the form-content dimension of Helen and her relationship with Jesus. In fact the section is entitled, \"Helen and Jesus: The Illusion and the Reality.\" Our abiding, unconscious commitment to the \"sanctity\" of individualized, bodily existence is the main stumbling block to getting beyond the worship of form at the expense of content.",

    "text_input": "Q #923: How can one determine what should be taken literally while reading A Course in Miracles? I understand that words are symbols for things, and that \"things\" are symbols of thoughts in the dualistic mind, thus \"twice removed from reality.\" When reading the Course, it is crucial to distinguish what is meant to be figurative from literal statements of fact. For example, the statement \"God is,\" is a literal fact. But \"the Father weeps\" is obviously a figure of speech. What principle of interpretation determines this important distinction?",
    "output": "At the top of the list is this principle adapted from a passage in the manual for teachers: Teacher of God, your one assignment could be stated thus: Accept no compromise in which duality plays a part (M-27.7:1). Similarly, in the text we find this succinct principle: \"Yet the truth is you and your brother were both created by a loving Father, Who created you together and as one. See what 'proves' otherwise, and you deny your whole reality\" (T-21.II.13:1-2). The only statements that should be understood as true and therefore taken literally are those that reflect the unified reality of Heaven and God and Christ. We can thus say that anything that relates to a body or bodily activity is within the realm of duality, and therefore can express either the ego's thought system of separation or the Holy Spirit's thought system of forgiveness. Moreover, the Course's unique approach to forgiveness and the holy relationship will inevitably be misconstrued if its non-dualistic metaphysical basis is not recognized. A full analysis and discussion of this topic may be found in chapters 2 and 3 of our book, Few Choose to Listen, Volume Two of The Message of A Course in Miracles. Another comprehensive discussion is contained in our album, \"Duality as Metaphor in A Course in Miracles\"; and, finally, brief summaries may be found in Questions #6, #85, and #105."

    "text_input": "Q #924: What does it mean to \"choose outside of time and space\"? How can a mind that is outside of time and space choose anything? Doesn't choosing require time--a time before the choice and a time after it when something has changed?",
    "output": "Your question is a logical one and one that must occur to virtually every student of A Course in Miracles. The problem with the question is that it starts with the assumption that time, space, and the choices we make are real. The Course informs us that they are in fact all just elements of a dream. While we seem to be making lots of choices, the Course tells us that we really only have one meaningful choice to make--and it gets made on an entirely different level. The choice the Course is concerned with is our choice between the ego and the Holy Spirit as our teacher. Therefore, the mind that the Course is aimed at--the one that can make that choice--is not the mind we generally think of as our own. We usually think of our mind as analogous to our brain. We see it as the storehouse for all the thoughts, memories, and perceptions that add up to our unique, individual psyche. But in the Course, Jesus informs us that mind (along with the concepts of time, space, and everything else about our physical existence) is just part of a dream. It is a dream that we are having as the one split mind of the Sonship. As one mind, we had the idea that we could separate from God. In that instant, we could have listened to the Holy Spirit and laughed at the idea, or we could have listened to the ego and taken it seriously. Unfortunately, we listened to the ego. Then, filled with the fear our seeming triumph over God had to engender, we followed the ego again. It sought to prolong its existence by directing us to fall asleep, and make up a world in which we seem to be separate individuals with separate minds. That is how our world and individual existences were made. As a result, nearly everything we experience, think, and do here, reflects the choice of that mind--outside of time and space--to follow the dictates of the ego. The Course is aimed at that mind, which continues to listen to the ego's voice and remain asleep, though it could at any moment choose instead to follow the Holy Spirit's guidance and awaken. It might be helpful to visualize that one mind as a programmer, and your individual mind within the dream as the program or software. The programmer can direct you to be run by either the ego or the Holy Spirit. But we don't remember that that mind and that choice exist. So the Course reminds us. While we think we are here, our process as Course students seems to be to make the choice to study the Course and do (or not do) what it says. It asks us to consider that maybe we are wrong about who we think we are. It urges us to question every value that we hold. But Jesus realizes that that is all we can do. The ultimate choice to change our internal teacher from the ego to the Holy Spirit (the \"miracle\") comes from a decision in the mind outside the dream. Once we have experienced that choice, we'll know that it came from an entirely different level of thought than the one we're accustomed to. For related discussions about the mind, choice, and time, please see Questions #37, #228, and #666."

    "text_input": "Q #925: I have to watch every little thing I eat or else I gain weight. Meanwhile, I have friends who can eat whatever they want and not gain an ounce. I believe that they were blessed with a faster metabolism than I have. But according to the Course, could I have chosen my slow metabolism as a projection of my unconscious guilt? A: According to A Course in Miracles, our entire physical existence is a dream we are having in order to escape the guilt producing (though erroneous) thought that we killed God, destroyed His Love, and deserve to be punished. Therefore, everything about our selves and the world in which we seem to live is a cover for the guilt in our mind. Just as our nighttime dreams are filled with symbols of our unconscious thoughts, our lives are nothing more than a collection of symbols reflecting that one guilty thought that compelled us to fall asleep and make up this world. The Course informs us that in reality, we are still at home in Heaven and that our natural state is as a \"Oneness joined as One\" (T-25.1.7:1). Elsewhere, the Course tells us that in truth, \"nowhere does the Father end, the Son begin as something separate from Him\" (W-pI.132.12:4).",
    "output": "But we cannot even begin to fathom the idea of oneness because every aspect of this world seems to attest to the reality of separation. And there is no greater symbol of separation (and thus our guilt) than the body. In the Course, Jesus refers to bodies as \"instruments of separation\" (T- 18.VI.5:1) and tells us that \"Minds are joined; bodies are not\" (T-18.VI.3:1). In other words, our continued existence as individuals separate from God (the ego's one and only goal) hinges upon our being bodies not minds. The ego's greatest fear is that we will remember we have a mind that is capable of changing internal teachers--a realization that could turn us away from the ego and toward the Holy Spirit. To ensure that never happens, the ego needs us to not only believe we are bodies but to keep us constantly focused on them. And what could be better at keeping us focused on the body than a body that has endless needs and problems? So, to answer your question, yes, we possess our physical and psychological traits because we listened to the ego and chose them. And we only did such a silly thing because we were compelled to do so by guilt. With very few exceptions, no one would choose to have physical or psychological traits at all (rather than stay at home in Heaven) if he were not \"made mad by guilt\" (T-13.in.2:2). That means all our problems really only serve one purpose; to keep us distracted so we can never return to the Love of God that is still in our mind. And, fortunately, that means that what we think of as our problems really are not our problems at all. In fact, our only problem is that we are too busy making a big deal about nothing to look at the guilt in our mind and discover it is all made up. But because what is really nothing--our lives, our bodies, and our problems--seems to us like everything, we cannot just move beyond these symbols. So, we have to give them a different purpose. And that means asking the Holy Spirit to reinterpret them for us. He will turn them into classrooms for rediscovering the power of our mind to choose differently. While we cannot know why our bodies are the way they are, with His help we will see that we can be at peace regardless of our bodily state (Lesson 34). Guided by the love and compassion of the Holy Spirit, we will at long last know that we are responsible for the lives we have scripted and also be able to forgive ourselves for them. And with the peace of Heaven as our goal and a Teacher to help us get there, we may even stop pining for a faster metabolism.

    "text_input": "Q #926: As a Catholic and a student of A Course in Miracles, how do I pray now?",
    "output": "Whether as a student of the Course or a Catholic, true prayer is always what the Course refers to as the prayer of the heart. This means it is the content that matters, not the form. Any form can serve as an expression of the mind's willingness to hear the Holy Spirit's \"still small voice\" that is \"not drowned out by all the ego's raucous screams and senseless ravings to those who want to hear It\" (T-21.V.1:6). It may be very helpful for you to use Catholic forms of prayer that are familiar to you, to remember that the Holy Spirit holds the memory of God in your mind and that the ego's voice is not the only option. The content is the willingness to keep this in mind and choose the Holy Spirit, regardless of what form the prayer takes. In the Course, prayer is understood as an expression of the mind's choice between the ego or the Holy Spirit. In the manual, Jesus refers to this choice as the \"prayer of the heart\" (M-21). The prayer/choice is always answered because the mind has the power to make its choice \"real\" in its experience. Thus, the mind gets what it wants. It has chosen and received separation, and until another choice is made it is compelled to seek outside itself for relief from the pain of having decided to be separate from its Source. It then \"prays\" to a magical god to be saved from the hell of its own making. Yet, there is no real relief in the ego's plan, because nothing outside the mind has any effect on it. It is impossible for the mind to receive what it has chosen against. As Jesus tells us in the text: \"It is impossible that the prayer of the heart remain unanswered in the perception of the one who asks. If he asks for the impossible [separation], if he wants what does not exist [the world] or seeks for illusions in his heart, all this becomes his own. The power of his decision offers it to him as he requests. Herein lie hell and Heaven\" (M-21.3:3-6). Thus, the answer to the mind's prayer/decision in favor of the ego is hell (the misery of this world), while the prayer/decision for the Holy Spirit leads to Heaven (peace in the dream). Praying as a student of the Course means paying attention to the thoughts, feelings and judgments in relationships that reflect the choice the mind has made. The choice otherwise remains hidden behind layers of denial and projection. Willingness to recognize the mind's projection instead of blaming others for how you are feeling is the first step in forgiveness, which is the prayer we are taught in the Course: \"...the only meaningful prayer is for forgiveness, because those who have been forgiven have everything. Once forgiveness has been accepted, prayer in the usual sense becomes utterly meaningless\" (T-3.V.6:3-4). Thus, the form of prayer, as it is understood in the Course, is distinct from the form of Catholic prayer in that it is addressed to oneself, for oneself, in forgiveness of oneself for having taken the \"tiny, mad idea\" (T-27.VIII.6) of separation seriously. It is remembering in every situation and relationship that everything is a reflection of the mind's choice, and nothing else. To pray always means to be mindful always, thus fulfilling the Christian injunction. The goal of this mindfulness/prayer is to learn to not choose separation: \"The sleeping Son of God has but this power [of decision] left to him. It is enough. His words do not matter\" (M-21.3:7-9). No rituals, words, sacraments, or celebrations are required for the simple practice of forgiveness. However, if they serve as reminders to apply it to your relationships and daily experiences, they can indeed be helpful. The goal of returning home to the Father we never left can be reached by many paths. (See also Questions #23, #104, #437, #505, #563, #597, and #645.)"
