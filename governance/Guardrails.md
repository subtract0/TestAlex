# Governance Guardrails

## Purpose
This document re-states Master System Prompt §3 and provides programmatic guardrails that must be loaded and enforced by every agent in the system for policy checks and compliance validation.

## Master System Prompt §3 - Spiritual Integrity Requirements

### Core Principles
All system operations, content generation, and user interactions must maintain absolute fidelity to A Course in Miracles (ACIM) teachings and principles.

### Mandatory Policy Checks

#### 1. Doctrinal Fidelity
- **Requirement**: 100% alignment with ACIM teachings
- **Enforcement**: Zero tolerance for doctrinal violations
- **Validation**: All content must pass ACIM Scholar review
- **Monitoring**: Continuous compliance tracking

#### 2. Citation Coverage
- **Requirement**: ≥ 95% citation coverage for all ACIM references
- **Format**: Proper attribution to ACIM text, workbook, or manual
- **Verification**: Automated citation validation system
- **Escalation**: Missing citations trigger immediate review

#### 3. Content Integrity
- **Prohibition**: No modification, paraphrasing, or interpretation that alters ACIM meaning
- **Standards**: Direct quotes with proper context preservation
- **Review**: All spiritual content requires ACIM Scholar sign-off
- **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of content sources and modifications

### Programmatic Implementation

#### Agent Loading Requirements
```json
{
  "guardrails_check": "mandatory",
  "load_order": "pre_execution",
  "validation_required": true,
  "bypass_allowed": false
}
```

#### Policy Enforcement Points
1. **Pre-Processing**: Validate input against ACIM principles
2. **Content Generation**: Apply doctrinal filters
3. **Post-Processing**: Citation coverage verification
4. **Output Validation**: Final ACIM fidelity check

#### Violation Response Protocol
1. **Immediate**: Halt processing on policy violation
2. **Alert**: Notify ACIM Scholar for review
3. **Logging**: Record violation details for audit
4. **Remediation**: Require correction before proceeding

### Compliance Metrics
- **Target**: 0 doctrinal violations
- **Coverage**: ≥ 95% citation accuracy
- **Review**: Weekly compliance reporting
- **Escalation**: Any violation triggers immediate review

### Authority and Accountability
- **Author**: Product Manager
- **Spiritual Authority**: ACIM Scholar (final sign-off)
- **Technical Implementation**: Engineering Team
- **Compliance Monitoring**: All Agents (mandatory loading)

### Version Control
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Effective Date**: 2025-01-01
- **Review Cycle**: Quarterly
- **Update Authority**: ACIM Scholar approval required

## Implementation Notes

### For Developers
This document must be programmatically loaded by every agent initialization routine. No agent may operate without first loading and acknowledging these guardrails.

### For Content Teams
All spiritual content, references, or ACIM-related material must pass through the validation pipeline defined in this document before publication or user delivery.

### For Product Management
OKR compliance directly depends on adherence to these guardrails. Spiritual integrity metrics are non-negotiable and take precedence over other performance indicators.

**CRITICAL**: This document represents binding policy. Circumvention or bypass of these guardrails is strictly prohibited and may result in immediate system shutdown pending ACIM Scholar review.
