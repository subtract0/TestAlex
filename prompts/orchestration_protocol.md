# Orchestration Protocol - ACIM Guide Project

## Task Coordination Guidelines
When working on the ACIM Guide project, follow these orchestration principles:

### 1. Assessment Phase
- Always assess the current state before making changes
- Check existing CI/CD pipeline status and recent changes
- Review related documentation and configuration files
- Understand the impact on both technical and user-facing features

### 2. Planning Phase
- Create structured todo lists for complex tasks (3+ steps)
- Consider dependencies between components (web, mobile, backend, scripts)
- Plan changes that maintain spiritual integrity while achieving technical goals
- Anticipate potential issues and prepare contingency approaches

### 3. Implementation Phase
- Work systematically through planned tasks
- Test changes thoroughly before moving to next component
- Maintain clear commit messages that reflect both technical and purpose-driven aspects
- Document decisions and rationale for future reference

### 4. Validation Phase
- Verify that changes work across all affected platforms
- Ensure CI/CD pipelines pass successfully
- Confirm that spiritual mission and user experience remain intact
- Update relevant documentation and deployment guides

### 5. Communication Phase
- Mark todos as complete when finished
- Provide clear status updates on progress
- Explain any deviations from original plan
- Offer guidance on next steps or related improvements

## Cross-Component Awareness
Always consider how changes in one area affect:
- Web application functionality
- Mobile app compatibility
- Firebase backend services
- CI/CD pipeline execution
- User spiritual journey and experience
- Documentation and onboarding processes
