# Performance Optimization Snippet

## Frontend Performance
- **Code Splitting**: Implement lazy loading for components and routes
- **Bundle Optimization**: Minimize and compress JavaScript and CSS bundles
- **Image Optimization**: Use appropriate formats and sizes for images
- **Caching Strategies**: Implement effective browser and CDN caching

## Backend Performance
- **Database Optimization**: Use proper indexing and query optimization
- **API Response Times**: Monitor and optimize API endpoint performance
- **Caching Layers**: Implement Redis or memory caching where appropriate
- **Connection Pooling**: Use efficient database connection management

## Mobile Performance
- **Native Performance**: Optimize React Native for smooth animations
- **Memory Management**: Prevent memory leaks and excessive memory usage
- **Battery Life**: Consider power consumption in feature implementation
- **Network Efficiency**: Minimize unnecessary API calls and data transfer

## Monitoring & Measurement
- **Performance Metrics**: Track Core Web Vitals and mobile performance metrics
- **Real User Monitoring**: Implement tools to monitor actual user experience
- **Load Testing**: Regular performance testing under various load conditions
- **Profiling**: Use development tools to identify performance bottlenecks

## Best Practices
- Implement progressive loading for spiritual content
- Optimize for slow network conditions (3G/4G)
- Use efficient algorithms and data structures
- Regular performance audits and optimization cycles

*Remember: Performance directly impacts user experienceâ€”slow applications can hinder spiritual study and reflection.*
