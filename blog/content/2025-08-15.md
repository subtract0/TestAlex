# ACIM Lesson 2: I have given everything I see all the meaning that it has for me

Today's lesson builds directly on yesterday's recognition that nothing we see has inherent meaning. Now we take responsibility for the meanings we've assigned to everything in our experience.

This is perhaps one of the most liberating recognitions in the Course: you are not at the mercy of external circumstances because you are the one giving them their meaning. The situation itself is neutral - your interpretation makes it "good" or "bad," "threatening" or "safe."

## Understanding Today's Lesson

When you look at anything today - a person, object, or situation - remind yourself:
- I have given this desk all the meaning it has for me
- I have given that person all the meaning they have for me
- I have given this situation all the meaning it has for me

This isn't about blame or guilt. It's about recognizing your power to choose your interpretation, and therefore your experience.

## The Freedom in Responsibility

Taking responsibility for the meanings you assign might initially feel heavy, but it's actually the key to freedom. If you gave something its meaning, you can give it a different meaning. If you made someone into an enemy, you can see them differently. If you decided a situation was hopeless, you can choose hope.

## Practical Application with CourseGPT

CourseGPT can help you identify the meanings you've unconsciously assigned to people and situations in your life. Often we don't realize how many judgments and interpretations we're carrying. Through gentle questioning, CourseGPT can help you see these patterns and choose differently.
